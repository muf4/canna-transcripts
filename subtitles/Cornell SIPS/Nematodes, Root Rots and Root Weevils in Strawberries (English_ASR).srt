welcome again to the nazca 2011 winter

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,099
webinar series we hope that you found

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,070
these webinars to be interesting and

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,970
informative this webinar is the last one

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,549
in the series for 2011 our speakers

6
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:35,200
today are dr. James lamantia who's going

7
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,929
to be talking about nematodes and root

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,180
rots and dr. Richard calls will be

9
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:43,058
discussing advances in weevil management

10
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:45,219
both are from the connect a Greek ulch

11
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:47,530
Earl experiment station just a few

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:49,390
housekeeping things before we start if

13

you're interested in viewing the

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,929
recorded webinars if you look in the web

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,420
links box over here you'll see webinar

16
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:02,590
archive if you click on that you'll see

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,448
a URL appears in the browse to box just

click on that and it will open in a

19
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:10,030
window behind this window and all of the

20
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:14,409
recorded webinars will be there for you

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,939
to access later the other thing is we're

22
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,849
interested in having some feedback from

23
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:22,149
you about the series and so we have a

24
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:23,618
short five question online survey this

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,049
will help us determine the effectiveness

26
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:27,368
of this type of program what you liked

27
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,860
about it what you may not have liked

28
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:32,859
about it and then possible topics of

29
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:35,769
interest for a future series hosted by

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,739
Nazca and if you click on again in the

31
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:41,679
web link box on the exit survey you'll

32
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:43,089
find the URL there and you can just

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,430
browse there and it should take you

34
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,549
maybe five minutes at the most to

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:54,130
complete the survey for us in terms of

36
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,590
Nazca and their hosting of the winter

37
00:01:54,129 --> 00:02:01,629
webinar series we wish to thank you very

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,759
much Nazca for hosting the series and

39
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:06,810
there are some membership information

40
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,039
for you that we hope you'll look through

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,259
why would you consider joining an

42
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,419
association like Nazca what what are the

43
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:16,149
membership benefits to that and then a

44
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:18,518
membership application blank and those

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,489
are in the file share box in the bottom

46
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,379
right side of your screen we did have

47
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:25,359
some people registering even today for

48
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,289
this last webinar and so I'll just give

49
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:30,360
a brief reminder of the options that you

50
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,099
have if

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,010
are interested in in commenting or

52
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,719
asking a question in the bottom of the

53
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:39,750
screen you'll see what's called the chat

54
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:43,310
box and you can type in that long white

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,319
box and then either hit the little

56
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,490
dialogue icon or hit enter and it will

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,769
be posted to everyone who's

58
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,500
participating up on the top of your

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,420
screen you see a little icon of a person

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,209
with their hand raised several options

61
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,889
under that drop-down menu you could

62
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,840
agree or disagree with a comment that

63
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:03,989
the speaker is making you can ask them

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,650
to speak louder or softer to slow up or

65
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:11,040
go faster if they say something funny

66
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:16,550
you can pick the smiley face for

67
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:19,729
laughter and clapping hands for applause

68
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,620
all right I believe we're ready to begin

69
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:25,819
our first speaker today is dr. James

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,469
lamantia Jim is a plant pathologist

71
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,879
nematology and the chief scientist at

72
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,489
the connecticut Agricultural Experiment

73
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,069
Station Valley laboratory in Windsor

74
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,200
Connecticut Jim earned his BS in biology

75
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,319
from Fitchburg State College in

76
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,539
Massachusetts and ms and PhD degrees in

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,939
plant pinol plant pathology from Cornell

78
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,798
University his research interests are

79
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,949
biology and control of plant diseases

80
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,319
caused by nematodes and fungi areas of

81
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,030
emphasis include non-chemical controls

82
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,709
such as plant resistance and cropping

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,030
systems jim has 25 years of experience

84
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,409
researching strawberry diseases we're

85
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,159
very fortunate to have a gym with us

86
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:08,780
today

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:11,659
Jim hi good afternoon everybody can you

88
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,669
hear me Kathy yes okay and we'll get

89
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,879
started so what I'm going to talk about

90
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:21,019
are these nematodes and root rots that

91
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,668
occur on strawberries often strawberry

92
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,699
root diseases whether they're nematodes

93
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:27,859
or fungi or anything else that we sort

94
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,599
of come at this because the plants are

95
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,069
doing poorly or they're dying and we

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,460
really don't see anything visible on the

97
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:36,110
foliage so what we need to find out is

98
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:40,819
what are the problems and then how do we

99
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,259
deal with them so what I'm going to do

100
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,599
is talk about some of these root rots

101
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,370
and then talk about nematodes and then

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,070
talk about black root rot where it's a

103
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,660
combination of nematodes in and fungi

104
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:54,769
and just then how we can try to deal

105
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,169
with some of these things most common

106
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,839
ones are probably red steel pythium and

107
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:03,259
black root rot and I'll go through those

108
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,000
sort of in order here in addition we

109
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,589
have lesion nematodes and root-knot

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,689
nematodes is the root not on

111
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:12,589
strawberries particularly in the

112
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,569
Northeast and in Canada temperate areas

113
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:16,879
or maleta kind appli and I'll talk about

114
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,728
that as well and then because disease

115
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,319
really doesn't occur on its own in a

116
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,418
vacuum we have to consider the

117
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,639
environmental effects of this the

118
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,430
stresses to the plants that can increase

119
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,639
disease such as compaction too much or

120
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,550
too little water stressful ph's and then

121
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,379
nutrient too much or too little and

122
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,540
again that all kind of comes into this

123
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,709
disease triangle whenever a plant

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,600
pathologist gives a talk right we're

125
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,310
required to give to show the slide I

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,669
think we have to have a susceptible

127
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,709
plant rather than a resistant type a

128
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,000
causal agent which is the pathogen that

129
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:53,000
we're trying to deal with and it may be

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,038
multiple disease always doesn't occur on

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,509
a you know pure cultures and then the

132
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:01,159
environment that the plant and the

133
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:03,529
pathogen are interacting in so go to the

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,229
first disease red steel the symptoms of

135
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,389
this and the symptoms of most of these

136
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:10,370
root diseases as I said before just sort

137
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,800
of poor vigor the tops are dying back

138
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,490
stunting the plants are under stress and

139
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,220
having problems and diagnosis is a

140
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:23,360
thing we need to do so under cool

141
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,949
conditions when you when you dig these

142
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,900
plants up and look at them you can find

143
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,900
red vascular tissue which is where the

144
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:32,060
common name red steel comes from you

145
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,888
don't always see this and if it's late a

146
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,370
little later in the summer about harvest

147
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:40,009
time as its warming often that symptom

148
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,550
disappears and you just see a sort of a

149
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,259
rat tail root rot symptom and that the

150
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,020
pathogen is persistent in the soil for

151
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:50,930
years now under the right conditions you

152
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,848
can see the this reddish vascular tissue

153
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,680
and just sort of peel this back with

154
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:57,889
your thumbnail or sometimes with a knife

155
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,319
and you can notice that the cortex here

156
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,759
is nice and white the vascular tissues

157
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,199
where the disease is occurring and it's

158
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:11,900
and it's dying now and the in the bottom

159
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:14,240
left here you can see this Oh sport and

160
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,008
this is the reason why this pathogen can

161
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,509
be persistent in the soil for years and

162
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,020
years even in the absence of a host

163
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,490
these are thick walled resting spores

164
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,579
this is a water mold that produces these

165
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,918
all sports it's a sexually produced

166
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,959
spore and they can persist under tough

167
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,399
conditions for a long period of time so

168
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,189
once its present in the field you can

169
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,288
count on it almost always being there

170
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,968
now water mols produce multiple kinds of

171
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,279
spores they produce those resting spores

172
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:43,098
that's the long-term type of spore they

173
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,899
also produce sporangia which can act as

174
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:49,550
a let me show you right here in the

175
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:51,859
middle this is this brand you hear this

176
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,689
is sort of a lemon shaped spore that can

177
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,038
act at almost like a seed you can

178
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:01,339
germinate directly under under

179
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,019
conditions where its water is there's a

180
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,089
excess of water the soil pores are

181
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,769
flooded they often read if ur n she ate

182
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:08,269
and produce those spores and you can see

183
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,008
that I have the little black arrows here

184
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:13,459
as well pointing it so those pores and

185
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,538
if you look at the use your imagination

186
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,430
here you can imagine that there are

187
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:18,050
multiples though lots of results for

188
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,750
swimming around in this now these

189
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,569
actually have flagella and they can swim

190
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,418
and they chemically are attracted to

191
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:29,300
strawberry roots so that you can imagine

192
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,269
under under wet conditions flooded

193
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,740
conditions

194
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,750
of a single spring gym that's

195
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,820
germinating and causing disease you get

196
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,980
a little cluster bomb effect where now

197
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,450
you've got 20 to 40 those spores that

198
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,659
come out of this and then swim through

199
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,430
the flooded sale pores attracted to the

200
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,730
strawberry Bruce so that's one of the

201
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:50,870
reasons why flooded conditions are so

202
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,420
damaging for for this particular disease

203
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,310
as I said it's a water mold severe under

204
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,689
wet conditions so some of the things we

205
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:00,779
can do about this are to improve

206
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,090
drainage grow plants on raised beds tile

207
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,519
fields do whatever needs to be done

208
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:09,200
avoid compaction and plow pans which can

209
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,220
also increase flooding in the root zone

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,750
resistant cultivars there are a number

211
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,940
of different cultivars I've listed a few

212
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,259
here if you go to the Cornell

213
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,310
information there's a lot of different

214
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,220
places we can look at different

215
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:23,069
varieties and varieties will have some

216
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,310
level resistance to phytophthora for

217
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,860
Gary in addition some of the fungicides

218
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:30,539
may help reduce disease in combination

219
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,850
with resistance or environmental changes

220
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,610
it's difficult to rely only on

221
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,899
fungicides alone some of the fungicides

222
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,580
are aliette type riddim ill and then the

223
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,579
phosphorous acid phosphate

224
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:50,490
another water mold that can attack the

225
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,919
roots is the Pythian root rot this is

226
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,330
one that occurs a lot of different

227
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,219
places a lot of different species

228
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,320
probably that even attack strawberries

229
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,379
it's common in vegetables it's common in

230
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,240
in many soils all over all over the

231
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,689
North America and what you can see here

232
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,110
are these large numbers of these old

233
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,210
sports again in the roots now the

234
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,180
symptoms of pythium root rot are sort of

235
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,550
a watery rot of the of the route they

236
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,039
tend not to be as dramatic as the

237
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:22,889
phytophthora part of me as the proper

238
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,000
for gary or even as a black route right

239
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,949
which we'll talk about in a little bit

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,450
they tend to be more root nibblers they

241
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,340
take out the fine feeder roots and again

242
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:36,480
under cool wet conditions stressed

243
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,490
plants so some of the same management

244
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,700
tactics that you can use for fight after

245
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,039
for Gary also apply to pythium improving

246
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,020
drainage reducing compaction growing on

247
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,509
beds that sort of thing and then some of

248
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,889
the same fungicides may be helpful now

249
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:54,470
a little bit about some of the nematodes

250
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:56,750
some of these and Emma totems on

251
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,720
strawberries I think are often under

252
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,840
recognized the northern route not

253
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,450
nematode milega appli is more common I

254
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,580
think then people realize it causes

255
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,970
galls on roots but these Gauls sometimes

256
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,370
are fairly short-lived you can see here

257
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,800
these are actually clusters of multiple

258
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,169
calls if this area here has probably

259
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,000
five or six different calls there's an

260
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,579
area here if you look at this larger

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,860
area from in this sort of quadrant here

262
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,920
there's probably 25 galls in this

263
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,919
cluster of the route they also cause

264
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,990
routes to be the branch more commonly

265
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,209
than they would normally do and so we

266
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,250
get these hairy root symptoms now the

267
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,230
Gauls for northern route not nematode

268
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,330
are much smaller than those that you see

269
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,580
in the books for the southern route knot

270
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,139
nematodes you see the large galls and

271
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,120
you know pictures on tomatoes at all

272
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:49,069
these tend to be fairly small and

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,259
because strawberry roots can be a little

274
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,270
woodier they're even smaller on

275
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:56,899
strawberry not as obvious as they are on

276
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:59,840
some other crops now Emma toads are

277
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,549
plant parasitic roundworms there's

278
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,019
number of different kinds of northern

279
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:05,269
route and I nematode is one that is

280
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,870
called an endoparasites sedentary endo

281
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:13,610
parasite they are there are eggs see

282
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:16,279
here that that develop at the pointer

283
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,800
out it developed into juveniles that

284
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,199
juveniles go into the group they cause

285
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,969
the route to establish feeding cells

286
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,430
which actives transfer so so that

287
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,470
they're the same kind of cells that pump

288
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:29,209
nutrients into fruit except in this case

289
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,580
they're taking the nutrients and giving

290
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,620
it to the nematode upon which you know

291
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,210
it feeds and as a result they increase

292
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,269
in size fairly dramatically this would

293
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,250
be a juvenile here and they increase in

294
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,870
size to these large females which are

295
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,519
essentially egg-laying machines they go

296
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,409
through several moles and then the

297
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,000
females produce an egg mass that's about

298
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:52,100
the same size as the female so they're

299
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,980
very feet kind they tend to infect hit

300
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,230
the root tips so you can see multiple

301
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,170
juvenile stained red here in the root

302
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,940
tip on the inset then the root tip

303
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:03,889
itself tends to stop growing gets

304
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,259
swollen and as a result of that you

305
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,448
often get

306
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,239
branching so you get these little areas

307
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:11,008
where you get Vera stems being produced

308
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:16,019
in branch and coming out hence the hairy

309
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:18,479
root symptom over time as the root

310
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,339
continues to continues to grow you can

311
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:23,429
get multiple females being produced it

312
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,619
from that which was once was the root

313
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,600
tip so you have the female actually

314
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:30,119
inside the root here another one over

315
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,579
here and then two more on this side now

316
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,678
this area is the egg mass that's being

317
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,358
produced so when you look again at the

318
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:39,600
inset here you have this white creamy

319
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:42,149
colored female this is the head end down

320
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,359
here at the very top and then underneath

321
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:48,989
is the egg mass again this is a several

322
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:50,699
hundred eggs which you think about this

323
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:55,769
she's producing more eggs than than her

324
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:58,409
own body mass so I mentioned happeh

325
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,688
tends to be more common than we realize

326
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:04,108
it infects a lot of agronomic crops

327
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:06,808
almost all vegetables small fruit things

328
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,910
like soybean clover a lot of broadleaf

329
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:12,298
weeds some of the more common ones of

330
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:14,969
the purslane plantain dandelion you can

331
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:16,769
read here however all grain crops are

332
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,269
non host from Oregon happeh so that

333
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,989
gives us an idea of what we can do for

334
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:26,548
rotation possibility there is two to

335
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:29,339
rotate with a grain crop now one of the

336
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:32,308
things when we try to get rid of of

337
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,449
these nematodes with grain crops is it's

338
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,368
often difficult to get all the

339
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:40,229
strawberry crowns out of the field or

340
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:42,989
the broadleaf weeds and if those hosts

341
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,668
of the nematode continue to survive in

342
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:45,869
the field they will be a source of

343
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:48,178
inoculum and again these nematodes

344
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:50,999
increase so quickly because they produce

345
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:53,100
so many eggs that it can be difficult if

346
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,859
you don't get these out to control by

347
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,298
rotation and then finally fumigation but

348
00:14:55,859 --> 00:15:00,299
that's getting to be tougher and tougher

349
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:04,139
to do as more regulations come in and

350
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:06,269
make it harder to fumigate lesion

351
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,188
nematode is very common it's probably

352
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,959
the most common nematode in the

353
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:12,418
northeastern Canada Prada Lanka's

354
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,138
penetrance ism one we see the most this

355
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:18,088
is a a verme reform nematode it so it's

356
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,649
a migratory indo para cited

357
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,079
does not produce the feem the large

358
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,698
females like the root not does these go

359
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,409
into the roots migrate through the

360
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,120
cortex and cause lesions like you can

361
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,620
see here now this happens to be a

362
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,328
soybean root and you can see these

363
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,789
chocolate brown lesions where the

364
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:35,058
nematode has moved through soybean is

365
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,230
actually a pretty good indicator of

366
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:39,438
nematode infection in the field and we

367
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,120
can use this for a bioassay an effect

368
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:46,139
worked at the Georgia ballet at Cornell

369
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,688
was done is using a using these as a way

370
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,850
for growers to evaluate the level of

371
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:53,129
lesion nematodes in their field and that

372
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,028
may be something we can talk about in

373
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:59,579
the future sometime now these nematodes

374
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:01,019
also go inside the route they migrate

375
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:03,508
through the cortex and you can see the

376
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,850
the juveniles and the adults stained red

377
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:08,100
here you can also see the eggs that they

378
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,720
lay as they move along they don't

379
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,629
produce egg masses they just lay them as

380
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,329
they go in the roots or in the soil and

381
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:17,100
as they move they cause damage they're

382
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,948
feeding on the cell contents and moving

383
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,028
through the cells these nematodes as I

384
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:27,479
mentioned are very common in our area

385
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:28,828
they can attack almost almost every

386
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,829
plane you can think of ins in many

387
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:33,208
respects over 550 species of agronomic

388
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,549
crops and weeds and there's probably

389
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,919
more that we haven't looked at yet now

390
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:40,498
the grain crops that you're growing for

391
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,278
control mode again appli are almost all

392
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:46,740
hosts or I don't like its penetrance so

393
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,178
if you're you do need to know what the

394
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,370
nematode problem is before you try to

395
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:54,389
control it by rotation so we want to

396
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,428
talk a little bit about what these

397
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,350
nematodes do in terms of other than

398
00:16:56,428 --> 00:17:01,558
direct damage they are involved in

399
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,399
another root rot disease called black

400
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:09,058
root rot this is one that has a complex

401
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:11,788
cause multiple organisms for us the most

402
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,849
common one is the fungal problem that

403
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:17,038
causes the root riders is by nucleate

404
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,778
rhizoctonia rhizoctonia for gary very

405
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,980
common in strawberries its associated

406
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:24,869
with a secure part me a cortical root

407
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,699
rot I'll show you some pictures of that

408
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,529
in a second here and then the lesion

409
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,019
nematodes and stress also increased

410
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,839
disease now again the symptoms of this

411
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,058
are pretty

412
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,399
on the script and hence the common name

413
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:38,710
the plants are dying they decline over

414
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,390
time the longer you have a field in

415
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,548
production and strawberries the more

416
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,480
likely it is to be a problem with a

417
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:45,480
black root rot

418
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,320
be clicking to hear at a time and when

419
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,470
you dig these plants up you can see the

420
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:59,009
plant on the left has this has root rot

421
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,710
you'll see you know black roots actually

422
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:04,140
fewer roots as well compared to the

423
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:08,130
healthy plant on the right or healthier

424
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,140
plant on the right so when you look at

425
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,550
those look more closely at those at

426
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,130
those roots you can see that there's a

427
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,740
cortical root rot so the pathogen is

428
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,870
causing the the cortex to die and if you

429
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,759
slice that open you can differentiate

430
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:24,029
between this and a disease like red

431
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:27,140
steel because now the the cortex is

432
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:29,549
dying and turning black and rotting

433
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,490
coming just away sometimes again with a

434
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,169
similar rat tail pipe of symptom but

435
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,880
when you look at the vascular tissue it

436
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,070
remains white for a period of time now

437
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,960
eventually that's all going to die in

438
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:44,909
the in the plant just the roots just rot

439
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,130
away and disappear turn mushy as I

440
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,890
mentioned the pathogen that causes the

441
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:53,940
root rot symptom is this rhizoctonia for

442
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:58,110
Gary very similar to the rise akhon

443
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:00,269
vegetables but again to buy nucleate

444
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:02,789
rather than multinucleate and there are

445
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:05,190
different anastomosis groups and you see

446
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:07,079
I have a chart here of what what happens

447
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,390
when we come we did experiments in

448
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,569
growth chambers looking at different

449
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,550
isolates of the pathogenic fungus

450
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:18,750
rhizoctonia and the year anastomosis

451
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,639
groups AG and I these tend to differ a

452
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,640
little bit and they're pathogenicity and

453
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,830
how they do at certain temperatures and

454
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,410
you can see there's no no scale here but

455
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:30,419
there's the three boxes across the front

456
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,660
are where we have just the right sock

457
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:37,620
Tony alone with no nematodes the zero

458
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,769
here or with a low level and this is

459
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,179
under these conditions we're getting

460
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,240
twenty-five thirty forty percent root

461
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,430
rot or a higher level on these are what

462
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,289
we would consider to be damaging levels

463
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,509
of lesion nematodes that kindly see

464
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,529
mostly in the populations that we would

465
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:55,410
see in the field that are causing

466
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:58,109
stunting so you're right goes from

467
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,180
thirty to thirty-five percent here to

468
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:01,089
about seventy to eighty percent when we

469
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,490
add the police

470
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:05,049
nematodes as well so they do interact

471
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,220
and increase the amount of disease

472
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:10,539
caused by the right effect onium so what

473
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,059
are the effects that we're seeing we did

474
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,639
other experiments here again no

475
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:19,359
pathogens none the rise like Tony are

476
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:22,090
for Gary alone or the rhizoctonia plus

477
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,689
Prada Lanka's penetrance the pp you can

478
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:27,759
see again blackroot right increases even

479
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,850
ten percent with none there probably is

480
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,200
some rhizoctonia and the nuns it's

481
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:34,449
sometimes difficult to get strawberries

482
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,029
with absolutely no resurrect Tony for

483
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,610
Gary but where we have the pathogen

484
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,339
where we have inoculated we get 22% root

485
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,049
rot more than double it when we have the

486
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:48,220
resurrect onia in combination with the

487
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:49,659
the nematode now in addition to visible

488
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,110
disease that we're seeing on the roots

489
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,050
we see reduced length both in structural

490
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:57,969
roots and in feeder roots so the roots

491
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,149
that are rotting tend to disappear and

492
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:03,730
we have a smaller root system and over

493
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:07,090
time it's smaller root system not not so

494
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:11,910
healthy root system results in a decline

495
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:14,559
in this this is a lack of vigor and and

496
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:17,800
debilitating decline in the strawberries

497
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,419
over over time now to talk about the

498
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,000
route route I think we also need to talk

499
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,279
about what route types we're talking

500
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,079
about with strawberry here I'm going to

501
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,019
talk about structural routes these have

502
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,659
both primary and secondary tissues with

503
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,940
a well-developed cortex the structural

504
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,590
roots are the roots that you get when

505
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,150
the larger roots that you get with it

506
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:40,359
with a transplant those the ones that

507
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,690
are going into the ground we also have

508
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:46,029
perennial groups healthy plants that are

509
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,549
a couple of years old have very woody

510
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,170
roots these are primarily there's mostly

511
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,539
secondary tissues these are woody

512
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,519
tissues there is no real cortex it's

513
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,170
gone it's been slept off and they have

514
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,240
feeder roots and come off these so both

515
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:02,380
structure groups and Prairie roots have

516
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:07,089
these soft primary tissue by primary I

517
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,260
mean non-woody tissues that are thus

518
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,240
feeder roots and these are pretty

519
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,190
short-lived and in the literature they

520
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,410
talk about some of the feeder roots

521
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:18,150
cycling through about every

522
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:21,550
two weeks or so which seems very quickly

523
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:24,580
having trouble here moving one at a time

524
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:28,089
but these are the structure roots you

525
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:31,240
can see that they are these white

526
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:34,379
tissues here and they also have the

527
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,380
feeder roots coming off them

528
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,360
we do a cross section of this you can

529
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:46,339
see that we have a route with the

530
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,139
vascular tissue I root cortex and then

531
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:50,419
the epidermis on the outside so this is

532
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,100
the cross section of the of the feeder

533
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,740
roots apartment these structural roots

534
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:57,949
now those structure votes over time

535
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,750
produce the secondary woody tissue so we

536
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,759
have vascular tissue on the inside and

537
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,240
you can see what this black arrow is

538
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,950
we're getting secondary growth on the

539
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,720
inside of this is woody tissue in the

540
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,440
cortex is to the left of to the outside

541
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,380
of this now over time those roots will

542
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,200
develop into these perennial roots here

543
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,390
these are dark many cases they're black

544
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,100
roots often people think they're dead

545
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,990
but if you slice those open they're

546
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,149
they're nice and white inside and they

547
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,680
have functional feeder roots so and when

548
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,910
they are healthy they will continue to

549
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,350
to be valuable to the plant now if we

550
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,519
take those printery roots and cut them

551
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:37,399
open you can see it's almost like

552
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,259
cutting open a tree trunk you a very

553
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,750
woody tissue we've got the vascular

554
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,700
tissue design them in here and this

555
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,930
black area on the outside is what used

556
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,309
to be the cortex so as though that that

557
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,370
secondary tissue grows from the inside

558
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,169
out it cuts off the cortex and that it

559
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:56,389
essentially dies and it's left off and

560
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,060
becomes this black outside the perennial

561
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,560
roots and then the feeder roots that

562
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,460
occur on both these are very soft

563
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,460
tissues no woody growth in them at all

564
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,079
the roots cycle over time we get an

565
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:14,750
increase in roots to about the time the

566
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,309
plants fruit they tend to go down over

567
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,750
time probably as a result of disease and

568
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:22,279
then come back again in the fall and if

569
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,039
we further split that up you can see the

570
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,859
the the green areas here are the you

571
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:31,519
white structural roots again go down

572
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:33,619
during fruiting and then if they remain

573
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,750
healthy will turn into the black

574
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:38,119
perennial roots with the yellow circles

575
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,210
and increase over time again in the fall

576
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:44,179
as well as the way structured what's

577
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,160
coming back again in the fall now what

578
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,019
are the nematodes do so they get in they

579
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,670
cause these lesions they cause cell

580
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,940
death that caused the collapse which

581
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:54,680
causes that in a chaotic spot you can

582
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,820
see there are areas here where Demi

583
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,799
toads have moved right through the

584
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:59,919
cortex they they move through the cells

585
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,480
feeding on the contents those cells die

586
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,130
you can see the phenolic sand the

587
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,980
discoloration that occurs around them

588
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,570
and in those cells over time that leads

589
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,519
to this lesion where you get multiple

590
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:13,849
cell depth nematodes are probably move

591
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:15,619
through these cells here and then around

592
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:17,689
this though that tissue dies and then

593
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:21,699
seemingly the right attorney moves into

594
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,380
this now in addition to directly

595
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,390
damaging cells in the literature and

596
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,610
we've also seen we get discoloration of

597
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,670
the endodermis is this ring that occurs

598
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:32,869
around the vascular tissue that this is

599
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,170
where the secondary growth starts

600
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:38,419
becomes discolored it starts to be again

601
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,950
like it was cut open like the phenolic

602
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,340
seeeeee can we get early secondary

603
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,640
growth so the plants recognize it to

604
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:48,500
being damaged and they produce perennial

605
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,190
roots or on the least part of that root

606
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:55,099
system faster now so what are the

607
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:58,279
nematodes in the in the root system very

608
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:00,529
few are in the perennial roots that not

609
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:03,170
surprising these are obligate parasites

610
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,639
they need living tissue on which to feed

611
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,620
those woody roots are tough for them to

612
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,180
get into if they do occur in perennial

613
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,579
roots it's probably in the feeder roots

614
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,980
that are associated with those there

615
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:15,289
they can be higher a number in the

616
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,720
structural and then very common in the

617
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,059
feeder roots very few are in the soil if

618
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,140
we have decent roots most of those

619
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,579
nematodes are not going to be in

620
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,650
soil at all they're going to be in the

621
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:27,019
structure roots are the feeder roots so

622
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,730
that tells us what kind of roots we

623
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,500
should be taking it for doing sampling

624
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,460
to determine if we have nematodes in the

625
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,170
field and now when do we sample how that

626
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,660
again I mentioned these are obligate

627
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,880
parasites they need root issue on which

628
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,620
to feed you think about what happens to

629
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,810
the root issue over time it peaks in

630
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:48,169
late May or so and then starts to

631
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:51,980
decline the nematode populations do the

632
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,420
same thing they mirror roots as the

633
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,900
roots are declining and dying the

634
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,340
nematodes either population crashes or

635
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,950
they move off into the soil and become

636
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:03,379
tougher to to get back out so that the

637
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,759
peaks are just before harvest so that

638
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,890
tells us not only where do we need to

639
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:11,269
sample the feeder roots in the structure

640
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:13,070
rules but when late May so ransacked

641
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,400
onia this is the one the organism that

642
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:18,649
causes black gujrat gets into the cortex

643
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,170
digest that tissue you can see the

644
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,170
manila lloyd cells here in the

645
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:29,470
in the cortex these are these are the

646
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:32,949
this is the organism that causes the

647
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:37,210
actual rot so where where does this

648
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:40,690
occur primarily in the in the perennial

649
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,829
roots the Nets left cortex i believe so

650
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,850
if we look at this and either in the

651
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:49,389
spring or again after harvest late june

652
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:51,009
or so in the spring most of the rise

653
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,750
like Tony that we isolated and we took a

654
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,429
tire root systems and cut them up into

655
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,720
little two millimeter root sections and

656
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:58,360
plated these all out and counted the

657
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,429
percent infection more than half of the

658
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,579
perennial roots were infected with

659
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:06,038
rhizoctonia for Gary initially very

660
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,839
little in the structural roots feeder

661
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:11,259
roots or even in what seemed to be

662
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:13,629
lesion nematode areas now I ask those

663
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:17,648
plants go through harvest they're

664
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:20,230
stressed the Incan level of infection at

665
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:22,449
Prairie roots goes very high as do the

666
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,860
level of infection where lesion

667
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,450
nematodes are present so we wanted to

668
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,819
look at what's going on here we actually

669
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,340
did some experiments where we did split

670
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:35,019
roots we took a straw took strawberry

671
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:36,970
crowns and split the root system in two

672
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:39,129
so that we had half the root system in

673
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,649
part one half in the second pot and then

674
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:45,929
inoculated either with both pathogens

675
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:51,099
and in different pots both in the same

676
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:53,759
pot here or only the nematodes or only

677
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,759
the fungus

678
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,550
so just give you a visual roots on

679
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:06,000
either side either had the pathogens

680
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:07,769
together or separately now what happened

681
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,500
for disease where we had the most

682
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:12,690
disease was where we had both pathogens

683
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,920
in the same pot when both pathogens were

684
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,960
present at the same level but in

685
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,850
different sides of the root system we

686
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,920
did not have as much disease and it was

687
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,319
actually the same as if we had only one

688
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,289
or the other so it seems as though it is

689
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:30,329
not a systemic effect but a localized

690
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:32,399
effect so what happens here I believe

691
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:34,199
that the rhizoctonia for Gary seems to

692
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,580
be resident on strawberry roots we've

693
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,750
done a lot of sampling and a lot of

694
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:41,939
strawberries over many years it's very

695
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,819
common on the root system doesn't always

696
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,620
close disease so we can find plants that

697
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:50,189
are healthy they will have rhizoctonia

698
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,319
on them mostly on the surface primarily

699
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:55,230
again on the perennial roots but not

700
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,359
necessarily causing disease when we see

701
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,789
secondary growth starting in the cortex

702
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,089
dying we get increased rhizoctonia

703
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,430
infection when we see nematode lesions

704
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:06,750
we get increased rhizoctonia infection

705
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,220
and I think the same is true with

706
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,569
environmental stress it's been a lot of

707
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,690
cases where environmental stress

708
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:16,950
increases blackroot run so again good

709
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,539
stress problems with the roots so what

710
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:21,150
are the lesion nematodes doing they

711
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:25,049
cause this root damage directly by their

712
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,550
feeding that results in wounded tissue

713
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:29,430
there's probably more susceptible to the

714
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:32,129
riot act onia it also results in roots

715
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,769
producing early secondary growth so we

716
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,310
have areas limited areas in the root

717
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:39,900
system where the secondary growth occurs

718
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,519
those those parts of the cortex are

719
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,780
being cut off and within there soon

720
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,200
essing and I think that's where the

721
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:47,849
rhizoctonia moves in first the areas of

722
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,730
the route that have these dis dying

723
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:52,199
cortex that's the start and it moves

724
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,950
from there into the what would otherwise

725
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,950
be healthy

726
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:02,179
so lesion nematodes how common are these

727
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:05,570
we actually did a survey in Connecticut

728
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:06,860
and a few years ago put this out

729
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,119
twenty-five percent of the growers

730
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,028
thought that they had damaging

731
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,928
populations of lesion nematodes of that

732
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:16,099
most of those either fumigated used a

733
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:19,240
matte aside like Nemec you're afeared

734
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:23,839
and which was labeled at the time or

735
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,038
sometimes did both so the other 75%

736
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,369
either didn't think they had a problem

737
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:31,038
or were unaware that they had a problem

738
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:33,168
or said what's a lesion nematode now

739
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,429
lesion nematodes we might actually went

740
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:37,460
out and surveyed those fields after we

741
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:40,309
did this in the analysis of asking the

742
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,769
growers you found them in 31 of the 41

743
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:46,490
fields we looked at for the growers that

744
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:49,669
had no problems three of those fumigated

745
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:54,380
with methyl bromide in or and or teal

746
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:56,360
own so surprised that they they actually

747
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,110
thought they had damaging problems may

748
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:02,209
be had in the past but for those fields

749
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:05,028
three of the fields didn't have any

750
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,980
nematodes at all the growers that were

751
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:09,619
aware of the problem and others that

752
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,058
were even unaware three other word

753
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:13,459
thought they had problems in eight that

754
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:16,460
were unaware that didn't manage all had

755
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,110
damaging lesion nematode populations so

756
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,750
they're much more common than people

757
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:23,808
realized they didn't recognize the

758
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,609
problem i will begin not surprising

759
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,519
because there are no obvious symptoms

760
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:30,678
other than lesions which can be tough to

761
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,509
see now one of the things we found in

762
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,759
our surveys is the people who rotated

763
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:36,919
often with small grains this did not

764
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,509
affect the lesion amitha populations

765
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,990
actually made it some cases probably

766
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:44,298
worse so what are the impacts of

767
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,548
nematodes we had done some work looking

768
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:50,418
at what nematodes do to reduce yields

769
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:52,308
and found that if we adapted a model

770
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:54,710
developed a Cornell by demory and

771
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:58,129
reichenberg if there are no nematodes

772
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,778
this is 98 numbers there was a profit of

773
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,450
nearly eight thousand dollars per acre

774
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,798
over four years when we start getting up

775
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,000
into damaging levels which would be

776
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,069
somewhere where we consider about a

777
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,349
hundred nematodes for grammar root is

778
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:13,668
damaging you can see we got a really

779
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:15,048
get lost in profitability and we start

780
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:18,320
getting above damaging levels we

781
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:19,819
actually had a predicta loss over four

782
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,000
years so this is not something that

783
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:25,970
anybody wants to deal with so how do we

784
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,669
manage black root rot in the past it had

785
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:32,870
been done with fumigation broad-spectrum

786
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:35,990
fumigants melfa bromide or lacks things

787
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:38,859
like that again that becomes is becoming

788
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:41,000
more difficult or impossible to do

789
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,918
you'll see a lot a lot of times in

790
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,269
recommendations to use rotation but the

791
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,370
question is with what and for how long

792
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:51,379
sanitation planting clean crowns we did

793
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:53,719
some work with fertilizers and ammonia

794
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,460
was better than nitrate fertilizers but

795
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,200
give us about ten percent reduction and

796
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,200
then control of lesion nematodes

797
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:04,509
we also try to do some work with

798
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,360
fungicides seeing if we could use a dip

799
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:09,250
or drench again rhizoctonia for gary is

800
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,378
pretty common it can even be found in

801
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,219
healthy crowns from nurseries so we

802
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:14,860
thought if we could break that

803
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:16,480
association that would help did a bunch

804
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,700
look at a number of different fungicides

805
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,030
and then isolated from the root system

806
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:25,230
we also evaluated on on auger plates to

807
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,510
see if we saw inhibition in media

808
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:31,449
department we found the sum head

809
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,960
activity some in vitro meaning in the

810
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,730
plates some on the plants but at this

811
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,559
point this is work that more work needs

812
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,510
to be done to find out what we might be

813
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,860
able to use it be more effective and

814
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,740
some of the newer fungicides we need to

815
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,450
test again I'm sure rich will talk a

816
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,219
little more about this but we've been

817
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:51,398
working on resistance or tolerance to

818
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:53,109
black root rot that's one possibility

819
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:55,480
and there are some varieties that seem

820
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,519
to be more affected than others and

821
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,030
again I think he will speak to this a

822
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:03,309
little bit finally a cover crop so you

823
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,140
know what do we grow and for how long we

824
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:08,529
look here this is a graph of

825
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:09,940
reproductive factor final population

826
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,460
over the initial so it's essentially an

827
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,889
increase how much does it multiplied

828
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,360
over time hairy vetch increases by seven

829
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:18,969
times so if we start off with a hundred

830
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,320
nematodes probably end up with 700 over

831
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:25,629
one season mustard it actually increases

832
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,180
rapeseed two and a half times start

833
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,920
getting down into a sorghum Sudan graphs

834
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:34,199
like Troodon eight and down into

835
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,400
ryegrass we get less of an increase now

836
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,509
not only do we have to just grow these

837
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,160
plants but if you can grow them is

838
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,290
agreement or and incorporate and some of

839
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,929
these plants produce chemicals which can

840
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:46,239
be toxic to them at those a little

841
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:47,829
pathak if you will so hairy vetch

842
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,469
obviously doesn't have these properties

843
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:54,099
the properties is a great host for for

844
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:55,299
lesion nematodes as is alfalfa some of

845
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:58,059
the grains but when you start getting

846
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,070
down to the Sioux Texas agro Sudan grass

847
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,690
the rapeseed rye grass and mustard you

848
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,180
can see that the populations are not as

849
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,409
high so you get a bio fumigation or

850
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:08,298
allelopathically

851
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:10,460
now in addition we've been working on

852
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:13,038
there's a Canadian forged pearl millet

853
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,500
we get a we did some work here at the

854
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,900
valley laboratory looking at buckwheat

855
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,179
dwarf Essex brassica which is one that

856
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,548
was a high glucosinolate used for bio

857
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:25,250
fumigation velvet bean was used down

858
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:26,929
south and then circle sudan grass and

859
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,659
again this canadian forged pearl millet

860
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:31,578
and what we found was that the sudan

861
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:33,798
grass and the and the millet actually

862
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,900
had the best efficacy for green manures

863
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:38,509
much better even than the dwarf essex

864
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,880
brassica which supposedly is a bio

865
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,619
fumigant but unfortunately it's also a

866
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,230
host of the nematode so that it can

867
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:47,619
increase it in the root system and then

868
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,480
when you chop it down and turn it under

869
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:54,200
and you're trying to knock down a

870
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,530
population you just increased so

871
00:36:54,199 --> 00:37:02,029
that I think I will stop and a Kathy do

872
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:04,280
we have any time for questions yes we

873
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,320
have time for a couple rich is asking

874
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,930
Jim that you would explain a nasty

875
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,320
mostest group to the to the folks okay

876
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:14,629
well Ryback Tony ax has these different

877
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,849
anastomosis groups these are anastomosis

878
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:22,130
is fusion so these are these are wide

879
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,900
groups that are that are very similar so

880
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:26,030
that essentially what the rhizoctonia

881
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,210
does is it recognizes other isolates as

882
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:32,780
itself and it will will fuse hyphy and

883
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,699
exchange genetic information so if if

884
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,530
you have very similar isolates they are

885
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:40,069
in the same anastomosis group these

886
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,780
hyphy fuse if they are different enough

887
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,369
that they no longer recognize each other

888
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,250
they're in a different anastomosis group

889
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:48,608
so that's one way of saying related

890
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,608
strains

891
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,019
ok other other questions for Jim

892
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:04,400
okay when I use the term radish is that

893
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,400
oil seed radish yes we have been doing

894
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,139
some work with oil seed radish that's we

895
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:16,849
doing this in micro plots that's in

896
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:20,319
under way and I can't really speak as to

897
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,319
how well that's working yet

898
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,579
other questions

899
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:30,230
thanks Jim and you can think about

900
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:33,259
questions for Jim he'll be back with us

901
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:36,559
at the end of the program our next

902
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,660
speaker is dr. Richard cowles rich

903
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,409
obtained his degrees in entomology from

904
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:43,730
Cornell and Michigan State University

905
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:45,259
after completion of his doctoral degree

906
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,690
he worked for four years as statewide

907
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,310
extension and researched turf and

908
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:53,240
ornamental specialist at the University

909
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:55,009
of California Riverside since 1994 rich

910
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,598
has spent a research entomologist at the

911
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,849
Connecticut agricultural experiment

912
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,250
station and is also stationed at the

913
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,990
valley laboratory in Windsor his areas

914
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,159
of study include managing pyrethroid

915
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:08,959
resistance use of systemic insecticides

916
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,429
integrated pest management and breeding

917
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,329
strawberries for resistance to black

918
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:18,289
root rot and black vine weevils rich

919
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:20,680
okay I'm here let me switch to your

920
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,679
presentation

921
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:31,389
oh good afternoon everybody let's see I

922
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:34,079
just need to do a little adjustment here

923
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:34,079
first

924
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:48,989
can everybody hear me all right

925
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:06,429
all right there we go excellent a little

926
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,400
bit of an overview for my presentation

927
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:13,460
now go over the life cycle for root

928
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,670
weevils go over some field observations

929
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:20,179
for how these root weevils damage

930
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:22,639
strawberry plantings and I'll go into

931
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:28,940
some practical approaches to manage root

932
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:31,548
weevils and strawberries we have a

933
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,829
number of species of importance

934
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:36,199
throughout the United States of which

935
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:38,750
black vile evil is present across the

936
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:41,808
country along with some of the smaller

937
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,460
rule evil species the smaller the

938
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:45,260
strawberry root weevil and rough

939
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,510
strawberry rootweaver are found

940
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,569
throughout the country to black vile

941
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:56,150
evil is about half an inch long in body

942
00:40:50,568 --> 00:40:58,639
length that's a black vine weevil

943
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:03,858
whereas the strawberry root weevil

944
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:05,750
excuse me strawberry Louisville and

945
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:10,369
rough strawberry root weevil are about

946
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:13,849
half that size the leaf evil is a

947
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:16,700
brilliant green color and unlike the oh

948
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:20,450
dear Inca species which are the black

949
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:23,598
violin these other strawberry and rough

950
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:27,980
fruit strawberry root weevil the leaf

951
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,829
weevil which is bright green reproduces

952
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,990
sexually then in the Pacific Northwest

953
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:35,359
there may also be other root weevils

954
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:39,548
which thankfully we don't have in New

955
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,548
England such as a clay colored weevil

956
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,760
the life cycle of black vile evil if you

957
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,590
were to go out right now probably

958
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,770
anywhere in the country you'd find

959
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:57,789
overwintering pupae and also

960
00:41:53,769 --> 00:42:00,550
overwintering adults blank vile evil and

961
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:03,909
all of the root weevils pretty much are

962
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,920
long-lived and the adults can live for

963
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:08,440
more than one year this is of great

964
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,590
concern because sometimes those weevils

965
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,530
that are overwintering as adults may

966
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:17,350
start feeding and laying eggs far ahead

967
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:22,030
of the generation that emerges during

968
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:24,460
the summer but you should have mostly

969
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,570
overwintering pupae and when the soil

970
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:33,010
temperatures these are the pupae here

971
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:35,200
let's see okay when the soil

972
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,790
temperatures reach about 55 degrees

973
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:42,819
Fahrenheit that triggers development of

974
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:45,340
the overwintering excuse me the larvae

975
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:48,269
are over went right over here when the

976
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,519
soil temperatures reach about 55 degrees

977
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:54,070
Fahrenheit that triggers them to develop

978
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,860
to the intermediate stage to the pupae

979
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,840
where they complete development an

980
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:03,880
emergent about the time that there are

981
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:08,740
strawberries starting to ripen in the

982
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:11,230
field the adults feed extensively on the

983
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:14,469
edges of the leaves for about three to

984
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:17,650
four weeks at which time they are able

985
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:20,799
then to start laying eggs eggs are

986
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:25,050
initially white within a few days they

987
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,120
develop to this a yellowish-brown color

988
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:30,570
which indicates that there at developing

989
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:30,569
properly

990
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:40,720
this feeding along the edges of the

991
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,550
strawberry leaves is especially

992
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,589
important for it's important for a

993
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:48,670
number of reasons one of which is that

994
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:51,190
it provides a very excellent way for you

995
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:54,190
to go out and monitor in your fields to

996
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,650
determine where you have black bile evil

997
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,079
infestations or any of the other root

998
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:03,340
weevils will cause the same sort of leaf

999
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:07,509
notching the other thing of concerned

1000
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:10,750
with with the feeding activity is that

1001
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:13,090
where you have a lot of feeding that

1002
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,570
implies that the weevils will be able to

1003
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:18,789
convert that foliage into eggs and if

1004
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:23,740
you look at this particular field in

1005
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:26,650
this area right here we had fixed set

1006
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:29,799
irrigation and when the grower went

1007
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:33,970
through and renovated by mowing off the

1008
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,190
foliage in that particular field that

1009
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:39,159
was at the time when the weevils were

1010
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:41,950
just about ready to start laying eggs so

1011
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:44,170
you can imagine the season before they

1012
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:46,299
mowed the foliage they could not mow

1013
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,858
where there was this irrigation because

1014
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,000
of the risers they couldn't take the

1015
00:44:47,858 --> 00:44:55,199
mower over it and the weevils from the

1016
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,170
entire field were then concentrated

1017
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,449
right where the irrigation pipe was they

1018
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,570
continued feeding started laying their

1019
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:06,460
eggs where the foliage was still present

1020
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,039
in the field and then they moved outward

1021
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,530
from that site so in looking across the

1022
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:15,389
field I could see in the fall these rows

1023
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:19,750
of strawberries where the pipes were

1024
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:22,000
turning red and there was less damage

1025
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:25,059
but if there was a very strong gradient

1026
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,699
from that that particular row and across

1027
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:30,579
the field and then the next irrigation

1028
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:33,579
pipe would look just the same SS so

1029
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:36,250
where you have extremely tasty foliage

1030
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:38,049
available to the adults that's where

1031
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,059
they will be feeding and that's where

1032
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,220
they will be laying eggs and then

1033
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:45,750
consequently that's where root damage

1034
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:45,750
will be occurring

1035
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,529
the

1036
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:59,530
leave ma Qing within the field is a very

1037
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,380
useful measure what we did with surveys

1038
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:05,440
is that we went throughout Connecticut

1039
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:08,890
and we took samples of 100 leaves in

1040
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,429
every strawberry field that we could

1041
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:15,609
find pretty much we took the hundred

1042
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:17,949
leaf sample at random and then we sat

1043
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,870
down and we counted the percentage of

1044
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:22,719
those leaves that had any signs of

1045
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:26,409
notching which presumably would be from

1046
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:29,859
rue e-ville adult feeding and the

1047
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:32,409
numbers of fields that had a certain

1048
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:38,440
percent of leaf notching then form this

1049
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:46,000
histogram so we had a large number of

1050
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:49,750
fields with fifty percent or less

1051
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,929
notching and a few fields that were very

1052
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,460
severely affected these are ones in

1053
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:59,109
which the growers would have seen

1054
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:03,250
extreme damage although there was only

1055
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:06,660
one field out of the total of something

1056
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,659
like forty two fields or so

1057
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:16,480
that head there was only one filled out

1058
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:20,588
of the 18 in this histogram that had no

1059
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,679
signs of any leaf notching and so it

1060
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:25,210
tells me that black vile evil

1061
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,190
infestations through fields in

1062
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,769
Connecticut are widespread practically

1063
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:32,980
every field of strawberries will have

1064
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:36,009
some root weevil activity it's extremely

1065
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:39,278
rare to find any field that has no root

1066
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:42,549
weevils there are only about a quarter

1067
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:45,489
of the fields that have infestations

1068
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:48,179
have enough to require doing some sort

1069
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:48,179
of management

1070
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:59,079
and in doing our surveys we found that

1071
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,809
there were considerable variety varietal

1072
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:05,650
differences so certain varieties such as

1073
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:09,730
all star or Annapolis would be looking

1074
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:11,710
pretty good and yet laboring varieties

1075
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:16,139
such as Kent or honeoye would be

1076
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:16,139
destroyed by black vine weevil

1077
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,789
this led to rather an intensive a

1078
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:28,599
project in comparing commercial

1079
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:30,789
strawberry varieties to see on whether

1080
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:34,059
there were genetic whether there was

1081
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:40,808
genetic variation that would allow us

1082
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:43,109
then allow growers to to plant varieties

1083
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:45,640
that had some level of resistant to

1084
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:47,769
resistance to root weevils one of the

1085
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:49,629
methods that I used was to take leaf

1086
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:52,119
discs from different varieties of

1087
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,400
strawberries there's just punched out

1088
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,470
with the court bore place them in a

1089
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,530
petri dish with weevil and then allow

1090
00:48:56,469 --> 00:49:00,699
the weevils to feed overnight and some

1091
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,339
of the things that contribute to

1092
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:05,798
variation in the palatability of

1093
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:09,608
strawberries to black vine weevil are

1094
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:13,030
the degree of how many leaf hairs they

1095
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:16,259
have and there are other features of the

1096
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,970
strawberry leaves too however there are

1097
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:23,339
quite major differences among strawberry

1098
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:25,838
varieties in their palate ability to

1099
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:29,380
like vile evil and this can be an

1100
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:32,769
important thing to use for finding

1101
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:36,220
resistance another aspect that I looked

1102
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:38,259
at was to see whether the root systems

1103
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:40,598
for the strawberry varieties differed in

1104
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,950
how well they would support black vine

1105
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:46,809
weevil larval development and of the 21

1106
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:49,298
cultivars that I looked at there were no

1107
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:52,990
there was no variation the larvae

1108
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:55,809
developed equivalently on all 21

1109
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:59,098
cultivars so it's really the foliage and

1110
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:02,250
on differences that are leading to

1111
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:07,480
variations that we see in the field and

1112
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:09,519
damage that's not to say that route

1113
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,190
characteristics aren't important though

1114
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:15,429
related to survival of the strawberry

1115
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,260
plants and I think the way to look at

1116
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:20,558
this is that there are very likely

1117
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:23,589
interactions with root pathogens so if

1118
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,819
we have a cultivars that are susceptible

1119
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:30,969
to black root rot and have as a

1120
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:32,179
consequent consequence of root rot very

1121
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:35,750
few roots

1122
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:38,469
functional roots those are varieties

1123
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:41,329
then that cannot tolerate additional

1124
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:44,828
root weevil feeding on those root system

1125
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:48,920
systems the plants simply then collapse

1126
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:55,339
so if we wish to have a program in which

1127
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:57,139
we're using plant resistance we need to

1128
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:59,869
have a breeding program in which we

1129
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:02,088
jointly improve root disease and root

1130
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:04,880
weevil tolerance the idea here being

1131
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:07,239
that if we can have a strawberry plant

1132
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,619
that grows really extensive root systems

1133
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:12,649
that they'll be able to tolerate both

1134
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:15,200
black root rot and black vile evil or

1135
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,660
other root weevil level feeding without

1136
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:21,279
compromising the ability of the plant to

1137
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:26,710
obtain sufficient water nutrients and

1138
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,710
and then be able to provide a good crop

1139
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:33,230
so black root rot is important because

1140
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,349
even though weevil feeding doesn't

1141
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:39,289
increase black root rot incidents black

1142
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:41,269
root rot will remove the amount of root

1143
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:43,548
tissue that's functions and it increases

1144
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:45,759
the injurious pneus of additional root

1145
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,759
loss

1146
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:55,380
now both Gemini did squealing trials

1147
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:59,699
with commercial varieties of of

1148
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,320
strawberries to see what their what the

1149
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:03,779
variation was amongst them for a

1150
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,580
susceptibility to root rocks into root

1151
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,870
weevils and I was able to determine that

1152
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:13,409
the leaf hair and nitrogen

1153
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:15,299
characteristics would affect feeding and

1154
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:21,179
there was some other variety and some

1155
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:23,280
other factors involved too and the idea

1156
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:25,199
behind my breeding program has been to

1157
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,300
hybridize the superior varieties that

1158
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,369
would have both some tolerance of black

1159
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,940
vile evil and some tolerance to root

1160
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:35,429
rots to permit directional selection to

1161
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,909
improve the very the favorable traits

1162
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:42,149
you can think about this in terms of

1163
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:43,920
animal breeding where we had you know

1164
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:46,680
ancestrally some sort of something like

1165
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:50,750
a wolf and selective breeding for a

1166
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:54,119
larger size animal would lead to the

1167
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:56,670
Great Dane and selection for a smaller

1168
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:59,069
animal leads to chihuahua but they

1169
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,960
started with the same ancestry and we

1170
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,480
could do the same sort of process with

1171
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,909
selective breeding with strawberries by

1172
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,519
simply planting those strawberries in an

1173
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:11,699
environment where there is extreme root

1174
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:14,190
disease presence and then only taking

1175
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:16,199
those survivors that fruit well and

1176
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:21,990
using them as parents for the next

1177
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:24,539
generation using this approach we've

1178
00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:28,039
come up with a variety that's shown on

1179
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:33,570
the left I call rubicon that should be

1180
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:36,269
released probably in 2012 it's being

1181
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:41,160
it's named now and it is undergoing

1182
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:43,500
patenting that's from our own breeding

1183
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,559
program and there's another variety that

1184
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:51,210
comes from British Columbia from a cross

1185
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:53,279
made in 1994 called stolo that is the

1186
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,039
claim is that it is resistant to black

1187
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,230
vine weevils and so it will be very

1188
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:01,070
interesting to compare these two new

1189
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,849
varieties to see how well they perform

1190
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,010
where there's a high

1191
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:07,400
degree of root disease and black file

1192
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,400
evils

1193
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:18,389
and for managing root weevils are really

1194
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:21,179
three two or three major approaches I'll

1195
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:24,588
start out with biological control of

1196
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:28,919
which really the only commercialized

1197
00:54:24,588 --> 00:54:31,828
tool that's been tested has been the use

1198
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,269
of insect pathogenic nematodes I'll

1199
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:37,800
mention predatory ground beetles as we

1200
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:39,920
proceed because there are some other

1201
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,780
practices that may impact their

1202
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:47,849
effectiveness in suppressing like very

1203
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:49,769
evil populations insect pathogenic

1204
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:52,289
nematodes there are a number of species

1205
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:55,070
available there are ones that are

1206
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:58,230
principally active in searching out

1207
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:00,030
hosts near the surface of the soil that

1208
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:03,088
would be stunning Yuma copper cap see

1209
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:07,380
and there are other species at arm that

1210
00:55:03,088 --> 00:55:11,309
dig deeply in the soil they move through

1211
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:15,720
the soil on a water film on the soil

1212
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:18,500
particles how to wrap dittus species arm

1213
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:22,730
the commercial varieties that are deeper

1214
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,730
that dig deeper into the soil

1215
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,660
number of advantages in working with

1216
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,539
nematodes one of which is that they're

1217
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:34,528
exempt from pesticide regulation because

1218
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:37,130
here multicellular organism they're not

1219
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:41,778
really considered to be pesticides

1220
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:44,970
extremely safe for to the environment

1221
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:48,059
and they don't cause pollution of any

1222
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:50,159
sort and more importantly I think

1223
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,500
they're able to seek out their hosts

1224
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:55,288
they move on their own to where the host

1225
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,150
is in the soil and they're also able to

1226
00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:00,180
multiply in the host so you could have

1227
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:02,369
permanent establishment of these insect

1228
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:05,149
pathogenic nematodes in the soil that

1229
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:07,980
then would lead to a suppression of the

1230
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:11,568
weevil populations over a long period of

1231
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,568
time multiple years

1232
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:21,659
have an image of an infective juvenile

1233
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:24,718
stage insect pathogenic nematode it's

1234
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:26,608
only about half a millimeter long and

1235
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,789
that's the stage of nematode that would

1236
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:31,558
be purchased from a commercial provider

1237
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:34,559
those are applied almost as you would

1238
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:37,739
apply a an insecticide to the field

1239
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,869
irrigated in to incorporate the

1240
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:41,579
nematodes and allow them to then move

1241
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:44,489
through the soil on under their own

1242
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:47,190
power they seek out the host and when

1243
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:50,159
they infect the host this is a compu

1244
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:52,469
block here they will go through a few

1245
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,568
generations of development within the

1246
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:59,130
host and then will exit the host in

1247
00:56:54,568 --> 00:57:01,228
extremely large numbers those in fact

1248
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,930
that next cycle if infective juvenile

1249
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:09,169
nematodes can then go through the soil

1250
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:09,169
and cause additional cycles of infection

1251
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:17,469
one of the important things about these

1252
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:20,409
nematodes that you need to understand is

1253
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:22,299
that they have mutualistic bacteria that

1254
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:25,269
live within their guts when the

1255
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,160
nematodes infect a soil-dwelling insect

1256
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:30,670
one of the first things they do is that

1257
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:33,759
they release these bacteria into the

1258
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:36,460
kemah seal or the body cavity of that

1259
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,090
insect and then the bacteria multiply

1260
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:42,849
within the insect's body and what we

1261
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:47,500
have here is a petri dish in which there

1262
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:52,139
were the mutualistic bacteria placed on

1263
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,139
the agar plate and it's showing that the

1264
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:57,039
that there is a zone of inhibition

1265
00:57:54,639 --> 00:58:01,739
meaning that those bacteria are

1266
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,739
producing antibiotics that protect

1267
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:07,960
inside the insect protect it from being

1268
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,150
colonized by fungi or anything else that

1269
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,079
might compete with the ability of that

1270
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:15,789
the nematodes to complete development

1271
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:20,949
these bacteria can have distinctive

1272
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:22,269
colors so when we look at and a black

1273
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:28,389
vine weevil larvae that have been

1274
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:30,610
infected by insect pathogenic nematodes

1275
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:34,739
they'll take on the color of the

1276
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:36,519
bacteria the bacterial mutualistic

1277
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:40,569
mutualists that are found with the

1278
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:42,519
nematodes the black final evil on the

1279
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:45,010
right was infected with the steiner Numa

1280
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,869
species the one in the center was

1281
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:50,740
infected with a header AB dieded

1282
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:54,789
nematode which will would cause the

1283
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:57,459
larvae to turn a reddish or or brown

1284
00:58:54,789 --> 00:59:00,960
color and the larvae on the right is a

1285
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,960
healthy black file evil

1286
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:06,829
I've done field trials with insect

1287
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:10,579
pathogenic no toads and this is showing

1288
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:13,730
the results it's a an assessment in the

1289
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:17,059
fall of how many larvae there were in a

1290
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:19,849
sample of two plants and the dates that

1291
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:21,799
are given on the x-axis are the dates of

1292
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:25,670
application for the insect pathogenic

1293
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:28,519
nematodes so in early May application

1294
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:32,570
when we came back in October and checked

1295
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:34,969
we had a very low number of larvae

1296
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:41,300
around those root systems as we progress

1297
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:45,609
through field season 2 jun and then to

1298
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:48,019
august the percent reduction of the

1299
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:51,640
larvae around the root system compared

1300
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:51,639
to the untreated check was insignificant

1301
00:59:55,108 --> 01:00:00,449
the explanation I have for this these

1302
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:02,998
dynamics are as follows that when we do

1303
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:05,879
an early May application of naruto's

1304
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:08,129
this sequence significance of this arrow

1305
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,400
here is application of nematodes in the

1306
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:13,980
tiding those overwintered larvae and

1307
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,559
perhaps the pupae that are present in

1308
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,179
the soil might be infected to the degree

1309
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,869
of thirty to forty percent of the

1310
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:24,798
population that doesn't do a whole lot

1311
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:27,480
for reducing the black vine weevil

1312
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:30,268
population however what it does do is

1313
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,980
allow the nematodes to develop to the

1314
01:00:30,268 --> 01:00:34,528
point where there will be infective

1315
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:37,440
juvenile nematodes present in the soil

1316
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:40,528
at great note large numbers when the

1317
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,409
next generation of eggs of the weevils

1318
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:46,798
would be hatching and so there'd be

1319
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:51,868
ninety percent or greater infection of

1320
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:56,998
that population of weevil larvae in

1321
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:59,880
august or September some guidelines for

1322
01:00:56,998 --> 01:01:01,588
using insect pathogenic nematodes first

1323
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:07,108
you should make sure that the soil is

1324
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:09,989
moist if you do apply nematodes apply

1325
01:01:07,108 --> 01:01:11,880
them with any kind of liquid application

1326
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:13,858
of spray equipment i would suggest

1327
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,519
though because nematodes are very

1328
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:20,190
expensive to use a boom sprayer probably

1329
01:01:17,518 --> 01:01:27,719
banned the nematodes onto the onto the

1330
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:29,818
row as narrow a band as possible do not

1331
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:32,509
use a piston pump because that shares

1332
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:36,599
the nematodes and will kill them and

1333
01:01:32,509 --> 01:01:39,630
then you can even apply irrigation while

1334
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:41,338
spraying the neva toads to provide an

1335
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:44,519
opportunity to move the limit oats

1336
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:48,719
immediately into the soil where they be

1337
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:51,028
protected from sunlight one of the great

1338
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:54,509
challenges is people trying to apply

1339
01:01:51,028 --> 01:01:56,338
these nematodes on a sunny day nematodes

1340
01:01:54,509 --> 01:02:01,048
will only survive for a couple minutes

1341
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:03,599
in in the sunlight typical guidelines

1342
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:06,329
are to apply about 1 billion or treated

1343
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,970
acre now of course if you're banding

1344
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:11,190
them on that means it might only

1345
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:13,679
be treating essentially half or

1346
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:16,349
one-third of the total area of the field

1347
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:19,649
so that means that you would only need

1348
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:24,690
to buy proportionately that much many

1349
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:28,769
fewer nematodes to treat a field overall

1350
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:31,230
the results from various field trials

1351
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:34,440
and around the world has suggested that

1352
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:36,960
a fall application could even be more

1353
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,650
effective than a spring application

1354
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,650
timing but in in both instances soil

1355
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:46,260
temperature needs to be greater than 60

1356
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,090
degrees and generally speaking the warm

1357
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,630
of the soil the better these nematodes

1358
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:53,519
will perform not only will the nemah

1359
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,910
toads be able to move through the soil

1360
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:59,039
faster at higher soil temperatures but

1361
01:02:56,909 --> 01:03:01,348
the bacteria that are associated with

1362
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,769
the nematodes will multiply in the

1363
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:07,920
infected hosts much faster with warmer

1364
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:10,259
temperatures and it's the multiplication

1365
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:15,570
of those bacteria that actually kill the

1366
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:19,109
insect host we've done field sampling

1367
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:21,300
throughout Connecticut and looking in

1368
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:23,819
growers fields for the presence of

1369
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,820
insect pathogenic nematodes and one of

1370
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,890
those surprises for me was to compare

1371
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:35,088
fields in which nematodes had never been

1372
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:37,500
applied in which there were eight fields

1373
01:03:35,088 --> 01:03:40,679
where we found insect pathogenic

1374
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:44,460
nematodes and then 39 fields that had

1375
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:46,409
none and compare that to fields where we

1376
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:51,539
had purposefully applied commercially

1377
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:53,608
the elbow nematodes and about six fields

1378
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:56,489
out of a door or three-quarters of the

1379
01:03:53,608 --> 01:04:00,869
fields we were able to recover insect

1380
01:03:56,489 --> 01:04:03,029
pathogenic nematodes probably one of the

1381
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:05,250
more important messages here is that

1382
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:08,250
lincec pathogenic nematodes are found in

1383
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:10,889
our soils and if they're given an

1384
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:15,230
opportunity to infect root weevils they

1385
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:19,559
do and that can be an important way to

1386
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:21,358
suppress weevil populations generally

1387
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:23,320
speaking

1388
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,400
application of commercially available

1389
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:29,680
insect pathogenic nematodes has been

1390
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,380
kind of so-so in terms of suppression of

1391
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,909
weevil populations and I think that

1392
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:37,240
there are a number of problems one of

1393
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:39,699
which is that the commercially available

1394
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:42,579
nematodes may be of questionable quality

1395
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:47,799
compared to those populations that we

1396
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:49,659
find naturalized in our soils so

1397
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,210
basically they're great if they're

1398
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:56,170
already there but because of the

1399
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:58,929
requirements for warm soils and there's

1400
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:01,900
really a great degree of interference if

1401
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:05,819
there is a significant clay content in

1402
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,960
the soil there are very specific

1403
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:11,289
conditions under which these nematodes

1404
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:14,980
can work well to suppress root weevils

1405
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:18,509
and generally speaking there they've

1406
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,510
only been mediocre

1407
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:23,659
if we

1408
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,590
move on to chemical control they're

1409
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:30,679
basically two strategies if you remember

1410
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:33,590
in the introduction for this talking I

1411
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,119
told you that blankfein we will we volts

1412
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,280
will feed for about three to four weeks

1413
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,710
before they are able to start laying

1414
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:43,700
eggs this has been considered in the

1415
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:45,470
past to be a great window of opportunity

1416
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:49,189
in which we might be able to kill the

1417
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:51,379
adults and interrupt the life cycle

1418
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:55,340
before they have any opportunity to

1419
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:57,680
start laying eggs and the other approach

1420
01:05:55,340 --> 01:06:01,240
would be to kill the love larvae while

1421
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,239
they are feeding on the root systems

1422
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:09,590
interestingly for strawberries the

1423
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:13,100
strategy for several decades has been to

1424
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:16,180
kill the adults whereas when you look at

1425
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:19,400
other crop systems such as nursery crops

1426
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:21,679
it's pretty well recognized that

1427
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:28,880
targeting the larvae has been much more

1428
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:30,379
successful in managing root weevils one

1429
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,780
of the reasons why this might be the

1430
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:37,519
case is when you think about black v

1431
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:40,630
weevil the plants the other plants on

1432
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:45,800
which they feed her some notoriously

1433
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:51,019
poisonous plants such as taxes on the

1434
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:53,450
left or rhododendron on the right and so

1435
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:57,050
black vinyl evil are adapted to feed on

1436
01:06:53,449 --> 01:07:02,659
many toxic plants and this suggests that

1437
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:06,440
they have a really well developed suite

1438
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:09,639
of detoxification enzymes that may

1439
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:12,470
predispose them to be able to detoxify

1440
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:15,190
various insecticides that we're using to

1441
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:15,189
try to kill them

1442
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:25,879
I tried an approach of targeting the

1443
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:29,119
larvae this past year in a field trial

1444
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,969
and I compared it with the standard

1445
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,150
approach of applying brigade now for

1446
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:38,318
those growers in Canada the equivalent

1447
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:40,849
would be to target the adults with

1448
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:46,338
matador which is lambda sigh hey

1449
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:48,679
Lutheran brigade is bifenthrin and by

1450
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:52,009
fenton and landis a halo throne which is

1451
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:54,199
the active ingredient of Matador are

1452
01:07:52,009 --> 01:08:00,559
very similar in their properties they're

1453
01:07:54,199 --> 01:08:03,579
broad-spectrum pyrethroids so this is a

1454
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,579
comparison of

1455
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:15,560
treatments that are targeting the larvae

1456
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:21,489
actually adults or larvae that's with a

1457
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:25,539
new insecticide called coragem targeting

1458
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:25,539
the larvae only

1459
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:39,589
with platinum or targeting just the

1460
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:46,880
adults with brigade and what's

1461
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:50,479
intriguing to me is that oops is that

1462
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,039
the numbers of larvae for those

1463
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,158
treatments that were targeting the

1464
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:58,039
larvae were reduced by about half

1465
01:08:54,158 --> 01:09:01,098
compared to the untreated check whereas

1466
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:04,639
for the the treatment with brigade which

1467
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:06,469
was targeting the adults of the number

1468
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:12,319
of larvae were no different than the

1469
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:14,179
untreated jacks this was reflected in

1470
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,359
the appearance of the strawberry plants

1471
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:20,868
in the field too and what I'd like to

1472
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:25,009
point out to you is this patch of red

1473
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:29,868
foliage that was the bifenthrin treated

1474
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:32,000
plot and that's when I look at red

1475
01:09:29,868 --> 01:09:35,328
foliage at the end of the season that's

1476
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,759
a good indication of damage to the root

1477
01:09:35,328 --> 01:09:42,948
system and the plan severe plant stress

1478
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:44,630
and so it really suggests to me that the

1479
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:46,698
approach that we've been taking for many

1480
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:49,190
years in trying to target the adult

1481
01:09:46,698 --> 01:09:54,529
weevils for control and strawberry

1482
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:57,859
fields is really rather misguided one of

1483
01:09:54,529 --> 01:10:00,019
the reasons why we might see an extreme

1484
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:03,488
amount of damage where we've applied

1485
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:06,650
bifenthrin or even a or matador

1486
01:10:03,488 --> 01:10:09,649
targeting the adults is that that would

1487
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:12,289
have tremendous consequences also in

1488
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:14,569
killing predator editors of various

1489
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:17,510
sorts of which the most important would

1490
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:22,819
be predatory ground beetles here we have

1491
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:25,909
the adult and the adult and the larva

1492
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:30,819
both of which are really ferocious

1493
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:30,819
predators of black vine weevil

1494
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:35,520
just an idea of the kind of dynamics

1495
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,889
that might be taking place are shown

1496
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,860
with some work that i did with

1497
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:43,500
field-grown nurseries in Connecticut and

1498
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:46,380
what I'd like to do is compare the

1499
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:50,729
intensively managed field that's a

1500
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:53,460
column on the left and the ratio of the

1501
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:56,669
Predators which are the crabbits to the

1502
01:10:53,460 --> 01:11:00,239
black vine weevils in that nursery

1503
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:02,010
situation the net was sprayed

1504
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:06,059
intensively with pyrethroids

1505
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:10,220
insecticides and it had a rather

1506
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:13,680
unfortunate effect of killing off the

1507
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:17,159
good guys and allowing the bad guys the

1508
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,079
black vine weevils to persist whereas a

1509
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:21,659
field where the grower didn't even know

1510
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:24,479
that they had black vine weevils they

1511
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:26,849
didn't spray at home and the poor black

1512
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:29,549
vine weevils in this field are subjected

1513
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:33,060
to about a 300 to 1 ratio of predators

1514
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:35,400
to themselves so it suggests to me that

1515
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:40,890
targeting the adults of black vinyl

1516
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:42,569
evils might be really misplaced there

1517
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:46,530
are cultural practices that could also

1518
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:51,719
be useful one of which has been tested

1519
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:54,420
in in Canada and the Ontario omelet see

1520
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:56,520
Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and

1521
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:59,460
well I can't remember the entire acronym

1522
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:02,370
but the this was published in 2006 by

1523
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:05,670
tolman at all what they're using is a

1524
01:12:02,369 --> 01:12:09,029
plastic sheet with a few little supports

1525
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:12,690
and that's a place so that the bottom

1526
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:15,779
edge is in the soil so if you have an

1527
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:20,839
old strawberry field it's heavily

1528
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:20,840
infested with weevils on one side and

1529
01:12:24,329 --> 01:12:29,640
planting young planting on the other

1530
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:32,100
side you'd be able to stop the weevils

1531
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:38,840
from wandering straight from one field

1532
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:43,860
to the other and this this barrier has

1533
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:47,819
oops sorry the barrier has right at the

1534
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:53,239
edge a pitfall trap so weevils that are

1535
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:59,009
crawling along the edge of the barrier

1536
01:12:53,239 --> 01:13:00,599
okay they'll simply walk along the edge

1537
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:02,730
of the barrier and then when they come

1538
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:06,180
to the end they fall into the pitfall

1539
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:09,689
trap and when different types of

1540
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:12,150
barriers were compared the sheet barrier

1541
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:14,429
was found to catch a lot of the weevils

1542
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:18,379
whereas a different type of barrier was

1543
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:20,909
not but from a practical point of view

1544
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:24,210
one of the things that we see commonly

1545
01:13:20,909 --> 01:13:27,689
with especially with them pick your own

1546
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:30,170
type operations is that there's really

1547
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:32,969
limited space for planting strawberries

1548
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:35,970
when growers are putting in fields of

1549
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:37,619
strawberries right next to old plantings

1550
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:40,289
that are heavily infested with weevils

1551
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:42,750
and when the grower is powe under those

1552
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:46,619
old plants the weevils will simply go to

1553
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:48,270
where there's good vegetation and so

1554
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,430
that means that they immediately invade

1555
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:52,980
the new planting and you don't realize

1556
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:55,860
this until next year when you have a

1557
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:59,459
severe infestation in the new planting

1558
01:13:55,859 --> 01:14:03,529
so the idea is to put in a a barrier

1559
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:06,480
that would be the plastic plastic sheet

1560
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:09,569
that separates the two fields and when

1561
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,759
you plow under the old plants have that

1562
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:13,529
barrier in place already and have a

1563
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,289
collection pale right at the end of the

1564
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:21,809
barrier to pick up those adult weevils

1565
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:24,630
in summary some of the things that you

1566
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:27,630
can do for root weevil management is to

1567
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:30,060
monitor your planting to determine

1568
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,279
whether you have a problem the easiest

1569
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:35,010
thing is to check to see whether you

1570
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:37,920
have stressed plants that have the red

1571
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:40,350
leaves turning in the phone

1572
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,520
look for patches in your fields where

1573
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:47,850
the leaves turn red ahead of the plants

1574
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,230
in the rest of the field and then that

1575
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:52,140
could be caused by any number of things

1576
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:55,829
root weevils white grubs root diseases

1577
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:57,450
Nana toads so then you have to dig up

1578
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:00,059
some plants and take a look to see

1579
01:14:57,449 --> 01:15:02,159
whether the roots are diseased or

1580
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:05,670
whether you have larvae associated with

1581
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:12,170
those damaged plants when the other tool

1582
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:12,170
it's very useful for monitoring is to

1583
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:20,399
look for leaf notching and that you

1584
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,670
would do right at the end of harvest

1585
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:26,009
before you renovate and take a hundred

1586
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:29,760
leaf sample and count the number of

1587
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:31,560
leaves that have notches in them if you

1588
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,810
have more than fifty percent of the

1589
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:37,289
leaves not by weevils that signifies

1590
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:40,590
that you have a high population that

1591
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:42,720
needs to be managed I would suggest only

1592
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:45,180
considering insect pathogenic nematodes

1593
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:50,430
where where conditions permit basically

1594
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:53,930
sandy soil and warm soil temperatures at

1595
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:57,780
the time of application of the nematodes

1596
01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:00,240
consider planting tolerant varieties of

1597
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:03,179
strawberries tolerant to both black root

1598
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:05,010
rot and to black by weevil and in

1599
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,090
interesting an important consideration

1600
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:10,980
is to limit the nitrogen application

1601
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:16,829
nitrogen excessive nitrogen conditions

1602
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:19,829
lead to much greater fecundity of the

1603
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:21,840
adult weevils they're able to convert

1604
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:24,569
the foliage in two eggs much more

1605
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,400
efficiently and so if you use excessive

1606
01:16:24,569 --> 01:16:30,750
leave nitrogen that could lead to

1607
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:32,750
outbreaks of these weevils now of the

1608
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:36,210
insecticides that I tested in the field

1609
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:39,149
only one of which is registered at this

1610
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:42,000
time for control of black by weevil and

1611
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:46,139
that's platinum that's the active

1612
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,960
ingredient is is thiamethoxam and I feel

1613
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:51,360
that that's based upon both my work and

1614
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:56,130
work from the Pacific Northwest that

1615
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:59,429
that would be a good strategy i think

1616
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:01,199
that the corojum product also should be

1617
01:16:59,429 --> 01:17:03,090
considered for registration for

1618
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,638
management of Wi-Fi louisville on other

1619
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:09,659
root weevils it has extremely low

1620
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:12,659
mammalian toxicity and so it would be a

1621
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:17,179
really good tool for us to consider and

1622
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:19,589
then lastly use exclusion barriers to

1623
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:21,929
prevent weevils from moving from

1624
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:25,949
currently invested fields to newly

1625
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:28,440
planted fields that's my presentation so

1626
01:17:25,948 --> 01:17:34,710
I I think I'll open it up to questions

1627
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:37,488
or turn it over to Kathy questions for

1628
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:37,489
rich or Jim

1629
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,989
while we're waiting for those I'm going

1630
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:46,639
to switch to the end screen and I want

1631
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:49,279
to thank you again for participating in

1632
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:55,760
the Nazca winter webinar series and

1633
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:58,279
encourage you to go to the website where

1634
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,940
we have a short five question survey to

1635
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:04,460
help us get a feel for how well you

1636
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:06,799
enjoy the series and what sorts of

1637
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:09,310
topics you would like to have in the

1638
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,310
next round

1639
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:17,029
okay Kevin schooley has a question for

1640
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:19,989
rich how would you handle or manage

1641
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:19,988
fields that are being removed

1642
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,989
rich

1643
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:32,930
you

1644
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:46,569
rich if you lost your audio

1645
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,330
Oh

1646
01:18:55,579 --> 01:18:57,640
you

1647
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,030
okay sorry about that

1648
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:28,949
couldn't hear anything because it was

1649
01:19:25,029 --> 01:19:31,509
echoing so badly in my ears I turned by

1650
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:35,679
my headset off except for the microphone

1651
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:39,159
yeah related to managing fields that are

1652
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:41,500
being removed there are a couple

1653
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:43,869
problems here one is one of which is

1654
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:47,920
that you may have really extreme number

1655
01:19:43,869 --> 01:19:50,590
of root weevils in that field there's no

1656
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:54,909
practical way to kill off the adults

1657
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:57,730
with insecticides growers have tried

1658
01:19:54,909 --> 01:20:02,229
using these pyrethroids right at the

1659
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:04,509
time that they finish harvest now but

1660
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:07,089
that hasn't seemed to really do a

1661
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:11,280
tremendous amount of good so really the

1662
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:15,069
exclusion barrier to protect nearby

1663
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:18,509
nearby fields is one of the best ideas

1664
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:18,509
to come along in quite a while

1665
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:29,578
there's a question from Gary post he's

1666
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:34,279
wondering if Corrigan is more effective

1667
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:40,349
than imidacloprid ah great question

1668
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:42,929
couraging is a different class of

1669
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:46,889
insecticides I think a better question

1670
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:51,059
might be comparing platinum with

1671
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:53,939
imidacloprid platinum and imidacloprid

1672
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:56,550
are in the same class and I've always

1673
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:58,829
seemed very mediocre results of

1674
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:01,529
imidacloprid for targeting black vine

1675
01:20:58,828 --> 01:21:03,029
weevil if that bear got into quite a bit

1676
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:05,248
of trouble when they were trying to

1677
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:09,509
market use of imidacloprid for black

1678
01:21:05,248 --> 01:21:11,849
vine weevil control in a special

1679
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:14,760
strawberry production system in England

1680
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:17,429
where they grew strawberries in pretty

1681
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,260
much like containers and they'd set them

1682
01:21:17,429 --> 01:21:22,199
into a cooler and then they bring them

1683
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:25,498
out into a greenhouse to force the

1684
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:27,629
flowering and fruit development and

1685
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:30,288
corset tried to use imidacloprid for a

1686
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:32,969
black vine weevil control in that system

1687
01:21:30,288 --> 01:21:34,768
found that they it didn't work well at

1688
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:37,349
all and they ended up with worse

1689
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:40,289
outbreaks they switched over to using

1690
01:21:37,349 --> 01:21:42,479
instinct pathogenic nematodes the

1691
01:21:40,288 --> 01:21:45,438
thiamethoxam active ingredient in

1692
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:48,439
platinum seems to be a little bit more

1693
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:51,179
effective against these root weevils and

1694
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:53,909
so I think it has good promise there and

1695
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:58,050
then corrigan i think is probably

1696
01:21:53,908 --> 01:22:00,799
equivalent to the thiamethoxam or

1697
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:03,659
platinum for control of root weevils

1698
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:07,019
currently though it is not registered

1699
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:09,118
yet for control of root weevil larvae

1700
01:22:07,019 --> 01:22:12,269
rather it's registration and

1701
01:22:09,118 --> 01:22:17,630
strawberries that is fork origin is for

1702
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:20,998
targeting pests such as lief rollers or

1703
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:23,159
other caterpillars which is kind of

1704
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:25,618
strange because there I've never seen

1705
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:28,679
them to be important pests in strawberry

1706
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:31,078
fields at least having coragem

1707
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,779
registered in any way on strawberries

1708
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:35,109
means that it ought to be a small step

1709
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:37,479
to take so

1710
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:40,299
obtained a label amendment that would

1711
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:43,419
allow it to be used for control of black

1712
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:46,090
5 evil 2 i've worked with that active

1713
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:49,389
ingredient a cell aprem for targeting

1714
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:52,300
white grubs and it's spectacular against

1715
01:22:49,389 --> 01:22:55,480
white grubs and so I think that there

1716
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:57,550
might be a good fit for targeting both

1717
01:22:55,479 --> 01:23:01,649
white grubs and root weevils in

1718
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,650
strawberries with that new insecticide

1719
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:13,420
I think on that far yet I don't have to

1720
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:17,409
call up the company and ask if they'd be

1721
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:21,060
interested are there any other questions

1722
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:21,059
for either gym or rich

1723
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,650
well thank you everyone for

1724
01:23:27,578 --> 01:23:31,569
participating and again I would ask if

1725
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:34,328
you would please just take five minutes

1726
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:36,328
go to the exit survey and fill it out

1727
01:23:34,328 --> 01:23:39,299
for us we would be greatly appreciative

1728
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:41,319
have a wonderful strawberry season and

1729
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:44,849
we hope you'll join us for the next

1730
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:44,849
webinar series thanks
