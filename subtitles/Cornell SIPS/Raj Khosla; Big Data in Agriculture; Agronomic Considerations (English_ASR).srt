1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
University

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,679
thank you Louis for that kind

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,740
introduction

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,599
um pleasure to be here it took me many

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,940
decades to get here I've been wanting to

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,698
come to Cornell one time when we were

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,240
touring the colleges and universities in

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,060
2019 uh for my son

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,159
um we we were scheduled to come to

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,820
Cornell and we were stuck in Newark

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,880
Airport for 36 hours okay so we came

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,219
close but not quite so it's good to be

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,579
here physically although I I see

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,739
familiar faces here and I'm glad I'm on

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,259
the campus and and good to see you all

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,058
thank you for coming

18
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,979
this afternoon here I think the room is

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,799
quite full so that's that's nice always

20
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,159
I still see people keep coming into the

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,419
room that must be the food right

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,640
and that's a good sign when people are

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,198
coming in this direction I have given a

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,198
lot of talks and there have been times

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,840
when people are getting up and and going

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,060
out and I was I was in a one talk like

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,159
that I was sitting up front and the

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,478
person who was giving the talk and

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,760
people were leaving and leaving and

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,579
leaving and then I happened to be the

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,560
last person sitting up front so I said

32
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:21,420
Dwayne uh no the person who was speaking

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,579
said Raj are you really interested in

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,719
what I had to say and I said no not

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,719
really I'm the next speaker

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,739
so um I'm going to talk about Precision

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
agriculture that has been my bread and

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:43,019
butter my uh

39
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:44,759
uh my uh Courier for the last 30 years a

40
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,519
lot of work has happened with graduate

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,519
students like Louis longchamps who spend

42
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,438
seven plus years in my lab first as grad

43
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,500
student then as a postdoc

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,839
and um it has been a really interesting

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,938
Journey so uh it's a little bit of

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,060
looking back and and then bringing you

47
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,438
up to speed where things are today and

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,740
what we're doing

49
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,239
um in in Precision AG in our lab so let

50
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,859
me start with the question I always like

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,878
to start with a question

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,879
what is this picture

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,040
I can give you a hint uh each one of you

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
use it every day

55
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,919
foreign

56
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:49,919
so this is the first uh GPS unit that

57
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,098
was developed by Rockwell Collins In

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,979
1976 Louis mentioned I served two terms

59
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:59,280
on NASA board when I saw this uh picture

60
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,859
first time it was very intriguing

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,159
and in a matter of

62
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,440
less than 20 years it went from a size

63
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,719
of this GPS unit which will fit only

64
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
maybe half a dozen in this room

65
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,500
to something that you can hold it on the

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,480
tip of your finger that's the chip

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,919
that's in every cell phone if you have a

68
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,598
cell phone that you bought after year

69
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:24,359
2000 you have that chip okay and so it's

70
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:28,018
kind of hard to imagine how agriculture

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,080
or Society or technology will change in

72
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,120
the next 20 years okay because that

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,580
happened it surprised even scientist at

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,980
Nasa how dramatically we change you can

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,940
hold it on the tip of your finger it's

76
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:45,719
in every cell phone okay now the initial

77
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:47,759
mobile unit that was given for military

78
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,919
purposes I don't know how many of you

79
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,079
have Googled this picture it looks

80
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,339
something like this

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,900
okay

82
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,420
and this is me in late 90s mapping

83
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,920
nitrogen stress in corn fields in

84
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,559
Colorado

85
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,139
okay so before Kansas State I was in

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,598
Colorado State for 20 some years uh

87
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,318
where I had my entire uh faculty career

88
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:16,259
I'm wearing a welcome velcro tape here

89
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:19,680
with a Data Logger that's connected

90
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:23,399
through artists 232 port to Minolta spad

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,300
meter I have a two kilo monochromatic

92
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:30,599
Fujitsu and tablet with a revolving hard

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,819
disk not a solid state and of course I'm

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,340
carrying bunch of deep cycle batteries

95
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,139
to power the Trimble unit it used to be

96
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,719
heavy and the more you walked it got

97
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,759
heavier okay but that's how we were

98
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,340
mapping nitrogen stress at that that

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,000
time and that would be the common theme

100
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:50,159
you will see in my talk today

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,100
ability to quantify

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
variability in crop and salt parameters

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,960
that's what my entire career has been

104
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,299
about and then creating decisions to

105
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,698
make those management okay

106
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,780
so now I now take you to 1983 what

107
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,780
happened in 83.

108
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,459
absolutely right the GPS became

109
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,620
accessible for civilian purposes okay

110
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:18,418
and so if you took my Precision act

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,060
course I taught three courses at

112
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,000
Colorado State one of the first

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,280
Laboratories we will do is take multiple

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,680
different GPS units that work on

115
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,978
different frequencies go to a benchmark

116
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,139
and we'll do an error analysis okay so

117
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,300
you do the northing and the easting and

118
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,418
then you calculate the circular error

119
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,840
probable meaning where does the 50 of

120
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:45,359
the data reside in XY domain and lo and

121
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,279
behold back then it you know you're

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,860
lucky if you're within the 50 meters

123
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,038
plus minus 50 meters and I pulled a

124
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,560
paper from IEEE and lo and behold the

125
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,319
horizontal positioning for standard

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,780
signal which is SPS used to be 100

127
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,000
meters and what military had without

128
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,698
correction which is precise positioning

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,978
system used to be 20 meters okay so we

130
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,900
have come a long ways and if you look at

131
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,719
the pub Publications that were coming

132
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,779
out during those days were focused on

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,120
hey we got access to GPS and this is how

134
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,000
we can improve the signaling and make it

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,560
more precise and differential

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,240
and I don't know if you guys can read

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,519
the authors here I want to draw your

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
attention to one individual Brad

139
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,120
Parkinson

140
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,559
who is he

141
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:40,139
a lot of people don't know about this

142
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:43,579
Brad Parkinson is the father of GPS

143
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:47,519
global Positioning Systems okay a

144
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:50,579
professor and Stanford and that's where

145
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,918
him and his colleagues for a thumb uh

146
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,639
they are the brains behind the GPS in

147
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:59,639
fact just before covet Queen Elizabeth

148
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,579
awarded them with a million pounds award

149
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,220
for being instrumental in engineering

150
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,099
okay all four were four were

151
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,940
on that and I got to know Dr Parkinson

152
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,939
quite well I was uh privileged to be he

153
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:18,300
he's the co-chair still today he's the

154
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,339
co-chair of NASA board U.S presidential

155
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,259
Advisory board on positioning navigation

156
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,038
and training this is one of our meetings

157
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:29,220
in Washington DC that's him and some of

158
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:32,639
you may know uh Dr James Ginger he was

159
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,580
the first Secretary of of uh energy and

160
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,319
then he had multiple other assignments

161
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,180
and um

162
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,500
so I look a little bit younger I'm still

163
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,418
young right

164
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,240
um I want to draw your attention to the

165
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:48,299
person who's sitting right next to me uh

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,680
late Dr Ronald hatch

167
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,079
so today decimeter accuracy in uh

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,280
tractor systems or combine systems are

169
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,680
so common

170
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,679
he's the brains behind that so he was

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,639
the brains behind the Starfire that John

172
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,660
Deere inherited and be able to provide

173
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,220
decimeter accuracy without any

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,520
Correctional signals because they got

175
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,780
access to not the encrypted data but the

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:20,279
frequency on Dual frequencies and GPS so

177
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:23,279
um so a lot of contribution there and um

178
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:26,098
while the literature was focused more on

179
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,939
hey how could we improve accuracy of GPS

180
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,038
in those days there was this individual

181
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,918
whose Wheels were turning

182
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,799
that hey we now have access to this is

183
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,199
Dr late Dr Pierre Robert who was

184
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,899
designated as the father of precision

185
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,759
agriculture a Belgian scientists

186
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,940
established the first Precision act

187
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,100
Center in the University of Minnesota a

188
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,700
good friend and colleague he passed away

189
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:57,860
untimely he was thinking as as a

190
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,240
Visionary as he was that how one day

191
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,159
location-based agriculture may become a

192
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,480
reality and so after one of these

193
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,039
tri-society meetings ASA cssa and SSA

194
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,560
these colleagues are sitting in a bar in

195
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,319
Chicago you know with their beer in

196
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,659
their hand and they start scribbling on

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,700
a piece of napkin here I reconstructed

198
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,600
it by by the way it's not the real

199
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:26,180
napkin I don't hold that with me uh that

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:31,259
that one day that we will embracing GPS

201
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:32,819
as a mundane Affair and and so ipni

202
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,620
which is no longer longer their

203
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,920
international plan nutrition Institute

204
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,500
closed down after 75 years took this to

205
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,639
their designers and this was put

206
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,740
together

207
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,299
so this this was at one point of time

208
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,080
and Harold may remember that this was

209
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,899
one of the most widely used infogram or

210
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,540
what Precision agriculture may become

211
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,600
one day it came out in I think in 84 or

212
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:00,240
85 something like that but one thing

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,040
that that the founders of precision act

214
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,778
cautioned us

215
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:08,039
that once we are uh you know engaged in

216
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,919
location-based agriculture

217
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,299
that'll give rise to lots and lots and

218
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,159
lots of data

219
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,859
and I think that's where we are today

220
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,439
that's exactly where we are today and so

221
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,379
I'll be talking a lot about engagement

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,019
with data and data analytics as we

223
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,958
continue to solve the challenge of

224
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,299
spatial temporal management looking into

225
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,179
the future okay

226
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,519
variability happens right I was flying

227
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,259
in yesterday I saw a tremendous amount

228
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,799
of variability in landscape and

229
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,620
topography and soil and soil type crop

230
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,740
cover uh stuff like that this is a

231
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,320
picture taken from a um from an airplane

232
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,778
looking down it could be anywhere in

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,120
Colorado Western Kansas parts of

234
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:56,278
Nebraska and so forth and so the fields

235
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,519
are not alike so this is landscape scale

236
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,820
variability I can zoom in on a farm that

237
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,620
may have 20 30 pivots and other

238
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,600
grain-fed Agriculture and they still

239
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,139
don't look alike so that's a farm scale

240
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,839
variability I can zoom in on one field

241
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:16,139
where we have done some work and you

242
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,440
still see variability in soil and and

243
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,240
that inherent variability is what we

244
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,800
have been trying in my lab along with

245
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,839
several others were after quantifying

246
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,939
without having to actually acquire a lot

247
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,740
of soil samples how could we do it in

248
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,260
economic atomically affordable manner

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,600
less labor-intensive manner this is

250
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,179
where the remote sensing came in

251
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,700
okay and so it has an implication

252
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,979
because

253
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,320
oftentimes not always but oftentimes

254
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,360
this inherent variability I'm going to

255
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,760
click next and show you the crops

256
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,220
growing on these fields translates into

257
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,620
that crop although the entire field is

258
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,620
treated uniformly that inherent

259
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,480
variability if I were to go here it

260
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,179
translates into the crop production

261
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,860
system okay so if you're putting 150

262
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,078
pounds of nitrogen across the entire

263
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,940
field you know it's not in your corn not

264
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,439
across the entire field and that was the

265
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,660
whole point there's a holy grail of

266
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,820
precision agriculture how do we make

267
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,039
Taylor

268
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:20,459
Management Systems to feed the entire

269
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:24,299
field and it has been 30 years since our

270
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:26,819
capability to quantify grain yield you

271
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,278
know it's a pixel by pixel combine is

272
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,500
moving on the motion you can we can pick

273
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,778
but

274
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,339
unfortunately even today how are farmers

275
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,338
managing their fields

276
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,560
and so I'm gonna I you know

277
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,959
um our lab did this quick analysis many

278
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,799
many years back so here's your combine

279
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,018
and he's just a schematic here so it's

280
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,120
moving and it's harvesting depending on

281
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,639
the size of the header six row 12 row

282
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,159
whatever number of rows and every second

283
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,560
is dropping a pixel quantifying how much

284
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,899
granial is coming from there you Stitch

285
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,539
the whole thing together it becomes a

286
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,860
digital yield map so quantifying how

287
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,659
much you're harvesting from each and

288
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,339
every part of the field you go through

289
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,399
the cleaning process because they're

290
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,500
errors associated with that uh once you

291
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,320
have cleaned the data if you were to run

292
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,958
quick statistics it'll give you the uh

293
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,420
you know frequency distribution here and

294
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:31,078
in this particular example average is

295
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:34,019
180 bushel to an acre okay this example

296
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,338
is more than 20 years old

297
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,399
so

298
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,839
here's simple query that you can write

299
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,200
in any of the platforms that you're

300
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,380
working on so how many pixels match the

301
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,379
average

302
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:54,360
date louder

303
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,399
less than 20 any other guesses

304
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,120
zero okay is there some pessimists in

305
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,679
the room exactly

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,620
yes it's a mathematical average it

307
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,620
doesn't in this example two percent okay

308
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,899
and I remember one of my colleagues at

309
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,600
the keynote in info AG many years back

310
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,700
and said well if you are chasing average

311
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,860
you're missing the target 100 of the

312
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,680
time and I said you exaggerated it's 98

313
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,300
of the time

314
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,458
so well that's and when we showed this

315
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,078
data exactly like what you said it's the

316
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,958
mathematical mean it doesn't exist

317
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,939
anywhere so to satisfy Farmers curiosity

318
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,739
we said okay how about we go plus and

319
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,240
minus one percent of the mean that may

320
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,860
be more realistic what do you think

321
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,539
happens now

322
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,820
okay

323
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,919
or ten percent yeah you know 10 12

324
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,800
depends on the field and so forth in

325
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,620
fact to to further illustrate our point

326
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,319
we went plus minus five percent and now

327
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:54,778
you're talking about 10 bushels on each

328
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,959
side is still what happens is 40 percent

329
00:14:54,778 --> 00:15:01,320
so you know if you're chasing average it

330
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:03,539
doesn't exist it doesn't exist it's when

331
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,680
was the last time that you had normal

332
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:07,679
weather

333
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,679
foreign

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,339
so even with that plus minus 10 bushel

335
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,820
on each side even if you were to call

336
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,040
that large window as average

337
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,760
20 of the field one-fifth of the field

338
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,620
you over fertilized in this example and

339
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,000
35 percent of the field you did not

340
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,639
apply enough

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,559
okay that's an over simplistic version

342
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
there are soil fertility soil scientists

343
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,799
including myself in the room they will

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,740
disagree but this is just an example to

345
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,259
give you a point when you are chasing

346
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,778
average you're missing the Target and so

347
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,338
this has been the key mantra for

348
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,559
precision AG how do we manage

349
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,180
variability well you can only manage

350
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,000
what you can measure so the key question

351
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:56,519
is how do you measure variability and

352
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,860
once you measure it then how do you

353
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,399
manage variability and so that's that

354
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,500
has been a lot of work in my in my lab

355
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,958
along with several other

356
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,299
um around the nation and the world this

357
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,939
is one of the fields that we did a lot

358
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:15,120
of grit soil sampling so we went out

359
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,760
with a coarser grid this work one work

360
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,799
was done in 97 98 99 I'm kind of dating

361
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,740
myself this is bear with me this this

362
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,719
led to development of a lot of signs so

363
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,139
in one field those three years we went

364
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,420
out and did a coarser uh sampling

365
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,560
and then in one part of the field we

366
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,679
said well

367
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,958
um let's do a finer grade sampling so we

368
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,698
went out and sampled very intensively

369
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,979
and the final were saying you're taking

370
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,879
all the top soil away to your lab you

371
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,180
know

372
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:48,659
we did so much sampling there and just

373
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:51,479
like any Precision practitioner you

374
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,278
first want to estimate the spatial range

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,039
or the distance at which there's a

376
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,578
correlation versus no correlation it

377
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:03,419
turns out that for this sampling the

378
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:07,619
spatial range happens to be 15 meters

379
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:08,699
okay and that will require 2500 soil

380
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,279
samples

381
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,558
to accurately capture this is nitrogen a

382
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,500
lot of our work is with nitrogen to

383
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,599
accurately capture distribution of

384
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,818
nitrogen in the surface soil that

385
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,759
require 2500 salt samples now how many

386
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,678
of you students will sign up for that

387
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:29,279
let alone Farmers or practitioners it's

388
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,759
it's unteenable and the Nugget effect is

389
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,160
so bad that for all the sampling we did

390
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:37,640
here

391
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,640
amounted to nothing

392
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,220
you cannot interpolate now there are a

393
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,019
lot of softwares out there you click

394
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,419
click click we'll crop create the

395
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:48,960
surface that has no technical Merit

396
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,460
okay and so there was a book that our

397
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,798
good colleague and friend Margaret

398
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,140
Oliver and Ruth Carey edited I have a

399
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,558
chapter in there and in the very opening

400
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,960
chapter Margaret says well for you to do

401
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,599
accurate prediction you not only have to

402
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,298
measure variability at the spatial range

403
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,219
you have to do that at half the spatial

404
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,079
range

405
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,120
so that's an exponential function if you

406
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,178
pull out your calculator it's a 55

407
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:18,418
hectare field you do the math now we're

408
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:21,919
talking about seven meter by seven meter

409
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,240
how many salt samples now

410
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,460
exactly it's an exponential function

411
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,859
it's ten thousand soil samples before

412
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,220
you do that so we learned it really

413
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,379
quickly that look it's labor intensive

414
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,740
time consuming and not economically

415
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,480
affordable we need an alternate we need

416
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,599
an alternate that can accurately

417
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,079
quantify variability without without

418
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:49,079
those parameters so and yet throughout

419
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,879
my journey in my Precision act world uh

420
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,038
we want something that's diagnostic so

421
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,500
grit fall sampling is diagnostic okay

422
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,839
but it's destructive

423
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,380
okay and time consuming labor-intensive

424
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,599
cost prohibitive and must be deployed at

425
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,419
spatially dependent scales if you want

426
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,240
to have meaningful outcomes okay so it

427
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,400
become it became very very hard and

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,798
that's exactly what led to us writing

429
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,160
the proposal in 1999 that was funded

430
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,918
partly by NASA and and USDA there used

431
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,840
to be an initiative called ifas so my

432
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,640
lab was one of them that got that

433
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,759
funding for a million dollars which used

434
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,000
to be a lot at that time still is today

435
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:33,119
and so four of my PhD students worked on

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,220
developing four different techniques of

437
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,379
management zones

438
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,558
so they um

439
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,419
they worked on looking at so many

440
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,000
different ways how do we capture

441
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,600
variability employing remote sensing

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,279
virtual imagery topography Farmers

443
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,519
experience at in those days we didn't

444
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,038
have access to 10 years of yield map uh

445
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,139
and and so and this became a commercial

446
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,058
product there's a company called

447
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,940
Centennial AG that was the first one

448
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,678
that embraced it and then iterations of

449
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,840
this was picked up everywhere in the

450
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,600
union and north of the border Canada

451
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,159
uses it and so many other places as a as

452
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,339
our work has taken

453
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,558
so uh we need a data collection at high

454
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,019
spatial densities that has been our

455
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:23,220
question and how do we address that so

456
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:26,160
fast forward this is 2012. I

457
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,980
had a quarter of a quarter section okay

458
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,419
so quarter section is 160 Acres so we

459
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,759
have a quarter of a quarter section that

460
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,160
was forwardgated I got some money from

461
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,819
my endowment and I said I'm going to put

462
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,740
in a Precision pivot systems okay so

463
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,139
this still exists and this is one of our

464
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,079
site where we continue to do Works uh

465
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,660
work and so the system that we built

466
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,240
here is the Precision Irrigation System

467
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,919
one of the very first ones at that time

468
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,880
in the country

469
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,320
that has drop nozzles five feet apart

470
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,600
and you can change the rate of

471
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,558
application of water at every nozzle

472
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,918
level

473
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,918
okay so mathematically speaking you have

474
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,440
five thousand plus management pixels

475
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,880
right and here's the drop nozzle that

476
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,580
you can change the rate of application

477
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,860
at every nozzle level and you can

478
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,500
actuate that at every two degrees of

479
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:22,859
pivot movement you do the quick map and

480
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,839
so that's 5400 mathematical Water

481
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,639
Management zones and this is where I

482
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,678
have said in my papers as well the

483
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,659
technology is ahead of science this is

484
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,440
the technology I'm working with where is

485
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,440
my decision map

486
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,460
and we're still working on this today

487
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,079
where's my decision map does it even

488
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,400
make sense to be applying differential

489
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,418
rates of water just because I have

490
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,038
technology right okay and then there are

491
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,659
so many unknowns we does it even make

492
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,879
sense to apply differential rate I just

493
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,100
said that how do we figure out how much

494
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,059
water to be applied in each zone or in

495
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:59,038
each pixel how many zones are ideal uh

496
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:01,619
do these Zone chains do they change

497
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,798
every season or every time you actuate

498
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:06,779
your pivot or lateral okay how often

499
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,220
does that change how much does it change

500
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:12,720
and how often

501
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,538
and how do I measure if I have the tool

502
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,819
to manage

503
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:20,519
my management pixel is five feet by five

504
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,899
feet roughly right it's a quadrilateral

505
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,720
it's not a square

506
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,298
and so how do I measure so that Quest

507
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,100
before it was only for nitrogen then we

508
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,019
started to be dabbling with water water

509
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,019
and nitrogen go together I've always

510
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,879
worked at irrigated systems okay and so

511
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,279
we said how do we measure that

512
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,440
you'll go back to the drawing board you

513
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,558
go out send your students out to measure

514
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,320
with TDR soil moisture on the surface

515
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,538
soil calculate that this is their

516
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,980
spatial dependence and based on that

517
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:55,259
this field this is a 22 acre pivot

518
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,659
needed 84

519
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,640
sensing nodes

520
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,740
so I wrote a proposal to John Deere John

521
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,000
Deere was in used to be in water systems

522
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,359
at that time I see I said I need 100

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,359
sensing nodes

524
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:13,440
in my system they said you guys are

525
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,820
crazy you said well we know it but we

526
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,000
still need to do it

527
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,980
okay because I need to be able to

528
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,319
quantify so this is wireless sensor node

529
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,599
uh John Deere gave us about 10 or 12

530
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,639
such systems we later have partnership

531
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,859
with heartau and they gave us some more

532
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,159
systems we couldn't do this work and

533
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,839
imagine 10 foot tall pole in these many

534
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,559
locations in the field farmer is going

535
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,558
to love you right

536
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,798
this is not the way to go and each

537
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,740
sensor node is about three to five

538
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:47,639
thousand dollars in 2012.

539
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,700
okay we we did this work on one half of

540
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,980
the field okay and bless his heart uh uh

541
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,960
dongwei he was a visiting scholar

542
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,480
postdoc in my lab and he was looking for

543
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,538
a project he got excited I can do this

544
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,419
so he went out with access to to measure

545
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:04,679
soil moisture every week sometimes twice

546
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,140
a week

547
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,500
to quantify how much was in the profile

548
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,080
at five death and Louis LED this work uh

549
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,419
we we established spatial and temporal

550
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,658
variability and there were some key

551
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,340
messaging this was so good for the

552
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,620
irrigation company

553
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,619
that there has to be dynamic Water

554
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:29,879
Management Zone each time

555
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:32,459
you actuate your pivot okay in fact the

556
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,740
Zone could change because pivot may take

557
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,620
two and a half three or five days to go

558
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,960
around the entire field okay so the

559
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:43,379
challenge was how do we measure soil

560
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,538
moisture in situ non-destructively at

561
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,059
spatial dependent skills and why just

562
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:51,000
water why not other parameters as well

563
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:53,399
and lo and behold five years back John

564
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,460
Deere came out with this spray CN spray

565
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,759
that you can act to it any nozzle so now

566
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,860
again your management is like two feet

567
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,538
by two feet

568
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,759
and how many senses would it take to

569
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,740
measure and we're talking diagnostic

570
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,140
measurement not surrogate measure like

571
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,500
remote sensing or sensor based

572
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,820
and so this challenge has been uh

573
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,700
something that we have been trying to

574
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:21,058
address okay we want high spatial

575
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,220
density diagnostic rapid and expensive

576
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,918
in fact that became part of the chapter

577
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,480
uh that I co-authored at the National

578
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,360
Academy of Sciences science

579
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,759
breakthroughs 2030 report that was

580
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,699
presented to Congress in 2018.

581
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,140
and um we said okay could we try that

582
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,640
with sensors so I'm going to show you

583
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,220
some of the work that Louis did while he

584
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,259
was in my lab we said how about we go to

585
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,778
the sensor route okay look at

586
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:48,839
inexpensive sensors can we do that right

587
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:51,419
it's diagnostic high spatial density and

588
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,000
so forth so there's a company out of

589
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,159
France reached out to us this used to be

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,679
a forty thousand dollar sensor they said

591
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,840
well we'll present it to you for you

592
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,400
know for for nitrogen purposes at that

593
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,619
time they were only selling this to

594
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,440
Vineyards to measure the phenolic

595
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:10,019
component of the grapes for high quality

596
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,240
wines we said okay let's give it a try

597
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,400
and and we came up with the idea how

598
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,220
about we measure Optical properties

599
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,080
using fluorescence in soil

600
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,120
I said well does it even make sense so

601
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,678
he did some literature review on lo and

602
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,558
behold there was literature to back it

603
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,480
up so that's exactly what what he did so

604
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:29,278
it's a multiplex fluorescent sensor

605
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,339
there are four induction channels

606
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:35,759
ultraviolet and RGB and there are three

607
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:37,918
detection channels so your output is 12

608
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,960
different parameters

609
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,538
and of course you can create your own

610
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,960
ratios to come up even more

611
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:49,980
it's actuated at 400 Hertz

612
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,980
and so in every second of your work it

613
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,620
generates a lot of data points you use

614
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,140
it for one second it's just both loads

615
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,239
of data okay the longer you work with it

616
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,440
it's just you're collecting data data

617
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:07,019
and more data okay and so uh he went out

618
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,240
to the field came up with a randomized

619
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,359
sampling design this is Louis working

620
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:17,159
with the Prototype newer version a lot

621
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:19,500
lighter newer version uh and it was in a

622
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,020
bucket he he's very good at fixing

623
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,359
things together and he walked the entire

624
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,179
field that's what he did okay

625
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,798
and so that's a closer shot uh how he

626
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,840
was doing that and so he walked

627
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,720
everywhere and was collecting uh for

628
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:36,000
several seconds what else we did we we

629
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,400
took soil samples from there so he took

630
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,278
it out in the field and then we dried it

631
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,380
created a uniform pattern and then had

632
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,599
our student help us out with that we did

633
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,240
this work for for uh three years there

634
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,000
were nine sites that's Tawny after

635
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,460
drying it she's working in the lab ready

636
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,259
to shine or fluoresce the soil and and

637
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,840
take measurements there in the

638
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:02,819
laboratory so this these are our samples

639
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,459
visually speaking I I can't see a whole

640
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,460
lot of difference other than color

641
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,919
and this is this data sat with us for a

642
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,079
long time because it was hard to figure

643
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,140
out what can we do

644
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,579
we recently hired a postdoc who has

645
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,679
machine learning and artificial

646
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,778
intelligence competencies and he was

647
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,580
looking at the data and so I'm going to

648
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:24,179
draw an analogy here

649
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,079
um

650
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:30,538
and so how do we deploy machine learning

651
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:34,079
I've had a big extension appointment so

652
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:37,798
I tried to break it down here so we said

653
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,538
okay how do Google uh you know or these

654
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,339
cameras work right what do they do

655
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:43,319
they're training the cameras all the

656
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,480
time you're taking so many pictures so

657
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,240
I'm going to pick up one of the global

658
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,519
celebrities how about Bill Gates okay so

659
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,058
everybody can can recognize Bill Gates

660
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:57,538
so here's Mr gaze with the same uh you

661
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:59,819
know glasses and similar looking uh

662
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:01,558
sweater and you tell the computer hey

663
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,839
that's Bill Gates okay that's Bill Gates

664
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,879
that's Bill Gates but here he changes

665
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,339
his his orientation and the sweater

666
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,100
changes you tell the computer hey this

667
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,619
is also Bill Gates right and he may lose

668
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,379
the sweater okay he may look different

669
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,359
right so what we're trying to do we're

670
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,700
trying to train the computer and that's

671
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,339
one of the fallacies we have that we

672
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,960
need lots and lots of data to first

673
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,298
train the computer and that doesn't

674
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,640
exist in agriculture right now how many

675
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:33,179
iterations do I have for the pivot for

676
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,399
me to train the machine so that it can

677
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,380
go into the predictability so what

678
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,959
happens he loses the sweater his

679
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,960
orientation changes and you're mixing it

680
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,940
with different ages of Mr Bill Gates can

681
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,798
the computer still recognize it it makes

682
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,320
mistakes you know Google makes lots of

683
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,700
mistakes you know that right and it gets

684
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,980
more and more complex he's getting

685
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,259
younger the you know the pattern behind

686
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,298
changes he loses the sweater as well as

687
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:59,339
the jacket what happens now what it

688
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,200
recognize what happens if it gets very

689
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,740
younger

690
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,019
right can it it's still accurately

691
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,579
identify and then if you do enough

692
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,980
learning

693
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,778
can it now predict how it's going to

694
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,519
look next

695
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,640
and that's exactly what we're trying to

696
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,639
chase that if I train the pivot and the

697
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,620
sensors enough so that the sensor can

698
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,960
look the information ahead of the pivot

699
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:27,658
feed that information on the edge

700
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,579
computer and send the decision mag back

701
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,380
to the pivot so I can apply the right

702
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:34,859
amount of water at the right place at

703
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:37,559
the right time right our our USD a goal

704
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:40,319
by 2050 is to cut down our water

705
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:43,139
footprint by 50 percent

706
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,778
I'm in Kansas sitting on Ogallala

707
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,580
last year alone it depleted two feet the

708
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,659
report came out last week it depleted

709
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,099
two feet

710
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,740
so it's not going to stay there forever

711
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,719
last year was a very dry year

712
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,319
okay so how do we do that and what

713
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,319
happens here

714
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,759
who is this

715
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,500
thank you so there is no no substitute

716
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,440
for human intelligence this is Steve

717
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,200
Jobs it turns out Mr Gates used to look

718
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,399
like him too back then

719
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,100
laughs

720
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,199
and what happens if I look at the

721
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,778
comparison

722
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,778
it requires a lot of training now this

723
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:23,880
is only the visual element right the

724
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,500
difference is only visual element that

725
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,620
I'm trying to make it very easy here

726
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,778
okay and it gets very complex and what

727
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:33,239
happens here I mean those two are very

728
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:35,339
different looking individuals so will

729
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,500
the machine perform what we're training

730
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,859
it to do and about soil soils are simple

731
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,859
right

732
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:47,099
It's mighty challenging trying to train

733
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,440
the signals coming from soil not just

734
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:52,319
physical property but also chemical

735
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,960
property uh to see okay what can we

736
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,778
learn from those iterations so here's

737
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,419
the data set he averaged it uh this is

738
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:03,119
the bunker he averaged the data and so

739
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:06,778
now you have that many predictions so 12

740
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:10,199
channels plus some more modified indices

741
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:11,880
and then you are basically running uh

742
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,620
mapping in multi-dimension right that's

743
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,880
what you're trying to do

744
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:19,979
okay and um you start looking at what

745
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,559
are significant relationship we picked

746
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,159
up three or four of those based on that

747
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:29,460
he parceled 70 of the data to train the

748
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,559
model okay and then he used 30 of the

749
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,778
data to test the model

750
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:38,639
so training R is 0.91 R is 0.57 one of

751
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:40,980
the things we realized that the fields

752
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,620
where we were doing sampling had very

753
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,140
low nitrogen parts per million and so we

754
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,599
did a better job with low and the model

755
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,940
really stinks as you get into higher

756
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,278
parts per million okay so again it based

757
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,140
on what we are training the model to

758
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:55,859
perform right

759
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,480
um

760
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,959
so

761
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,480
um what can we do next

762
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,980
if one day we're successful and there

763
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,440
are many Laboratories that are trying to

764
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,839
resolve this challenge okay if we're

765
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,140
successful we can have an unknown soil

766
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:15,898
sample use some kind of Technology you

767
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,759
know I'm not endorsing any and then you

768
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:20,639
do go through the optimum feature

769
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,460
selection have a train a model then the

770
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,620
regression you have a soil estimate and

771
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,079
you go to the end recommendation I want

772
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:30,239
to caution you it requires huge amount

773
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,819
of data for the training purposes your

774
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,519
results is only going to be as good as

775
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:37,740
what you can train it but you can

776
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,599
collect data in high spatial density uh

777
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,538
it used to be 40 Grand I think it's now

778
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,459
down to 19 000. okay so the more such

779
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:47,640
and there have been improvements in

780
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,519
inversion uh diagnostic no this is also

781
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,740
a surrogate measure rapid

782
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,740
a person has to go out I mean you can

783
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,140
mount it on a on a machine uh but uh

784
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,140
this unit right now

785
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,538
fails miserably in motion

786
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,740
okay so person has to walk over their

787
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:08,699
actuate fluorescence and then move on

788
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,159
inexpensive no

789
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,559
uh data processing and Analysis this

790
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,500
requires high amount of skill labor okay

791
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:19,858
so this has been our Quest that how do

792
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,500
we get spatial high density rapid and

793
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:24,418
inexpensive and so uh this is again

794
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,139
Louis and Rafael out in the field

795
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:31,079
sampling our our best technology that's

796
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,480
affordable uh is out there make a soil

797
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,500
solution and do a nitrate nitrate test

798
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,260
check

799
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,780
okay it's more qualitative and

800
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,240
quantitative or there's a lock one meter

801
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,980
that gives you uh you know in parts per

802
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,678
million okay

803
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,699
so that's that's what it is right

804
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:54,599
now talking with Engineers uh they say

805
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:56,279
hey we can measure this and so you have

806
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,900
a reference electrode and a working

807
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,920
electrode and you have got a power

808
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,300
circuit and reader if we can identify a

809
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,760
working electrode that can measure

810
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,220
nitrates and soil solution you dip it

811
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,859
and you test it out against different

812
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:13,618
molar Solutions and the response to

813
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:16,219
voltage is fairly good and as you change

814
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,720
the molarity of the you know nitrate

815
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:21,059
sodium nitrate

816
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,480
it gives you a stair step so that's an

817
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:27,900
aha moment can we translate that into a

818
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,300
very inexpensive nitrate sensor that can

819
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,059
measure nitrogen distribution in soil

820
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,420
and high spatial densities diagnostic

821
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:38,338
rapid and expensive uh destructive

822
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,619
involves labor time consuming if you

823
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,420
have to go out and do it yourself and

824
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:45,059
that's exactly what I was referring to

825
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,039
the science breakthroughs report that I

826
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,299
was part of part of at National

827
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,639
Academies

828
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,700
and if you read the chapter

829
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,858
it mentions that this ought to happen if

830
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:57,480
we want to go to the next level of

831
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,440
precision management it says it out

832
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,199
right there

833
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,539
and for us to become competitive in The

834
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,279
Proposal world we added three more

835
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,800
things when we wrote this proposal to

836
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,300
arpa e we said our sensor will be

837
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,180
battery less

838
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,460
it will be passive and we'll build it on

839
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:16,078
a biodegradable material

840
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,199
we didn't know what we were signing up

841
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,300
for we got the you know we got the Grant

842
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,699
and I was making this presentation at

843
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,700
the Western Governors uh Forum annual

844
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,980
Forum in Las Vegas and I was making a

845
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,379
point that I need sensors and I can

846
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,440
literally distribute it out in the field

847
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,900
that are inexpensive and so forth and

848
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,119
then I ran into an engineers and we can

849
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,480
do this you know what we can actually

850
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,579
print the sensors for you

851
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,780
we are doing this in our in our lab I

852
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,359
said really

853
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,400
and so said okay so that became the Holy

854
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,980
Grail then last four years we have been

855
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,660
working my lab with UC Boulder material

856
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,000
scientists at UC Berkeley Computer

857
00:36:54,659 --> 00:37:00,559
Engineering and beer scientists to

858
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,239
develop biodegradable printed sensors

859
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:07,619
and you literally print it on a screen

860
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,539
print okay and so you have um you have a

861
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,579
reference electrode you have insulating

862
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:13,920
layer of course this is how once you

863
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:17,339
have the screen made that's how you

864
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,200
print it on a conductive ink I gave this

865
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:22,078
very detailed presentation at the last

866
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,239
American society Agronomy meetings and

867
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
you you can literally print it and then

868
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,779
once you have the electrodes that

869
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,618
matches up you can dip it into the

870
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:34,380
solution to start measuring okay the

871
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,660
first prototype is eight of these

872
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,358
sensors are in the greenhouse testing

873
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,699
going on right now uh we have been

874
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,319
developing nitrate as well as soil

875
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:47,219
moisture sensor that that are being

876
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,440
printed okay and I'll uh so this is you

877
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,000
know version zero right and of course

878
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
we're using a circuit board because

879
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,820
we're far away from degree degradable

880
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,980
sensor so if you're successful our idea

881
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,660
is that we'll have a degradable material

882
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,539
okay that will print the circuit and the

883
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:08,759
electrode directly on it it can be done

884
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:10,920
conceptually it can be done it proves

885
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,740
okay the sensor works fine for two or

886
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,820
three days in lab conditions

887
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:20,338
okay but it fails miserably it has been

888
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,800
lasting right now we are Beyond two

889
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:25,980
weeks it's working okay

890
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,740
okay the nitrate is is really finicky

891
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,139
okay so it has some of those properties

892
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:34,739
reliable I will not go that far

893
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:37,858
okay it's it drifts uh inexpensive

894
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,779
battery less passive also

895
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:42,719
um we are we're decoupling the

896
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,760
biodegradable element if we can just get

897
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,379
a nitrate sensor that works that are

898
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,540
inexpensive you can print it I think

899
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,660
that will be a win and accuracy and

900
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:53,820
precision are are again there's so many

901
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:56,460
Hoops that we have to jump

902
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,160
um that that we're not there yet we went

903
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,500
through a lot of material testing where

904
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,480
we did accelerated degradation we'll put

905
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,358
in harsh environment put it on the

906
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,000
Shaker for 24 hours that I don't know

907
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,039
what the sensors will experience in the

908
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,019
soil what happens if the plow goes right

909
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,119
through or before detail goes right

910
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:18,059
through what happens to the sensor we

911
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,720
did that we also continuously are doing

912
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:23,578
uh fuel studies in the greenhouse with

913
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:26,039
different materials when you use

914
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:29,280
different soil types sand versus peat

915
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:31,259
versus uh clay the performance and the

916
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,359
drifting of the sensor happens big time

917
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,640
there are lots of oops to be jumped you

918
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,460
can imagine and then we keep taking

919
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:40,679
destructive samples to see at different

920
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,019
time frames at how the sensors or the

921
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,419
sensor materials are behaving they don't

922
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,219
behave so well now we do want these

923
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,159
sensors to fail at some point of time

924
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,838
but our time Target is 200 days so you

925
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,759
distribute these sensors out in the

926
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,980
field you don't have to go back and

927
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,920
collect them okay and then they break

928
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,719
down and they go you can tell we won't

929
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,639
get rich selling these sensors because

930
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,838
our Target price is like you know a few

931
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,519
pennies

932
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,039
okay you can just print them print them

933
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,960
print them right but the money is not in

934
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,599
the sensor the money is in the data

935
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,338
because you know farmer won't invest I

936
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,200
could imagine practitioners go out and

937
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:19,019
embed the field with sensor technology

938
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:22,500
and then you're collecting data in X and

939
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:24,780
Y and Z depth and time T so you're

940
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,358
working with multi-dimensional data set

941
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,119
it'll require a lot of machine learning

942
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,338
and AI algorithms for us to get to the

943
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,820
decision map we have been publishing all

944
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:37,380
along uh in in some good journals what

945
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,900
we are we are learning

946
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,900
we did a lot of dummy sensor field

947
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,180
testing uh with different because it has

948
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,880
to be encapsulated so that the sensor

949
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:50,239
don't degrade before we want it a lot of

950
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,519
a lot of grunt work is has been going on

951
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,979
uh lots of successes tremendous amount

952
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,039
of failures I can tell you right now uh

953
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,679
this is not easy and how the sensor same

954
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,559
sensor behaves in different soil types

955
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,719
we're very cognizant of that we're not

956
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,940
close to where we could be moisture

957
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,879
sensor from our learning we're uh we're

958
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,619
a little bit closer than uh we are for

959
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,320
the nitrate sensors you start with the

960
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,420
biodegradable material you etch it with

961
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,420
this stencil then you fill it with the

962
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,760
conductive ink you etch the conductive

963
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,159
ink again so that it can conduct

964
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,660
whatever signal we're trying to do and

965
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,118
it becomes conductive and that's where

966
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:32,039
we add a couple of wires so that now we

967
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,740
can communicate with that and then you

968
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,960
encapsulate that with a vax coding if

969
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:40,578
the video still works it's a good one

970
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,579
this one of my co-pis

971
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,420
this is the balsa wood substrate right

972
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,579
we print on right so we put a stencil on

973
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,220
top right the shape of the the electrode

974
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:52,980
pattern right right and then we we use

975
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,719
just a blade to coat through this

976
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,219
stencil pattern and the ink is right

977
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,078
here we use an ink like this yeah

978
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,838
exactly uses zinc ink and when you do

979
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,359
that and when we do that we get a we get

980
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,858
a uh we get a electrode pattern that

981
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,719
prints on the balsa wood that looks like

982
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,219
that made of the zinc correct but it's

983
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,500
not conductive because we have to make

984
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:12,539
it conductive so we dip it into a

985
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,280
solution of acetic acid correct which

986
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,759
etches the zinc oxide layer correct

987
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,380
makes it conductive then we attach wires

988
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,520
um

989
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,380
to be able to communicate with it to

990
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,599
interact with it we use a you know like

991
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,640
an epoxy to do that we connect the wires

992
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,160
and you use this mold and then we use a

993
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,500
mold and in the mold though we then coat

994
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,940
the wax we have to be very careful like

995
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,320
a lot of the trick in this is coating

996
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,079
the wax and making sure there's no

997
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,180
cracks like you can see it's a very good

998
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,480
wax code correct um and so that's string

999
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:44,098
and that is basically a complete sensor

1000
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,380
right go closer I will see the

1001
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,180
communication wires yeah so we can

1002
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,099
connect these obviously to electronics

1003
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,500
and then ultimately in the future we'll

1004
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,140
just connect them to a RFID so the first

1005
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,579
prototype may look something like this

1006
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,838
is missing the board right now missing

1007
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,980
the electronics board which will go

1008
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,599
there so these there'll be an

1009
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,358
Electronics board here which will do

1010
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,480
Wi-Fi communication okay these two wires

1011
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,279
will connect to that board and then this

1012
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,199
will go in the soil right up to about

1013
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,880
there to make measurements right and um

1014
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,219
that'll be what our first and we can

1015
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,220
program it such that it can record at

1016
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:20,159
any frequency we choose yes yeah within

1017
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:23,399
reason yeah okay excellent thank you

1018
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:26,399
so it doesn't have any battery okay we

1019
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,559
we use a radio frequency wave the sensor

1020
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,500
is sleeping all the time we wake it up

1021
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,599
for a millisecond it does the work soil

1022
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,760
solution around it measures it sends the

1023
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,760
signal and we record it and as many

1024
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,079
times as we actuate it it provides sorry

1025
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,079
also would Subs right right

1026
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,619
um are our vice president of research

1027
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:48,719
office did a cover story on the work

1028
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,519
that we're doing there I don't know how

1029
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,039
they took this picture but it's a pretty

1030
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,519
good looking picture of of this this is

1031
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,920
just a starting point for uh sensor node

1032
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:01,139
setup that we have we always measure it

1033
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,760
with commercial sensor to see how well

1034
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,098
the commercial sensor is performing

1035
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,040
against our sensor Network you always

1036
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,000
grow plant on it just want to make sure

1037
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,159
when you do these kind of things

1038
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,380
commercial vendors reach out to you say

1039
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,139
hey we have figured this out by the way

1040
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,818
would you like to test do that so we

1041
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,900
created a test bed there's a company out

1042
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:21,000
of Finland

1043
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,559
that reached out to us apparently they

1044
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,900
have been following our work for the

1045
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,818
last 20 years and

1046
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,440
um they said well we will give you those

1047
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:30,420
sensors these are battery powered

1048
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,159
sensors they're very small but the

1049
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,659
battery will last 20 years because the

1050
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,460
sensor is sleeping all the time it's

1051
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:38,039
non-degratable and stuff so we did

1052
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,199
create a test bed at the North Farm this

1053
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,480
is this is the and we had to go through

1054
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:45,960
a bunch of Hoops in order for the them

1055
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,119
to be uh pinged and data to be read so

1056
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,119
here's the base station solar powered

1057
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,780
Wi-Fi module in these rows are where we

1058
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,240
had 24 sensors in a in a field size of

1059
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,359
like this room that that was our test

1060
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,699
bed uh that we did last year and so we

1061
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:05,400
actuated from our lab as and you can

1062
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:08,338
program it for frequency and then my

1063
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,619
postdoc wrote a a app that you can

1064
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,599
immediately can create a surface map or

1065
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,358
a heat map that as he calls it so this

1066
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,039
is a two-dimensional heat map and we did

1067
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,098
this at two depths

1068
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:24,259
okay so as many times as you actuate

1069
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,260
data and X Y and Z you can

1070
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:30,960
oops so you can have this that this is

1071
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:33,599
only for the surface for multiple times

1072
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,679
what happens with depth I don't know how

1073
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,900
to what weight should I give to uh six

1074
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,358
inches depth versus 24 inches depth

1075
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,639
versus 36 inches depth

1076
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,039
we don't know right now so there's a lot

1077
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,318
of unknowns this is this work that we

1078
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,539
have been doing for the last 10 15 years

1079
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:54,119
we go out and measure electrical

1080
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:56,940
conductivity so what my lab has been

1081
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,460
doing is till we don't have the sensors

1082
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,400
we don't need to wait to work with

1083
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:06,539
spatial temporal data set so in any

1084
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,639
given year we collect 30 some data

1085
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:12,179
layers and I'm just stacking it up right

1086
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,500
here to create that big data set

1087
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:15,139
and

1088
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,280
foreign

1089
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:21,480
machine learning

1090
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,280
employ some of the AI algorithms uh you

1091
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,780
know these are self-explanatory that

1092
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,819
what kind of data layers that you can

1093
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,319
collect all the way down to the yield

1094
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,039
map

1095
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,579
um

1096
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,800
and then help translate into your

1097
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:37,380
decision I don't even know what the

1098
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,519
relevance is or weight Matrix could you

1099
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,519
imagine the weight Matrix

1100
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:47,219
that which data layer has more weight in

1101
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:49,679
the decision

1102
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,598
and each each parameter

1103
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,159
I mean we were doing farming for for

1104
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,260
centuries

1105
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,500
right but we don't have this

1106
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,420
quantitative assessment of how it

1107
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,219
impacts our decision making and that's

1108
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,200
I've given some Keynotes on farming with

1109
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,459
data but there are a lot of questions we

1110
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,980
don't know there's a lot of graduate

1111
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,139
students here this is phds written right

1112
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,719
here what we we don't know what data not

1113
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,980
to collect because it doesn't matter so

1114
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,618
we're going out and collecting whatever

1115
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,119
we can lay our hands on okay or whatever

1116
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,920
the graduate student agrees to collect

1117
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,599
right

1118
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,400
um what kind of Biometrics or

1119
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,500
statistical Computing would be needed to

1120
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,720
understand relationship within and

1121
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,219
across these spatial temporal data set

1122
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,439
we don't know that

1123
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:34,078
uh what's a waiter sign and the road

1124
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,880
role right and how do we account for

1125
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,140
seasonal analysis gonna happen every

1126
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,000
year

1127
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:41,699
okay how do we ensure this is

1128
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,039
reproducible and reliable and honestly

1129
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:46,439
and this is this is the proposal we

1130
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,358
wrote to USDA and the title of the

1131
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,179
proposal is artificial intelligence for

1132
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:53,578
sustainability of Agriculture my role is

1133
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:54,659
water uh water and nutrients and then

1134
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,640
there are other groups that are looking

1135
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:59,279
at salinity and Pest Management and

1136
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:02,818
diseases uh it's a SAS grant that we

1137
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,160
have in motion right now uh and so I I

1138
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:07,079
my this list is very long

1139
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,179
what we don't know

1140
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,079
okay so we have graduate students who

1141
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:14,639
are working on it I can Envision that

1142
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,220
someday will get to a point that will

1143
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:21,598
have in-situ non-destructive rapid

1144
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:23,279
reliable inexpensive sensor Network that

1145
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,280
will be collecting data layers that will

1146
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,000
be feeding it along with other data sets

1147
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:33,240
Okay and then we'll employ machine

1148
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,960
learning and AI will keep the complexity

1149
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,719
to ourselves okay and it will be

1150
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,760
automated somehow but the decision power

1151
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,159
will still be in the hand of the farmer

1152
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,079
hey I don't like this decision I I want

1153
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,879
to put 20 pounds more no matter what

1154
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,240
you're you're telling me I'm gonna put

1155
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,740
20 pounds more and that's I think could

1156
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,500
be part of the solution I'm not saying

1157
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:58,979
this is the only solution that by 2050

1158
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,960
we can reduce our inputs nitrogen and

1159
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Water by 50 percent

1160
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,740
I'll welcome any questions thank you

1161
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,659
yes sir so you mentioned that this

1162
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,459
approach requires machine learning and

1163
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:12,719
artificial intelligence

1164
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,280
um but I was noticing in your

1165
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,799
illustrations especially in the first

1166
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,480
slide there's no human beings in these

1167
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
in these systems so I wonder if you

1168
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,619
could talk about what the role of human

1169
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,420
intelligence and human Farmers is in

1170
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,460
this Republic in this Paradigm so the

1171
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,079
question for those who are online the

1172
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,000
question is that

1173
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,300
um you're talking about a lot of ML and

1174
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,880
AI I did not see much human human

1175
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,920
intelligence and human intervention you

1176
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,059
cannot eliminate human

1177
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,818
well

1178
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,920
because I sure hope that we are not

1179
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:45,358
requiring all those data layers to be

1180
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,039
captured

1181
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,799
at some point in time we'll figure it

1182
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,900
out that I don't need to go out and

1183
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,519
measure soil moisture distribution at 30

1184
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,980
minute frequency just because weather

1185
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,659
data is recorded or 30 seconds whether

1186
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,639
data is recorded that way that I have to

1187
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:02,279
record soil moisture that frequency I

1188
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:04,259
don't know that we would like to you

1189
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,540
know and this is where the element of

1190
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:10,440
human intelligence come into play okay

1191
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:14,119
and as I said in the previous slide that

1192
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,119
we're not eliminating farmers

1193
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,920
so farmer will have the final

1194
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:21,479
decision-making process okay and that

1195
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,059
most likely will be happening on their

1196
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,980
smartphone or iPad or whatever interface

1197
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:28,078
that we'll be working with we don't want

1198
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:31,139
to overwhelm farmer or for that reason

1199
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:34,318
practitioner uh in the decision-making

1200
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:37,259
process we want to keep that simple keep

1201
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,960
the complexity to this group right here

1202
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,520
but uh I mean think about many of the

1203
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,920
technologies that have been successful

1204
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:47,880
and have been picked up

1205
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,960
were intentionally kept simple built on

1206
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,180
a very robust complex systems

1207
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,619
so we are never eliminating human

1208
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,598
intelligence

1209
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,180
yeah not in our life fans at least I

1210
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,039
know there's an AI chat GPT and so so

1211
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:04,980
many other things out there

1212
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,739
yeah good question though

1213
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,300
it's my question my question is how are

1214
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,219
you going to integrate this I mean you

1215
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,880
already have sensors out there called

1216
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:16,799
plants so at what point are you going to

1217
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,260
be integrating plant information into

1218
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,260
you know they're they're doing already

1219
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:24,599
the integration for you

1220
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,099
what's the link there so you're exactly

1221
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,859
right uh question is how are you

1222
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:31,619
integrating plants so our group is

1223
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,900
taking surrogate measures from crop and

1224
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,240
plant responses there are other groups

1225
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,200
like mine that are working on implanter

1226
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,118
sensors

1227
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,179
where they're you know you're using

1228
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,180
stickers to stick the sensors to the

1229
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:48,899
leaves uh zapping in electrodes to

1230
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:51,480
measure the sap content continuously

1231
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,039
there are several AI Institute that have

1232
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,099
been funded through NSF 20 million

1233
00:51:53,039 --> 00:52:00,480
dollar grant that are developing those

1234
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,579
implant a sensor for uh do exactly what

1235
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,260
we are doing here our Focus has always

1236
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,579
been on nitrogen water so that we're

1237
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,680
going to have to move away from actually

1238
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,480
putting things in plants and basically

1239
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,940
using animals that remote sensing but in

1240
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,519
a sense sort of the because you can't

1241
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:17,338
just keep putting sensors out there and

1242
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,500
you need to be able to have mobile maybe

1243
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:21,659
that'll happen I don't know maybe is the

1244
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,000
combination of things that will happen I

1245
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:28,980
do not know right now we're just trying

1246
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,619
and NASA in 2000 in the year 2000 they

1247
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:34,800
had an implant a sensor by the way I was

1248
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,680
looking at the NASA Innovation uh news

1249
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,480
report they tested that and they were

1250
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,480
measuring the turgor pressure of the

1251
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,039
plant and they programmed it to a cell

1252
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,838
phone that every time the turgor

1253
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,058
pressure was dropping you get a text

1254
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,818
message hey water me

1255
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:52,500
right so I mean there are some simpler

1256
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:55,079
technologies that are available it's

1257
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:58,260
just right now it's picking it up and it

1258
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:00,839
will involve a lot of frugal innovation

1259
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,640
because if you're trying to do it at

1260
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:04,920
high spatial densities

1261
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,259
uh you know even large Farmers can't

1262
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,420
afford it I'd like to see where the

1263
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,339
instrumentation gets tied into plant

1264
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,260
performance so you've got all this

1265
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:15,358
information about souls or climate and

1266
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,880
things like that but what is that

1267
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,558
implication for plant performance and I

1268
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,119
don't want you to carry this impression

1269
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,420
there is

1270
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,900
equal or larger body of work is being

1271
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:30,358
done with plant s sensors yeah if I did

1272
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,800
not cover that today so

1273
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,799
all right so foreign

1274
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:51,239
uh I would like to uh see what's your

1275
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:53,880
Envision on a big data management and

1276
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:56,459
regulation policies there's so much data

1277
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,160
has been you know going on creating

1278
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:02,179
how will it look like the access to

1279
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,980
these big data to the stakeholders

1280
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:07,139
practitioners public general public

1281
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,480
right the question has to do with the

1282
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:11,159
big data and the security and the

1283
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,679
ownership and how does that look like

1284
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,858
that that conversation is happening

1285
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:19,618
Nationwide right now we don't have a

1286
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:24,119
resolution on that or consensus on that

1287
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:25,680
at right now so farmer still owns the

1288
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,300
data because there are so many private

1289
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,940
companies that are collecting huge

1290
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,760
amount of data the the raw data is still

1291
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,800
owned by the data and the fine print

1292
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,079
says that the derivative in my

1293
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,500
understanding is that the derivative

1294
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,420
could be used for other purposes but not

1295
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,900
the direct data set

1296
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:49,500
just last week no this week Monday we

1297
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,200
visited a farmer who manages 43 000

1298
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,739
acres in Colby

1299
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:59,098
and and he has been collecting data for

1300
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:01,019
last 20 years and he was he was one of

1301
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:03,480
the rare Farmers he was very open to

1302
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:05,639
giving the data set if we can translate

1303
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,818
that into meaningful decisions I've not

1304
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:11,519
found a lot of farmers like that and and

1305
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:14,880
it goes into a cloud you know he's he

1306
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:16,500
was a John Deere customer and um of

1307
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,539
course the derivatives are being derived

1308
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,579
so that continuous Improvement whether

1309
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:22,500
it's machine performance or labor

1310
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,539
working in the field or not or pivot is

1311
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,760
is clogged or you know whatever that

1312
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:28,079
might be but we don't have a solution on

1313
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,359
the ownership if that's what you're

1314
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,180
getting at right now yeah

1315
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:36,779
all righty thank you very much Raj so

1316
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:39,299
another round thank you

1317
