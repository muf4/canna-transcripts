3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:12,379
hello everyone my name is Michael gore

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:14,599
I'm coming to you from this section of

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,730
plant breeding and genetics so the

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,439
question of the day well perhaps this

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,118
isn't a question today for you but it's

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,539
a question day for me that it will pose

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:25,910
to you is that how the mic or get into

10
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,070
high support phenotyping let me go back

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,339
to my days of being a graduate student

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,859
at work buckler's lab we had this

13
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:36,350
population of 5,000 recombinant inbred

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:40,249
lines called the maids NAMM population

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,129
and it took an army of people to plant

16
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:45,980
in an army of people to phenotype so

17
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:48,948
after all those countless days of having

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,748
to do plant height year high enter

19
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,428
flowering time out in the field I began

20
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:55,010
thinking of way to do high to predict

21
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:56,989
phenotyping one of the ways that we had

22
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:00,018
thought about doing - foot phenotyping

23
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:03,948
was perhaps having a plane fly over the

24
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:08,900
field which we had the other way was

25
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:11,269
having a large helium balloon tied to a

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,000
four-wheeler and pulled through the

27
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:17,539
field and a nice expensive camera

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,239
attached as well we began doing that and

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,740
driving back and forth through the field

30
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,619
but sometimes the wind would pick up and

31
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:26,479
there would be some tension on that line

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,189
it was a little scary but we were all

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,570
pretty sure that that line was strong

34
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:35,450
until one day it snapped and I remember

35
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:37,399
our field manager Nick calling the

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,980
police and asking them if they would

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:45,030
shoot the balloon out of the sky

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm so thankful for humanity that they

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,710
did not do that and for all we know that

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,210
cameras in Canada somewhere and it's

41
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:56,069
being used but thankfully I didn't allow

42
00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:01,709
my height uppity no typing dreams to

43
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:05,759
float away that fateful day so in in

44
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:10,590
2009 I accepted a position to work in

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,110
the USDA in Maricopa Arizona which was a

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,330
great decision on my part

47
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:19,320
but in the vironment was very harsh for

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,250
Huen and for growing plan but I kind of

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,019
viewed it as a test track for plants and

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:31,409
it's a great environment for testing for

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:34,080
heat and drought stress and I was hired

52
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:37,049
to work on cotton so coming from the

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,150
maize community and at that time working

54
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,990
on the first generation haplotype map of

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,939
maize realizing I was going to have to

56
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,850
dedicate my life to working out in the

57
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,659
field maybe the only people I would make

58
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,949
proud would probably be Marc's laurels

59
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:57,000
because I would actually go out to the

60
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:58,409
field what I didn't realize at the time

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,919
when it had my interview there in

62
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:05,069
January is it gets really hot and when

63
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,899
my family and I moved back out in June

64
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:11,370
there were so many four-letter words

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:14,340
drops that day but you know what we

66
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,469
adapt just like the plants but some of

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,599
the challenges such as when you think

68
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:22,709
about cotton trying to sustainably

69
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:25,560
produce it we in the face of global

70
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,349
climate change the patterns of weather a

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,920
highly variable right now and our

72
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,810
freshwater resources especially when I

73
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,139
was living in Arizona when we were

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,150
drawing down the Colorado River when you

75
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,238
actually see it firsthand it is quite

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,719
dramatic and here when we're looking at

77
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,140
the Cotton Belt right here of the US and

78
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,250
this was taken in 2011 here this is

79
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,229
where there

80
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,080
the co-occurrence of a severe drought

81
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,030
and just to have an idea of like the

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,820
economic impact of what a drought can

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,539
have this caused 2 billion of economic

84
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,729
loss in cotton production what is some

85
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,189
of the consequences of that we see it on

86
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:11,609
the news but really it's impacting human

87
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:15,479
beings and so when I was hired this is

88
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,100
kind of a charge that I Excel burdened

89
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,079
with that I felt I had to carry is how

90
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,970
are we going to turn that engine of

91
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,730
evolution and plant populations fast

92
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,160
enough to generate these resilient

93
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:30,210
cultivars to help provide fiber to the

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,520
world but also provide a source of

95
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:39,769
financial income to the farmers such as

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:43,199
this one in Garfield County Texas and in

97
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:46,289
2009 began thinking a lot about genomic

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,418
selection and of course you know we

99
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,300
could also think of recombination and

100
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,909
CRISPR cast 9 tying into a genomic

101
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,639
framework and the whole idea is how many

102
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,640
more generations can you turn per year

103
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,399
and so ideally this would result in

104
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,009
faster development of more resilient

105
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,839
crops and in this case cotton so of

106
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,909
course we have our training population

107
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,829
and we do genotyping and phenotyping on

108
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,800
that training population and to train

109
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:15,569
our GF model but phenotyping is still

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,030
very important because when you think

111
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,439
about the prediction accuracy highly

112
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:22,399
heritable phenotypes and high quality

113
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:29,310
phenotypes is what's driving a lot of

114
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:30,989
that GS model and so there's obviously a

115
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,000
lot of improvements that can be made to

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,639
these GS models where you know you're

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,649
training on a genotypic in phenotypic

118
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,349
data set and then you're trying to

119
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:42,299
predict the phenotype of a related

120
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,610
population that has been only genotype

121
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,360
and phenotype

122
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:52,110
in is what I decided to focus on at that

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,939
time back in 2009 but coming into it we

124
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,069
all knew that the classic genotyping as

125
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,889
I talked about earlier plant breeders

126
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,728
know how to do very well plant readers

127
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,218
are very industrious in a sense

128
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:07,550
Bilbo's hire an army and that's how they

129
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:09,800
get the job done but when you're working

130
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,419
in an environment such as Arizona which

131
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,569
has sometimes temperatures over 100

132
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:16,968
degrees Fahrenheit you need to work a

133
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:19,520
lot more intelligently or you won't last

134
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:22,939
very long in the field so there's a time

135
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,430
intensive component to it often if

136
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:27,770
you're doing plant physiological traits

137
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,168
the sample sizes are fairly small and

138
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:33,528
you can only do perhaps like a few time

139
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:35,359
points as well and often from a plant

140
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:38,749
breeding I

141
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,580
there's obviously trade bias in a sense

142
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,680
you tended only phenotype what you can

143
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,688
visually score or perhaps you're just

144
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,939
driving a combine at the end of the

145
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,740
season and when it comes to hiring a

146
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,199
large field crew that is also very

147
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,778
expensive

148
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,819
so this is my colleague here Mike salvo

149
00:06:53,778 --> 00:07:00,288
Qi and he introduced me to the like

150
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,240
horse 6400 I was all enamored with it at

151
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:04,579
first until I realized how much of a

152
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,278
pain it was having to work in that

153
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,588
intense heat and to realize you would

154
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,908
sit and maybe for a half an hour in

155
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,408
front of a couple plants and you

156
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:14,990
wouldn't really get that much phenotypic

157
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:16,759
data some of the phenotypic data that we

158
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,528
were able to get would be like

159
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,098
transpiration rate and cama to be

160
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:24,199
temperature and we also had a FLIR

161
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:26,149
camera that we could shoot in in front

162
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,848
of these and here this picture than a

163
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:33,079
pima cotton if you do not know what pima

164
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:35,269
cotton is it has nice long fiber and

165
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:40,459
that's what that high thread count

166
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:42,348
sheets that that you have but at that

167
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,819
time we were really thinking about how

168
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:46,158
do we do this a lot faster

169
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,680
it isn't that we're lazy we just want to

170
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,288
have very large population and we want

171
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,019
to be able to really cover all the

172
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:55,550
different developmental time points of a

173
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,740
plant as they are growing over the

174
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,588
growing season and we want to be as

175
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,848
objective of we can possibly be and we

176
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:08,509
want to do this at low cost so there was

177
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:09,610
an agricultural engineer that I began

178
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,658
talking to in

179
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,870
9 Pater njarraud 8 Sanchez and in a

180
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:19,930
sense we found this tractor in the

181
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,780
junkyard and it needed a new engine and

182
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,459
a new tires and everything so here I'm

183
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:27,908
showing I think at this time version

184
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,068
tree I'm sorry version 2 version 1

185
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:32,259
tractor high clearance tractor we just

186
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,570
pulled out of a junkyard put in a new

187
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:37,809
motor put some new tires on put this

188
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,740
tool bar arm and we're set to go so the

189
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:43,958
idea of sensor fusion is in a sense

190
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,889
combining all these different data

191
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:50,199
streams to be able to use them and get

192
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,720
as much information out of in terms of

193
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,089
trying to understand what is the crop

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,089
doing over these various time points of

195
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,640
a growing season and if you're imposing

196
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,440
in this case heat and drought stress and

197
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,009
some of the phenotypes that we were

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,170
focusing on first was a vegetation index

199
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:12,750
and that's focused up in here these are

200
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:15,338
called crop circles we had our T's on

201
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,470
the tractor as well and they are

202
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,779
pointing down over the the crop right

203
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,389
here and that's to do phenotyping of

204
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:25,269
canopy temperature and here we have the

205
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,309
ultrasonic transducers that's pointed

206
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:30,490
right here and that's what we were able

207
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:33,578
to do canopy height and we had our TK

208
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:36,070
GPS on the tractor so in essence we're

209
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:39,179
able to re resolve and D convolute all

210
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,800
these Expedia typic data points down to

211
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,169
individual plants in a plot and we're

212
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,828
able to do that entirely and repeatedly

213
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:49,569
over the growing season so the first leg

214
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:51,039
thing that you do kind of as a plant

215
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,060
breeder is think about okay we're able

216
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,919
to collect all this perhaps gigabytes

217
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:58,838
and terabytes of phenotypic data but is

218
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,088
it of value is it heritable is a

219
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,860
repeatable so one of the first things

220
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:06,579
that you know I basically want to do is

221
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,220
here we were testing this on 25 Pima

222
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:12,629
cultivars and here we have on the y-axis

223
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,579
canopy temperature and on the x-axis

224
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:18,220
leaf relative water content and what

225
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:20,289
this is basically showing is this canopy

226
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,980
temperature is chapping with changes in

227
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:25,129
the soil

228
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,620
water relationship whereas the drive

229
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:29,600
plots have a higher canopy temperature

230
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,730
because the transpiration rate is

231
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,070
reduced of those plants because they're

232
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,289
trying to conserve water so the

233
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,670
transformation rate is shut down and in

234
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:40,399
turn the canopy temperature is

235
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:42,829
increasing and here in the blue or on

236
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,250
these would be and you can kind of view

237
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,850
them as control plots so these are the

238
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,970
well water wet plots and the

239
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,100
transpiration rate is high because these

240
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,379
plants aren't shutting down and they're

241
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:03,580
able to continue to cool the the crop

242
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:08,090
canopy and we had heard from Todd about

243
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:11,060
this vegetation index called NDVI which

244
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,040
ties in red and near-infrared and what

245
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:16,250
this is really typically doing its

246
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,339
innocence quantifying biomass but it's

247
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,559
also tying in leaf area index

248
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,649
chlorophyll content and coverage of the

249
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,899
actual plant canopy itself but what we

250
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:32,959
saw here over time of these 25 Pima

251
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:36,649
cultivars is the plots that are dry they

252
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,710
begin to decrease their NDVI value over

253
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:42,649
time and what this response was actually

254
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:45,950
capturing is the degree to which the

255
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,870
plants will because here you see a pima

256
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,600
cotton columns of artists under intense

257
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,509
drought and you can see the the leaves

258
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,029
will so this is a vegetation index that

259
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,269
is in a sense capturing greenness so as

260
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,309
the leaves droop there's more soil

261
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,259
exposed up through the canopy and also

262
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:05,659
as the leaves wilt they're changing

263
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,870
their conformation as well and that's

264
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:11,839
changing the pattern of leaf reflection

265
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,360
as well and that's why those values are

266
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,580
decreasing so this was like kind of a

267
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,120
fun way to see if you can plot this over

268
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:23,240
time within the actual day is capturing

269
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,850
biomass but in our eyes now we're able

270
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,220
to use it to see the degree to which the

271
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:33,769
plants actually wilt so we were able to

272
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,670
also see that this system was repeatable

273
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,939
over the growing season

274
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:41,588
assuming that the canopy was closed and

275
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,839
that's the drip irrigation was not

276
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,910
clogged because there are challenges

277
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,759
when you're growing on drip irrigation

278
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,919
and it is being cleared out right you

279
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,659
need to pump some sulfuric acid through

280
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,389
there and clean it up just right and

281
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:57,578
things again flowing very well but as we

282
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,438
saw is when we were doing its high

283
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:02,620
kickers phenotyping with the tractor we

284
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:04,719
could easily see parts of the field from

285
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,730
the response of the plants where the

286
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,410
drip tape was actually clogged because

287
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,269
those were the plants that were heating

288
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,730
up very fast and then you would just

289
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,350
pump into this also I'll tear gas and

290
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,649
clear it out and it cleans it up just

291
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,389
fine and so here we have the same high

292
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:21,039
clearance tractor system and here I'm

293
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,759
calling field Bates hydro flood plan

294
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:29,438
phenotyping system and it's QTL mapping

295
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:32,800
of different traits over time so if you

296
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:35,370
haven't thought about GTL in this sense

297
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,889
you can just think of a key TL as a

298
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,720
quantitative trait locus what innocence

299
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:45,250
is just a chromosomal region controlling

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,800
phenotypic variance in that part of the

301
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,740
genome so in a sense we have this

302
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,448
recombinant inbred line population up

303
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,448
close to 100 recombinant inbred lines

304
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:59,198
and these recombinant inbred lines are a

305
00:13:55,448 --> 00:14:01,508
mosaic of the two parents in a sense you

306
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,849
shuffle up the genome and then you're

307
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,970
using the patterns of recombination to

308
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,009
track these regions of the genome with

309
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,990
the phenotypic variation and if those

310
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,028
particular regions of the genome are

311
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,089
showing up that's what we're referring

312
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:18,338
to as a QTL so here we also have our

313
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,339
field base height spread phenotyping

314
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,230
system we did these various agronomic

315
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:26,680
traits such as lint yield both size and

316
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,019
private quality and thanks to Tim cetera

317
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,568
at the time we were also able to

318
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:34,179
phenotype a size like acid concentration

319
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:36,338
as a physiological leaf trait and as I

320
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:40,088
was saying this was all grown and drip

321
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:42,610
irrigation and we had a little Neutron

322
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,290
probe in the field which if you've ever

323
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,000
put these in you can feel our pain

324
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:47,279
because we

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,740
after duties readings every week before

326
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,709
and after turning on the drip irrigation

327
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,500
and the great thing about having a drip

328
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,509
irrigation you can have a set time so in

329
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,820
the sense the plants are almost trained

330
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:03,269
very well when you're turning on and off

331
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,210
the drip irrigation and this is a shot

332
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:10,919
of the actual field right here in

333
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:13,740
Maricopa Arizona so here what this is is

334
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,740
basically recapitulating a canopy

335
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,450
temperature heat map of the field and

336
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,789
each of these little circles or pixels

337
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,440
right here are an actual phenotypic data

338
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:26,819
point that was taken by the high

339
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,220
clearance tractor and so if you recall

340
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,110
we have these four IR TS on the tractor

341
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,480
so we're able to do phenotyping of four

342
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:39,629
rows at a time and the cooler the canopy

343
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,149
is the bluer it is and you see these

344
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:46,439
little areas are here those are our

345
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:50,338
alleys in the field here and so this is

346
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,320
a control treatment right here so here

347
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,570
would would be the the dry drought

348
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,850
treatment right here and here you can

349
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,910
see the the canopy temperature is

350
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,800
heating up but you can see this part of

351
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:04,799
the field right here is actually cooler

352
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,599
and when we ran in e/m 38 and checked

353
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,419
out the conductivity of the soil what we

354
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,089
had found out this part of the field had

355
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,799
a higher clay content and so if you do

356
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,540
any drought testing and if you do the

357
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,849
thing you should always understand is

358
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,870
there's more variation for the soil than

359
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,389
their actual traits that you're

360
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,419
phenotyping in your plant populations so

361
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:28,980
you have to control for this type of

362
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:31,529
field variation in your models or you'll

363
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,970
just end up being a breeder breeding for

364
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:39,899
soil type and you wouldn't be the first

365
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:42,269
one that has so the the great thing here

366
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,069
is that canopy temperature turned out to

367
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,649
be highly heritable in this recombinant

368
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,950
inbred line population and in this case

369
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:53,100
shows transgressive segregation and what

370
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,930
that transition actually means is you

371
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,639
have progenies that exceeds the

372
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,859
phenotypic values of

373
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,039
the actual parents and these are the two

374
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:06,449
parents here and I'm 24 of 16 and tm-1

375
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:09,379
and these are the control plots here wet

376
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,350
and these are the drive plots here in

377
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,299
red and you can see the control plots

378
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:20,099
here wet had a heritability broad sense

379
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:23,279
of 0.8 3 and this is heritability of 0.9

380
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,500
these carrot of building values

381
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,629
generally range between 0 and 1 and they

382
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,390
happen to be quite high here because one

383
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,950
thing to keep in mind we were doing

384
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,500
genotyping at three time points within a

385
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,390
single day so it's really taking in all

386
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,460
of that variance within the actual day

387
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,710
and that's helping to increase the

388
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,269
heritability of the phenotype itself and

389
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,759
since we have the trap there we can do

390
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:49,410
phenotyping over the entire growing

391
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,269
season here so if you ever and having

392
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,080
taught about cotton growing so here we

393
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:57,000
go from seed to perhaps eight nodes

394
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,849
four to five weeks out the first bloom

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,069
and then you have to add a defoliant to

396
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:05,039
force all of the leaves to fall off

397
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:08,099
because cotton is a poor in a perennial

398
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,428
tree just treat it as an annual crop

399
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,619
okay and and the great thing is you know

400
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:17,040
here's when the trials our planet we

401
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:19,500
have equal irrigation applied to both

402
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,450
the wet and dry treatment and these are

403
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,009
the phenotypes that we had targeted for

404
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,890
different time points so canopy

405
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:28,140
temperature canopy NDVI which does

406
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,830
remind use of vegetation index and then

407
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,110
canopy height and then we began opposing

408
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,298
the differential irrigation at flowering

409
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:38,490
because we didn't want confounding

410
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:42,720
because that's why we didn't do it early

411
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,160
on prior to flowering because also as a

412
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,539
few of you probably know often when

413
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,150
people are breeding for drought

414
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:50,849
tolerance it's actually drought escape

415
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,470
and the QTL can to be just genes for

416
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:55,619
flowering time and that's one thing that

417
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,750
we wanted to avoid and then at the end

418
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,369
of season we're driving like a cotton

419
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,640
picker through the field and harvesting

420
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:04,558
and so here what we have is canopy

421
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,750
temperature over the whole growing

422
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,139
season and then we were able to break up

423
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,880
these basically days

424
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,250
of the year into the different

425
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,049
developmental growth phases of cotton so

426
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,160
here we have flowering at peak bloom

427
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:22,829
full development and fiber development

428
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,640
in elongation this is at 7:00 in the

429
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:28,798
morning 10 a.m. 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and

430
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,020
the red here is a dry treatment and the

431
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,509
blue is the wet treatment here and what

432
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,269
you kind of see on this axis here this

433
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:40,410
is the canopy temperature here and as

434
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:42,779
you increase the temperature in terms of

435
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,360
Lake during the day the phenotypic

436
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,500
variance is also increasing as as well

437
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:52,558
as the plants are becoming more hotter

438
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,419
and and so when you think about this we

439
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,000
were able to now break up the plan into

440
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,549
the different development in all phases

441
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,279
and what we found is the canopy

442
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:04,379
temperature feeding pipes themselves are

443
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,899
more highly correlated with in a plant

444
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,020
growth stage so what's that's telling

445
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,870
you is they're somewhat maybe a

446
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:15,629
coordination of genes some itself within

447
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:18,359
an actual plant growth stage so then

448
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,919
this gave us the idea okay since we're

449
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,019
seeing these patterns what that may

450
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,200
suggest that the there is maybe certain

451
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,480
QTL in terms of their expression

452
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,910
patterns turning on and off in the

453
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,890
genome over the growth phase of the

454
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,410
cotton recombinant inbred line

455
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,309
population and some of that is perturbed

456
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:40,110
by heat and heat and drought stress and

457
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:43,019
in fact that is actually what we found

458
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,029
so here we have what we're revealing

459
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,548
here is this distinct temporal patters

460
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,529
of the QTL effects that's controlling

461
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:52,168
canopy temperature variation is

462
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:55,319
recombinant inbred line population so

463
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:58,799
this is the qtls that we detected under

464
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:01,109
the control wet treatment here these are

465
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,529
the Kentucky L that we controlled under

466
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:08,308
the dry treatment here and these are the

467
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:10,769
effects of the QTL that decrease canopy

468
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:14,730
temperature here they're in blue and in

469
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:17,339
the red our GTL accepts that in our

470
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,589
increasing canopy temperature but what

471
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:23,099
you can see here is depending on the age

472
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:25,109
of the actual plant that's when QT

473
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,949
are actually being triggered and turned

474
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:31,379
on and intensity if if you will the size

475
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,058
of the effect of the key TL is also

476
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,778
partly being driven by the drought

477
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:38,759
treatment and the great thing about a

478
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:41,609
genome is you can find any possible

479
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:45,720
candidate gene that you want so here in

480
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:48,479
in this region of the cotton genome

481
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,528
where we had a key TL map we found a

482
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,808
gene for an ABA response factor and one

483
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:58,169
of the the things that I found was

484
00:21:54,808 --> 00:22:01,109
pretty exciting at the time is that the

485
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:03,778
key TL for variability in cotton leaf

486
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:06,298
ABA content also mapped to that same

487
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:10,619
region of the genome and why that seems

488
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:14,700
to jive is in a sense when you have ABA

489
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:17,189
it's contributing to what the model size

490
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,190
and how its going to open and close

491
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:24,389
right so it's quite possible that this

492
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,940
QTL is in fact contributing to variation

493
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:29,758
in transpiration rate in this part of

494
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:34,070
the genome and that would obviously then

495
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:37,200
drive changes in canopy temperature and

496
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:39,028
dr. Du Polly contributed to this paper

497
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,210
and I believe he is here you can ask

498
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:44,099
them all about it and and so then we

499
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,620
also want to think about in terms of

500
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,808
breeding and when here on the x-axis

501
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,808
here we have lint yields and temperature

502
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:53,819
on the y-axis what we have found is you

503
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:55,859
know that increase in leaf transpiration

504
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,200
rate under drought stress actually

505
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,869
contributes to higher lint yield in a

506
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,169
heavily irrigated hot arid environment

507
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:06,449
so these plants over here are the ones

508
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:08,879
that take a risk under drought in a

509
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,308
sense they're not shutting down and

510
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:13,980
they're continuing to have a high

511
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:16,740
transpiration rate and by having that

512
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,089
they can continue to six-carbon and in a

513
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,419
sense have higher yield

514
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:23,849
these plants over here are the ones that

515
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,480
decide to shut down and they're going to

516
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:29,969
fix less carbon now right and so they

517
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,669
will yield less so in a heavily

518
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,110
irrigated environment such as Elle West

519
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,940
in Arizona you would perhaps

520
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,509
genotypes such as this one right here

521
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,558
but if you're in a dry land in

522
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:43,690
environment that's only rain said

523
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,879
perhaps you would want a genotype that's

524
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,880
more conservative over in this region

525
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,019
here and that will perhaps be calibrated

526
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:57,070
to use water only perhaps a like fill of

527
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:59,440
the grain or a flowering and what we

528
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,450
also found is at all these various time

529
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,909
points that we did phenotyping across

530
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,730
the field season the most informative

531
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:10,389
was at flowering because the reason why

532
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,038
is after you have all this heat what's

533
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:13,719
going to suffer in this case it's going

534
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,509
to be the flowers themselves so if

535
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,399
there's high heat the pollen isn't going

536
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:20,138
to be viable and if it isn't going to be

537
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:22,709
viable there isn't going to be seed set

538
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:28,888
and there isn't going to be any fiber

539
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:31,480
and so here it's a fun part with lidar

540
00:24:28,888 --> 00:24:33,699
work so you're putting this on our

541
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,730
tractor and now we're trying to recreate

542
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,649
the the 3d shape of the foliated cotton

543
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,798
plants in the field so this is our

544
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:45,129
entire field right here and this is one

545
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,658
say like 28 foot plot of defoliated

546
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,649
cotton plants and what you could see

547
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,570
here is all these cloud points and todd

548
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:56,308
was touching down clown points and his

549
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:58,388
talk and in a sense these are

550
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:00,970
recapitulating the actual cotton balls

551
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:03,398
on on the plants and we can actually

552
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,130
take out like a single plant and do a

553
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,888
euclidean clustering approach and

554
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,690
innocence try to get closer to yield and

555
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:12,849
we're here we're just counting the

556
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,149
cotton bowls on the plant so I think

557
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:19,000
there's a lot of future in that so now

558
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:21,398
let's turn to deep learning which we all

559
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,369
love and artificial intelligence

560
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:27,099
so since coming to Cornell's they're

561
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:29,079
working with some plant pathologists

562
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:32,199
which I found are exciting people to

563
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:37,079
work with and oh hey hey Chris how you

564
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:40,210
doing so one of the questions we had

565
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,928
here we have a phenotype that's caused

566
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,960
by this pathogen and it's

567
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:48,499
the is northern corn leaf blight say you

568
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,058
hire maybe four or five undergrads you

569
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:52,249
show them one leaf and you force them

570
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:55,849
out to go to the field and they have to

571
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:58,069
now do phenotyping for NCLB well you

572
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:59,569
just show them this one which has NCLB

573
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:02,990
but they see all these other examples

574
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:05,778
here Wow wouldn't it be so much easier

575
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,329
just to train a robot well at least

576
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:11,118
that's what I thought but obviously it's

577
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:15,349
important to invest in our youth of

578
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:18,589
tomorrow so so this idea is training

579
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:21,378
these convolutional neural networks so

580
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:24,859
this is what you refer to as in the old

581
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:28,788
days deep learning and now AI so the

582
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:31,668
idea is to combine this with drones to

583
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:35,839
detect these NLB lesions on made sleeves

584
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:38,210
in the field and to turn drones to just

585
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,720
you know for just being something fun

586
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,429
you see flying around or trying to tear

587
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,798
out of my kids hands when we're going to

588
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:48,169
target is that you're actually turning

589
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:52,158
them into a co-worker and a colleague

590
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:54,619
now so the the idea is you have your

591
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,669
drones flying over top of plots of maize

592
00:26:54,618 --> 00:27:02,240
and you have your RGB 3dr IRIScan in

593
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:03,740
here and then here is a disease lesion

594
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,249
but obviously you don't want to take as

595
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,509
I said early perhaps like eighty

596
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:13,009
thousand images and try to pick these

597
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:16,429
out by eye you wanted to train the CN NS

598
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:19,368
into detecting clb in maze the challenge

599
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,769
is we haven't evolved to the point where

600
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:23,418
the AIS can train themselves but I'm

601
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:25,609
sure that's coming in in the future

602
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:28,970
so here you can just kind of view it at

603
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:32,089
the CN n here is converting pixels into

604
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,999
words and the gossip thing doesn't need

605
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,499
to be linear so you can use curves and

606
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:40,009
shapes and everything like that

607
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:40,730
but this is where presence/absence in a

608
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,159
human being

609
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,409
terrain plant pathologists have to

610
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,769
classify this is the disease lesion or

611
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:51,409
it is a knot and I and I've been told by

612
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,450
the colleagues on his project after they

613
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,509
would do maybe several hundred bees per

614
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,569
day when David close their

615
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:59,069
eyes they would see disease lesions on

616
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:01,319
the back of their eyelids when they

617
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:03,509
would go to bed at night so I do feel

618
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,088
kind of horrible for it for that but

619
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,729
it's all in the name of science so here

620
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:10,348
we we have this was taking from if you

621
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,479
will a person as they walk through the

622
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:13,678
field with a handheld camera so you can

623
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:17,278
kind of view this from the point of view

624
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,959
of like a ground vehicle and we also

625
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,548
have all the ones from the drones that

626
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:23,629
we're training on right now and this

627
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:27,868
this case we trained on close to to 2000

628
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:31,259
photos that have been classified so here

629
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:34,288
we have our AI and these are all our

630
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,209
diseased lesions here and our AI this is

631
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:38,249
kind of viewed as a heat map and if it's

632
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:42,239
white that means it has a probability

633
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:46,618
you know of in a sense that is a disease

634
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:49,889
lesion if it's black there is none where

635
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:51,598
where it's black and so that's when it

636
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:52,858
when they are present and if they aren't

637
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,718
present then you should have an AI

638
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,818
trained very well so that you shouldn't

639
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:59,759
detect any lesions when there are none

640
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:03,209
present and in this case here we do not

641
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,399
find anything at all and after training

642
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,919
on these 2000s for this set that we have

643
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:10,258
we found maybe we're only wrong maybe 2

644
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,089
to 3 percent of the time so I think they

645
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,909
were doing pretty good perhaps when we

646
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:17,038
trained on 10,000 more we can maybe in

647
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:19,199
increase that even more so this is like

648
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,558
a very fun active area of research and

649
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:24,109
in my lab and on our bread project it's

650
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,088
kind of the same concept and now

651
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:30,058
changing to our handheld phones and this

652
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:34,499
is a colleague of mine where he in a

653
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:38,428
sense has developed AI to detect the

654
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:41,639
disease that's infecting like cassava

655
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:45,528
plant and in this case a a farmer or a

656
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:48,358
breeder can take a picture of a diseased

657
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:50,969
cassava plant and then the AI runs on

658
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:52,408
the phone or actually it can be sent to

659
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,808
to to to cloud where it's processed

660
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:57,559
there as well and then with a certain

661
00:29:54,808 --> 00:30:01,769
probability it'll tell you what cassava

662
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:03,868
disease it actually has and in in in the

663
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:05,839
future for our terror project that we

664
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:09,099
have we've kind of taken the pro

665
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,419
four are trying to develop low-cost

666
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:15,829
autonomous field robots that can go

667
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:23,600
through the fields and here and with our

668
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:26,449
colleagues at University of UIUC and the

669
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,789
idea here is so you can do canopy

670
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:32,210
reflectance canopy temperature and

671
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:35,569
canopy geometry and its onboard

672
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,299
processing as this can transect like the

673
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:41,839
plots in the field and it's recording

674
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:45,529
other climatic factors such as like soil

675
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:50,119
temperature air temperature as well so

676
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:53,180
our first leg version one is it'll cost

677
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,009
about 200k but we're very hopeful that

678
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,190
we can get the price down to like 20k

679
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:59,750
and then we can kind of think of a world

680
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,890
where we have these in everyone's hand

681
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:06,140
and then so we're testing this on

682
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:09,560
biomass sorghum and in my group we're

683
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,840
creating a hapmap for a few hundred

684
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:14,929
lines and an idea is where you can then

685
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:18,879
develop like a time series for like G by

686
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:22,970
E as all these variants in the hapmap

687
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,790
across the genome and see like genes

688
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,230
that are being turned on and off as I

689
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:29,539
was showing what I caught but really

690
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,640
beginning to factor in that Jeep ie come

691
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:35,180
component to try to figure out why it is

692
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,790
being turned on and off and what I think

693
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:41,840
about in the future where where I kind

694
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:45,139
of see my work proceeding is breeders

695
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,449
have a tremendous eye and I think at

696
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:51,850
some point we can clone it with with AI

697
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:54,049
and when you have these autonomous

698
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:55,669
breeding now I know I'm not going to

699
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:57,740
call them autonomous breeders they're

700
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,210
going to assist the breeders because of

701
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,190
course we don't want to replace the

702
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,980
breeders but what we want to do is

703
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,320
basically clone the breeders I and

704
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,049
perhaps maybe have maybe 10 to 20 of

705
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,329
these very low-cost robots

706
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:14,289
per breeder and perhaps there's maybe

707
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:18,049
some some simplistic traits and early

708
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,589
generation breeding such as height plant

709
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,658
pathology traits

710
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:23,519
that if you have maybe tens of thousands

711
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,950
of like head rows or something like that

712
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,658
that these robots could actually go

713
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,960
through and help pinpoint and then

714
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:33,090
tracked by GPS certain plants in the

715
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,220
field and then if the breeder isn't

716
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:37,558
happy with the plans that are chosen and

717
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,528
he or should she can just re retrain the

718
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,808
AI so I think we're kind of at a point

719
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:45,329
now when we need to be having that

720
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:49,079
conversation with all the computer

721
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:52,079
scientists all of the robotic engineers

722
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,278
on campus to really push our signs to a

723
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,398
place that we've haven't really

724
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,679
conceived quite yet because these things

725
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,689
are now becoming possible and I think

726
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,360
Cornell is at a place where we can drive

727
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,350
this to become a reality

728
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,719
and I'll let's thank all of my

729
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:08,158
colleagues and with that I will take

730
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
maybe one questions that I want to keep

731
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,659
you from your break and then we can

732
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,659
resume back at 11:00 all right thank you

733
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,038
[Applause]

734
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,038
yeah

735
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,880
when I think of my field in Aurora New

736
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,190
York I want to build a robot that can go

737
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,390
out and pick every stone out of my

738
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:56,740
people that's the first one I would do

739
00:33:51,390 --> 00:34:00,280
but I think the area in the Bairro

740
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,259
typing is like going to be I think the

741
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:07,859
future so if you can think of having

742
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:13,210
maybe low-cost ways since at the plots

743
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:16,659
like soil temperature how much soil

744
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,210
water moisture is in each plot and then

745
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:21,398
in a certain area you can record the

746
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,500
ambient air temperature and like other

747
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,569
factors over the whole growing season

748
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,719
then you can think about you know doing

749
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:31,269
factorial regression and trying to

750
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,898
figure out what is the contribution of

751
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:37,148
these changes in the e that's

752
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:39,460
contributing to my GMI G by E over the

753
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:40,779
whole growing season so I think there

754
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,030
there are some things that are coming

755
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,760
out now but they're not cheap enough to

756
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,550
you to the point where you're able just

757
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,610
to put one probe per like one plot so

758
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,889
perhaps you can try to like characterize

759
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:57,840
the actual variation in your field and

760
00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:00,940
then use like an approach to try to like

761
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,559
like close that gap if you will to kind

762
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,159
of fill in those void areas where you

763
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:09,190
have no probe so that's what I think we

764
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:14,980
really need to kind of go towards the G

765
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:18,360
by E question yeah all right thank you

766
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,360
everyone see you at 11:00

767
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:28,370
this has been a production of Cornell

768
