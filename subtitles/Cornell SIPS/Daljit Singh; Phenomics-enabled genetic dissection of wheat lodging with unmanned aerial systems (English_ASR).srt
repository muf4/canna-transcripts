1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,730
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,730
University

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:15,500
I think the previous speakers take nice

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:20,179
overview of how animal science and plant

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,820
science have you know work together and

6
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:25,879
some of the concepts from one one field

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,778
were used in another field so so this

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,608
this this cross-disciplinary learning

9
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:33,530
was was really important in driving the

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,920
plant breeding and as well as animal

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,890
breeding in the past I'll give you a

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,670
some personal example of how this

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,070
cross-disciplinary learning have helped

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,010
us answer some of the complex questions

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,609
in field phenotyping this is an example

16
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:55,899
from our lab so he started in 2014 with

17
00:00:52,609 --> 00:01:01,460
the UAV if you know typing a project I

18
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:03,229
joined Jesse program in genetics 14 and

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,629
right about that time we were starting

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:09,438
to explore UAV phenotyping and how we

21
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:12,530
can use this phenotyping in breeding so

22
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:16,489
we record involved in that project we

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,260
had engineering people people from

24
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:21,859
engineering department Kevin Wong he was

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,020
a postdoc in bio engineering a deal in

26
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:29,120
stock use of chemical engineer so he

27
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:33,189
started a UAV testing program so we

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,260
started a flying UAVs testing new new

29
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:38,090
platforms to see how with which which of

30
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,430
the platform fits well with the with our

31
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:46,879
goals we did a lot of testing and

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:51,770
crashing to but good thing is it was a

33
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,929
cheap UAV so we could afford so the arms

34
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:56,539
and legs were like very cheap so we

35
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:01,400
could replace them so a lot of learning

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,799
in 2014 and then 2015 we had people from

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,670
geography and by informatics joining in

38
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,219
and really helped us move ahead with the

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:14,378
with the with the learning some other

40
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:17,090
things for example we narrow down to

41
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:19,019
sensors what kind of senses we can use

42
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,759
and

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,670
so we picked one or two sensors that

44
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,919
were really working well with our with

45
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,929
our program and we made a lot of

46
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,929
progress in analyzing this data

47
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:39,209
2016 we had a a VA ssin engineer joining

48
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:41,919
our team and he was he really helped us

49
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:46,420
collect a lot of data in the field and

50
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:49,479
really ease my work because I was doing

51
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:52,378
a lot of flights and I the genetics was

52
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:56,500
which is my core field I totally was

53
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:59,639
behind so he really helped them so then

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,610
I started focusing on the genetics and

55
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:06,238
using some of these datasets generated

56
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,560
using these new to new platforms and

57
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,140
sensors so this is really to highlight

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,620
how cross-disciplinary teams can can

59
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:18,279
really bring in new learning in the and

60
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,739
how we can we can use this this T's

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,759
approaches to to answer some of the

62
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:29,890
complex questions so so ultimately like

63
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,769
this cross-disciplinary approach and all

64
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,619
these things so our main goal in in

65
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,650
Plant Sciences and Sciences is to

66
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,730
connect you know you know so but it's

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:48,069
it's a very crucial link if you want to

68
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:50,259
improve so but we also have to address

69
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:52,810
this shield phenotype important like at

70
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:54,129
the same time and high-throughput

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,799
phenotyping

72
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:01,359
can really help us to understand this

73
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,739
genotype phenotype link this STP can

74
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,919
allow us to rapidly and accurately

75
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,049
measure trades and in this specially in

76
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,969
the field which is really a bottleneck

77
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,299
so we can we can test a large number of

78
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:16,000
plots and field which can really help us

79
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,910
study these complex traits similar

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,430
traits which are really hard to measure

81
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,789
and I will give you an example today for

82
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,788
lodging

83
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,859
so a little bit of what we were doing it

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,870
we are doing in the in the in the lab

85
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,129
and some of the studies that came out

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,199
from our lab we had a few studies

87
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:41,430
showing how this new STP tools can be

88
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,770
used in large breeding nurseries really

89
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,500
one of the cool things cool thing about

90
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:49,079
UAV phenotyping is that we can you this

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,810
trade in a dynamic dynamic way because

92
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,149
we can we can measure this phenotyping

93
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,030
you can you can take these measurements

94
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,629
of measurements multiple times during

95
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:03,299
the season and that allows us to look at

96
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:05,490
the trait in a dynamic way we can you

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,829
can really see how things change over

98
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,139
time in season so rather than just

99
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:13,198
looking at a single point we can think

100
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:18,870
of it as a dynamic and imma trade and

101
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,788
this is an example so so UAS for

102
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,019
audience assessment in wheat this is

103
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:27,000
this is what I'll be talking about

104
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:28,529
mostly so lodging this is how it looks

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,598
from the sky

106
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:40,348
the drone I can see that just unaffected

107
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:42,689
by lodging so so we we so we thought

108
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:44,968
initially like when we saw this these

109
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:48,629
images I was collecting data regularly

110
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:51,810
for for hi-8 and NDB I other things then

111
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,569
I saw these images and then I Jesse and

112
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,860
I talked and we thought can we quantify

113
00:05:54,569 --> 00:06:03,090
this lodging using these this image

114
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,129
based approaches so just a little bit of

115
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,258
background lodging is a permanent

116
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:11,098
displacement of plant stem from its

117
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,009
upright position it can have a severe

118
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:17,519
impact on yield and yield and quality in

119
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:22,020
wheat but loading assessment and field

120
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,418
is very laborious and it's subjective in

121
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,120
nature

122
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:29,728
so this limits our population size for

123
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,060
genetic studies so this limits how how

124
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:34,769
many plots we can we can we can study in

125
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,899
the field so that was really the driving

126
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,219
force for us to use high-throughput

127
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:43,459
genotyping so that we

128
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,460
we can really address this this issue

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,560
so the the study objective was really to

130
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:57,200
to develop us-based lodging assessment

131
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,990
approach so ready to see how we can use

132
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,920
these image based approaches to quantify

133
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,189
a lodging at the field scale and then

134
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,180
also to to come up with the proof proof

135
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:13,420
of concept how we can use this this

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,470
these phenotypes they be image based

137
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,550
assessments to study the genetic

138
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:22,790
architecture of lodging so our field

139
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:27,160
setup was so these are heap trials

140
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:29,540
symmetry in trials in India we had this

141
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,150
experiment going on in the field I

142
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,670
basically I was already taking data as I

143
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:38,589
mentioned so I what I did was I

144
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:42,100
basically picked two dates free lodging

145
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:44,989
date and the post lodging day and

146
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:49,300
created generated a digital elevation

147
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:52,730
model from be straight these dates in

148
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,699
both here so we had a close to 600

149
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,610
entries in both years so and also at the

150
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:03,110
same time I collected ground truth data

151
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,550
just to compare how how how these image

152
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:09,020
based approaches that I'm going to test

153
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:14,480
on do compared to the two the visual

154
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:17,180
measurements so so the the approach that

155
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,930
I used was based on digital elevation

156
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,810
models I took a pre lodging digital

157
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,759
elevation model subtracted from post

158
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,280
lodging digital elevation model so

159
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,339
really to get a differential TEM which

160
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,600
is a change in elevation over time so

161
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:38,839
these two time points and then use this

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,210
differential diem in each plot to really

163
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,740
come up with two different indices one

164
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,860
is a very simple index which I call

165
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,740
differential lodging mean or DL mean or

166
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,950
digital logic mean so this is basically

167
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,940
just taking the average of all the

168
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,230
differential points with

169
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:04,250
applaud that that's first index second

170
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:08,300
index is a DL mixture I call this is a

171
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:14,330
based on a more informed a normal

172
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:16,429
mixture distribution based index so

173
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,250
little bit of how the DL mix is

174
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,659
calculated so basically we have

175
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,970
distinguish this an example from single

176
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:26,149
plot so we have a two normal

177
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,460
distributions one corresponds to the non

178
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,199
launched part and another one is a large

179
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,960
part of the part so we basically

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,160
estimated the parameters of each

181
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:40,670
distribution and came up with a came up

182
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:43,579
with a lodging index multiplying that

183
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:46,939
these two parameters from the large part

184
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:52,129
of the distribution so now I have two

185
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,290
digital lodging indices and three ground

186
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:58,850
truth measurements so I took lodging

187
00:09:54,289 --> 00:10:04,459
incidence which is a which is a severity

188
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:06,620
zero to understand lodging sorry this is

189
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,259
the incidence and severity is on a scale

190
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,460
of zero to ten how how much of the plot

191
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:16,639
is so the first one is how much of the

192
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:20,600
plot is the Lord area is loyd second one

193
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,360
is how severe is the lodging on the

194
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,120
scale of zero to ten so then I also

195
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,930
combined lodging index and and lodging

196
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:35,720
severity to see how this compares so we

197
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:40,338
explored phenotypic relationships on the

198
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,889
diagonal you can see the first three are

199
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,400
the visual traits visual assessments of

200
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:48,980
lodging this the last two are the DL

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,539
mean and DL mix and the in the

202
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,409
parentheses these are the broad sense

203
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:54,889
heritability

204
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:57,079
so this is 2016

205
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:00,740
we had comparable heritability z' broad

206
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:04,210
sensitivities and very high correlations

207
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,750
correlations among visual and the

208
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:09,389
digital assessments of lodging so so our

209
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,250
ma

210
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:14,039
space assessments were working at this

211
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,009
point I also looked into the genetic

212
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:21,049
correlations so genetic correlations

213
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:25,169
were also very high in both years above

214
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:28,139
0.9 so which was really good so so we

215
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:30,679
were so we were we had evidence that

216
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,139
what we are measuring is actually

217
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:39,569
lodging and they were measuring the same

218
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:42,000
variation so once we had this these

219
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,060
validation results we wanted to look at

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,009
into the genetic architecture and see

221
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:51,179
how we can use some of these approaches

222
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:54,960
and understanding the key genetic

223
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:58,039
architecture of lodging so in 2016 this

224
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,540
is a Manhattan plot from 2016 first year

225
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:05,730
there were no significant market rate

226
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:08,189
associations in 2017 however there was a

227
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,659
peak at from some to a this peak

228
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:15,240
correspondent to translocation segment

229
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,069
which is a translocation segment from a

230
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,409
jalops went to cosa which is a while

231
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,300
ancestral meet this 2ns segment is

232
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,490
involved in a lot of it has been

233
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,209
extensively used in in breeding programs

234
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,990
historically because it has a lot of

235
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,990
resistance genes

236
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:39,488
this peak was was really consistent

237
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:44,619
across all measures of lodging so that

238
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:46,839
was a good thing to see but an

239
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:48,759
interesting thing was that the restock

240
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,069
markers only explained up to two percent

241
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,859
of the variation so the variation was

242
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:56,248
was very low the variation explained by

243
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:59,699
these these markers was really low

244
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:02,470
suggesting that this could be a really

245
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:05,019
complex trade and trade with a diffuse

246
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,739
architecture with large number of small

247
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:13,048
effective low side so to explore that

248
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:16,168
hypothesis of diffuse architecture we

249
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:20,068
generated a k-fold genomic predictions

250
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:23,438
so we wanted to look how if we can

251
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:25,958
explain some of this unexplained

252
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:28,778
variation through genomic whole genome

253
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:32,518
prediction models so here is a

254
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:35,708
comparison in two years 2016 and 2017

255
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,959
there's a prediction accuracy and then

256
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:40,268
prediction accuracy scaled to the square

257
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:44,498
root of heritability to see how to show

258
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,720
how the the proportion of proportion of

259
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:49,409
heritability netic variation that is

260
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,600
explained by the prediction accuracies

261
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:56,259
so we were able to explain up to 53

262
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,899
percent of be the the digit heritable

263
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:04,959
genetic variation which was really nice

264
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:06,730
to see and we also tested it across

265
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,368
environments so crossing model

266
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,778
prediction accuracies were also high

267
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:13,839
here we are comparing the prediction

268
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:18,068
accuracy of phenotypic correlations and

269
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,209
genetic correlations so this so data

270
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:25,328
from luciana location where I collected

271
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:30,058
UAV drone data I used as a training set

272
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:33,729
to predict lodging at another location

273
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:37,259
in Pakistan so they had lodging in the

274
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,548
index values that they they they

275
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,688
collected in the field so I was able to

276
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:45,759
compare it across environments also and

277
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:47,529
the results were also encouraging across

278
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,120
environments so we were

279
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,039
so this was another validation of and

280
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,919
another proof of how how we can use some

281
00:14:54,039 --> 00:15:02,439
of these these UAV based credits to to

282
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:08,679
to look into the genetics of for complex

283
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:11,290
traits and then we were also wondering

284
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:16,269
if we can establish a relationship of

285
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:19,990
lodging with with the economic trade one

286
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:22,960
of the interesting things we saw was the

287
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,799
correlation of lodging with with grain

288
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:31,090
yield so in 2016 so this is a result

289
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:33,699
from 2016 was coalition was negative the

290
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:39,129
relationship is is opposite so you have

291
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:42,190
higher lodging lower yields 2017 however

292
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:45,610
was different the relationship quarter

293
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,710
worst so you have lines that are high

294
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,320
yielding they are more prone to logic

295
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,410
lodging so either of these cases can

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,100
happen in the field right so some years

297
00:15:53,409 --> 00:16:00,088
you can have lodging at that stage where

298
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,000
we're lodging happens earlier and then

299
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:07,570
it leads to two yield losses in other

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,250
cases you have lodging with lodging when

301
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:15,400
a crop is is already headed and it's you

302
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,549
know heavy and then the so it makes the

303
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:24,279
the high leaving plant more lodging

304
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:32,729
proven so that was interesting to see so

305
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:37,209
just quickly the take-home point time so

306
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,610
so hopefully I provided some evidence of

307
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:43,089
the scalable assessment of lodging on

308
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:47,110
thousands of field plots so we were able

309
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:49,300
to do that in the field this field based

310
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,629
high-throughput phenotyping can be used

311
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:55,750
to study complex traits and plants we

312
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:57,939
have that so not only just study we have

313
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,708
other examples from other studies we

314
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,390
have we can use some of these new tools

315
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:05,480
to

316
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:08,959
tools to study the complex traits and

317
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,650
feed genomic predictions can adequately

318
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,170
explain the heritable genetic variation

319
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:20,269
the complex traits traits with complex

320
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,519
genetic architecture digital lodging can

321
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:25,549
be integrated with current reading and

322
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,828
prediction pipelines a lot of reading

323
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,649
programs have started using this UAV

324
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:35,659
based approaches so so these approaches

325
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:39,310
so so having a new new trait you know

326
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,259
from this study they can easily use this

327
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:46,519
easily incorporate this these new tools

328
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:50,990
into their breeding programs UAV

329
00:17:46,519 --> 00:18:00,519
programs can really benefit from from

330
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:05,000
the predictions and so finally thanks to

331
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:07,119
my advisor Jesse Poland at Kansas State

332
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,690
University we have a great team at

333
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:14,569
Poland lab then we have collaborate

334
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,740
great collaborators Borlaug Institute

335
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:22,039
for South Asia in India CIMMYT Mexico

336
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,400
has been a good big support

337
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,440
Robby Singh's program on read we have

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,920
cement Pakistan our collaborator

339
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:38,930
Mohammed in India's so they were great

340
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:44,220
asset and our funding agencies thank you

341
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:47,740
[Applause]

342
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:52,990
thank you I was terrific um we open it

343
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,940
up to questions now how far off of the

344
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,120
centerline of those plots did you have

345
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,730
to fly in order to get that height that

346
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,229
height measurement when you're flying

347
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,130
directly over you can't see the height

348
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:10,990
right no yeah so when we are so when we

349
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:14,440
plan our flight we have a 7080 percent

350
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,569
overlap between the images so we make

351
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,538
sure that we have this 7080 percent side

352
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:21,609
and forward overlap so basically using

353
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:24,669
this this overlap we can create a 3d

354
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:26,949
model so we have 3d points so that's how

355
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:31,390
we could leap it better so this this

356
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,640
height was was extracted using the Z

357
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,950
value so you have X Y and then with the

358
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,049
3d model you can have a Z value the Z

359
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,480
value is your height so basically it's a

360
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:46,900
you can do height and enlarges lodging

361
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:49,750
is an extension of height so in terms of

362
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,480
the you know did it large because it was

363
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,609
super weak and that'll be loading or

364
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,759
because it was too powerful for its own

365
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:59,139
good and I mean so how many time points

366
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,759
do you have the did you do the fire

367
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,669
doesn't have a digital elevation models

368
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,679
for like how many times a year did you

369
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,509
do the flyover that was that you could

370
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,610
get the digital elevation models just

371
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,859
once okay so if you did it at like three

372
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,908
time points you would yeah actually I

373
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:17,288
have more time points so you mean like

374
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,730
different days yeah if you did it once

375
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,769
early in the season and late in the

376
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,288
season itself which one right so the

377
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:28,089
thing is like sometimes your plots they

378
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:30,940
get up and then so so the these points

379
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:35,529
were chosen based on when I took the

380
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:38,409
visual observations so the visual field

381
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:41,879
observations so I just picked those two

382
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:44,950
dates but if you look at the temporal

383
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,919
like different days you can see

384
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,960
sometimes the plots can get up right it

385
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,150
just really may be like if this is

386
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,900
something that that can be notches

387
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,910
yeah yeah so so it can't be like it's

388
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,980
not always like hundred percent but you

389
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,170
know if it's on the scale of one to ten

390
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,880
ten being like fully lost you can come

391
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,910
back to like seven or six or something

392
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,820
so the change is like with with time so

393
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:13,930
maybe yeah we can we can map that

394
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:18,309
trade-off see ya do we have any

395
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:25,600
questions on the zoom we can see thank

396
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:29,319
you this has been a production of
