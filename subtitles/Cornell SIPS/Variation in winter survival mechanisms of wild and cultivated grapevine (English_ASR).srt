1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,119
University the title of my talk today is

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,558
variation in Winter survival mechanisms

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,278
of wild and cultivated grape vine and I

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,000
just wanted to point out that I don't

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,600
like to work with grape Vines when

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,160
they're ugly green and filled with fruit

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,920
but I prefer to be out in the field in

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,839
the middle of the winter when it's

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,800
really comfortable and the vines look

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,278
like they're

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,920
dead but before we get into

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,759
into the actual research I wanted to

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,039
give a little bit more of an enhanced uh

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,000
introduction to myself uh as was brought

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,839
up my background is in molecular biology

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,679
and plant biology in particular but my

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,719
graduate and post-doctoral work was

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,399
mostly in population genetics and

20
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,960
population ecology and I worked with

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,759
cultivated and wild rice and then as I

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,558
moved on in my post stock I worked with

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,079
Bentgrass and canola and so I've had a

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,839
lot of experience jumping around in

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
different plant systems and always from

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,719
a population biology standpoint so I

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,719
like to understand crops and their wild

28
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,478
ancestors and the traits that we've

29
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,719
manage to select from the wild and then

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,640
use uh for crop

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,519
Improvement throughout my studies I've

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,320
always been very interested in

33
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,280
adaptation and the evolution of stress

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,599
responses in Plants I just think it's

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,920
particularly interesting that plants

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,599
can't remove themselves from a stressful

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
situation they have to adapt or they die

38
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,078
and so in the past I've worked on a

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,478
number of different uh stressful

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,279
conditions from the plant's point of

41
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,200
view including aluminum tolerance in

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,118
rice and herbicide resistance and

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,759
drought resistance in canola and B

44
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,280
grass the other thing I wanted to uh

45
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,680
make a point of is that in jumping

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,118
around in these different systems and

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,079
looking at population genetics and

48
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,478
population

49
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,279
ecology I tend to also move between the

50
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,959
lab and the field frequently and so i'

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,159
I've got a good set of molecular hands

52
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,199
but I also tend to do a lot of

53
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,000
experimental work out in the field and

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,439
in uh green houses like our pictur down

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,200
here on the bottom right um to set up

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,679
stressful conditions and try to model uh

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,598
how the climate might be changing and

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
affecting plant

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,280
growth so then I just wanted to also

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,080
introduce um the USDA ARS ggu or the

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,199
grape genetics Research Unit uh we're

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
based up on the Cornell extension campus

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,000
uh in

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,280
Geneva inside ggu we have two major

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,959
research programs uh which are titled up

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
here we have a a research program

67
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,959
looking at improving grape root stock

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,759
and Scion Pest and disease resistance

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,439
and a second program called the genetics

70
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,079
and genomics of grape growth development

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,199
and quality this is the program that I

72
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,599
work

73
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,560
in inclusive of these two programs there

74
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,479
are five research scientists with

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Associated support staff uh gang Jong is

76
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,518
our research leader and he focuses on

77
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,680
functional genomics Lance kale Davidson

78
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,439
uh focuses on biotic stress genetics

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,400
particularly powdery mildew and Downey

80
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,079
mildew of graap Vine Chris Owens focuses

81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,239
on fruit quality genetics Angela Baldo

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,840
is our computational biologist and as um

83
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,480
was pointed out I joined the group a

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,000
year ago and my focus is abiotic stress

85
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,759
genetics with focus on cold tolerance

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,120
but also dabbling in uh drought

87
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,120
resistance and solinity

88
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,639
resistance so just as a perimeter in

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,040
case anybody isn't familiar with grap

90
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,598
Vines um vidis venro cultivated

91
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,878
Grapevine is one of the most important

92
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,039
Horticultural fruit crops that we grow

93
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,878
is consumed as fresh fruit dried for

94
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,519
raisins or press for press for juice or

95
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:42,280
fermented in wine and actually about 71%

96
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,039
of the grapes that are grown are grown

97
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,318
for wine

98
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:49,000
production um gra Vine is really

99
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,798
interesting from a population genetics

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,438
and population ecology point of view

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,840
there are thousands of cultivars grown

102
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,719
across the world but many of them are

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,280
ancient they there was something perfect

104
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,239
about growing conditions thousands of

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,280
years ago

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
that farmers vegetatively propagated a

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,959
certain set of cultivars time and time

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,318
again and now those cultivars are grown

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,400
across the planet in a number of

110
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,518
different environments this is really

111
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,438
interesting from the point of view of

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,600
abiotic stress

113
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,918
adaptation we also have um a sequence

114
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,840
genome that allows us to start applying

115
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,560
molecular and genetic tools towards

116
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,519
understanding how traits are inherited

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
traits are

118
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,359
expressed from the population biology

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
point of view there are three different

120
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,639
Gene pools in the genus

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,160
vidus in Asia there's approximately 40

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,240
species there's about two European

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,880
species vidus Fifer is the cultivated

124
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,360
grape and its wild ancestors also

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,079
considered European and in North America

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
we have roughly 20 species and these

127
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,599
numbers change a little bit depending on

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
who you talk to but this is the general

129
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,680
layout of wild

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,639
vidus at the USDA in Geneva we maintain

131
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,800
the cold hearty grape germ plasm for the

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,560
United States I think we have roughly

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,240
1600 different genotypes uh of which we

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,720
have all the cold hearty uh varieties

135
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,759
I've listed some of the species here in

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
the bottom right and these are species

137
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,280
names that I'll be using throughout the

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,000
rest of my talk vus estal scaria

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,079
labrusca riparia rupestris and vulpina

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,918
and to give you an idea of the

141
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,639
distribution of these species I've

142
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,000
placed three of them on on the board

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,519
here um vus RAR is in the top left

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,560
corner and if you can see the the lime

145
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,399
green is a county level distribution of

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,360
where you can find rip records of

147
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,000
riparia so you can see it's really

148
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,038
diverse in the type of uh climates that

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,038
it could be inhabiting in the US all the

150
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,159
way from Southern Louisiana to Manitoba

151
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,079
and Quebec and west to east from

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,680
Colorado and Montana to the Northeast so

153
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,879
you can imagine a lot of different

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,280
climate gradients exist in that swath of

155
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,918
geography so there's a lot of potential

156
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,879
for wild um grap possessions to carry

157
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,719
unique adaptations to some of these

158
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,478
abiotic stresses that I'm tasked with

159
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,479
working on

160
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,839
I also put up uh Vitus labrasa and V

161
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,239
estal just as another comparison and

162
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,519
that almost all of these wild species

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,680
have a very wide Geographic range so all

164
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,758
of the different species have the

165
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,759
potential to be mind for important

166
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,399
traits I wanted to mention that cold

167
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,239
stress response and hardiness is a

168
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,519
really complex topic there's lots of

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,000
different traits that could be playing a

170
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,758
role and lots of different time points

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,279
throughout the the growing season that

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,720
cold stress could be

173
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,719
important it's important to note that

174
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,639
cold stress is tissue dependent if you

175
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,840
look at green tissues versus dormit

176
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,319
tissues what the plant perceives as a

177
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,839
cold stress could be very different um

178
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,520
Roots versus uh chots perceive uh

179
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,799
temperature cin drought all very

180
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,000
different so you have to kind of dial

181
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,120
down and figure out which traits are

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
going to be

183
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,800
workable there's also a vast array of

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,879
mechanical and molecular mechanisms that

185
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,759
contribute to cold hardiness if you can

186
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:08,680
uh remove a damaged um plant organ and

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,560
avoid uh cold shock it's one potential

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,319
way to get around uh Dam or sustained

189
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,478
damage or you could have an army of

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,960
molecular Sheron that help stabilize

191
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,120
membranes and proteins when the plant is

192
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,478
undergoing a cold

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,598
shock uh down on the bottom of the

194
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:29,038
screen

195
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:30,598
is my uh attempt to draw a growth cycle

196
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,079
which what I'm trying to illustrate here

197
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,719
is that as the plants go from Winter to

198
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,719
Spring through summer to fall and back

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,759
into winter there are different points

200
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,400
in the growing season that cold can

201
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,479
affect uh the plant survival in Winter

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,079
uh we could have very sharp drops in

203
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,038
temperature that kill dormant tissues

204
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,318
and in the spring after Bud burst Frost

205
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,399
unseasonable or unseasonable throst can

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,639
damage green tissues the same thing can

207
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,318
occur in a fall prior to plants having

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,560
enough time to acclimate and go to sleep

209
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,080
before the um uh the coming

210
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,240
winter these sort of stresses the tissue

211
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:11,399
dependence and the difference in defense

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,199
mechanisms are shared across perennial

213
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,239
species and there's lots of variation in

214
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,280
what tactics work for different model

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,000
systems but in one General theme are

216
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,638
these cold binding Factor genes which

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,639
are transcription factors that seem to

218
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,840
be activated by cold and drought um

219
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,759
stress and

220
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:37,519
create a molecular Cascade of Defense

221
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,639
responses the whole point of cold

222
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,399
tolerance in growing tissues is to

223
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,799
prevent ice formation from forming

224
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,639
inside of living

225
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:51,719
cells and so this is also my personal um

226
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:55,639
attempt to draw what cold damage looks

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,399
like I don't have an art degree um this

228
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:02,399
is a plant cell on the left with a um an

229
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,039
attempt at thids mitochondria nucleus

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,759
just imagine there's lots of different

231
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,559
uh plant organs or cell organs inside as

232
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,480
the plant perceives freezing stress it

233
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:16,039
tries to export water to prevent uh the

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,200
chance of ice forming inside the living

235
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:22,480
cell water can freeze outside of cells

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,800
and not damage the living tissue and

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,240
so um this is called the high

238
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,439
temperature exotherm where ice freezes

239
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,360
and doesn't cause lethal damage

240
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,440
but as temperature continues to

241
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,079
decrease the ice creates a uh water

242
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,760
gradient that causes water to

243
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,879
continuously be pulled from the cell and

244
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:46,360
so the cell starts to uh be stressed by

245
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,439
dehydration and if dehydration becomes

246
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,480
uh extreme you can start having

247
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,480
membranes fusing

248
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,159
together at some point the molecular and

249
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,879
mechanical mechanisms um that or

250
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,360
defenses that are mounted to prevent ice

251
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,278
formation within the cell fail at and

252
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,759
you have ice crystals form within the

253
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,039
living cell causing lethal damage and

254
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,838
this is called the low temperature

255
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:13,599
exm if you happen to avoid this say it

256
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,560
gets warmer water can re-enter the cell

257
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,159
as the gradient is Switched and if your

258
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,199
membranes have fused together you can

259
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,039
have lethal damage even though the the

260
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,480
plant tissue didn't freeze solid because

261
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,919
as the membranes re-expand they rip

262
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,200
apart and so you lose cellular

263
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,519
function so there's a whole list of

264
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,120
potential mechanisms to

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,679
prevent this Cascade from happening

266
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,560
there's avoidance mechanisms like um

267
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,638
super cooling transporting the water out

268
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,119
of the cell uh formation of sugar

269
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,519
glasses to keep membranes apart uh

270
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,519
tissue barriers as I mentioned before

271
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,519
there's also uh mechanisms that are

272
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,200
typically called tolerance mechanisms

273
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,278
where membranes may change their

274
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,879
polarity there may be chaperon imp

275
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,039
placed inside membranes to prevent them

276
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,559
from fusing with one another cryo

277
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,240
protective proteins could be produced to

278
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,159
help stabilize protein function and

279
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,039
compatible solutes could be produced to

280
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,838
uh increase the cell's AB or the plant

281
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,039
cell's ability to hold on to water even

282
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
when there is a water

283
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,040
gradient this is what it looks like if

284
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,399
you try to put it into molecular terms

285
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,799
the whole process of coal and

286
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,679
dehydration stress as you can see it's a

287
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:31,278
big mess green arrows uh are promoter

288
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,039
arrows those red repressor signs are

289
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,200
genes that function as repressors what I

290
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,799
wanted to just bring up was that you

291
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,639
have cold or changes in light or

292
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,958
dehydration some sort of external

293
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,440
stimuli it leads to a transcription

294
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,518
Factor Cascade that culminates here in

295
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
the CBF regulon remember I I mentioned

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,200
the cold binding Factor

297
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,679
genes these genes activate a whole

298
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,639
series of Downstream genes uh called

299
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,879
core genes and kin genes many of which

300
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,639
we don't know what they do other than

301
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,439
they lead to the production of

302
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,278
cryoprotectants and um compatible

303
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,880
solutes sometimes soluble sugars all

304
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,759
which are thought to help with that U

305
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:15,559
prevention of lethal dehydration and Ice

306
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,559
formation within the

307
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,838
cell so there's many different aspects

308
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,239
of cold stress and

309
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,320
hardiness there's dormy and reduced

310
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,639
deacclimation so how the plant perceives

311
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,639
winter is coming how it goes to sleep

312
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,799
and then reactivates in the summer or

313
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,198
the spring midwinter Bud survival is

314
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,879
understanding how buds can survive lower

315
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:40,000
and lower temperatures without having

316
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,799
that internal Ice uh occurrence and then

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,278
survival against spring and spring and

318
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,000
fall

319
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,439
Frost but one thing that pops in my mind

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
is maybe we don't need to worry about uh

321
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,199
coold tolerance if climate change is

322
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
occurring and global temperatures are

323
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,198
rising we just need to wait a couple

324
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,838
more years and then Winters will be 70

325
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,479
and there's no reason for me to have a

326
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,440
job

327
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,278
but if you think about the way that

328
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,360
climate uh change is predicted to occur

329
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,519
there are supposed to be more and more

330
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,320
erratic weather patterns and so there's

331
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,240
the potential for rapid changes in

332
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,760
temperature exposing green tissues to

333
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,680
freezing

334
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,679
conditions and this is an example of

335
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:23,519
what hap when that happens uh this is

336
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:25,958
pictures from space in uh 2006 if we

337
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,879
look at early April what the phenology

338
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,838
of the United States looks like versus

339
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,278
20 days roughly 20 days later you can

340
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,519
see that there's a lot more leaves a lot

341
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,240
more Bud burst in those 20 days my J

342
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,198
this is from space

343
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,680
but this is what it looks like in April

344
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,278
of the following

345
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,319
year after they've had a very very warm

346
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,399
month of March so phenology is Advanced

347
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,079
by several weeks and this must sound

348
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,879
very similar to what we had this past

349
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:56,879
year so phology gets Advanced a month

350
00:13:52,879 --> 00:14:00,278
early then we have a return to normal

351
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,838
Cold Spring temperatures that wipes out

352
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,720
uh early green tissues and so you can

353
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,880
see that the the dark green has been

354
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
completely reset uh to the lighter green

355
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,879
showing you that there's been a lot of

356
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,399
damage and it's estimated that this

357
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,399
particular Easter freeze caused

358
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,559
somewhere around two billion worth of

359
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,799
Agriculture and Horticultural damage

360
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,879
impacting lots of our our standard crops

361
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,799
wheat Rye barley and corn and then all

362
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,799
of our fruit crops which they're listed

363
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:29,599
down here at the

364
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,559
bottom so this is the sort of climate uh

365
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,920
Swift changes in climate that we're

366
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,919
worried about as far as cold tolerance

367
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:41,000
goes this is why I should keep my

368
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,078
job so green tissues are very cold

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,799
tender and they can't survive long bouts

370
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:46,519
of

371
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,078
freezing and on grapes this is uh

372
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,759
important to note because grapes are

373
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,399
primarily fruitful in the primary Bud

374
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,959
the infloresence Marist stems are laid

375
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,440
down the year before and so whatever

376
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,638
bursts out of that primary bud is where

377
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,160
you're going to get your fruit and your

378
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,320
Harvest from so if you get a killing

379
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,679
Frost in the early spring that kills off

380
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,399
the first Bud the plants will usually

381
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,359
survive because they'll push buds from

382
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,159
secondary and tertiary buds but they'll

383
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,000
be far less fruitful if they produce

384
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,159
fruit at all so this is really bad from

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,799
the farmers's point of view and this

386
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,399
just illustrates what that sort of frost

387
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,399
kill looks

388
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,879
like so that's the end of the background

389
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,799
I was just going to now tell you about

390
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,078
three sort of preliminary studies that

391
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,198
we're conducting to try to get at

392
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:33,278
looking at Cold uh grap fine cold

393
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,799
tolerance so the first one's going to be

394
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,600
looking at dormy chilling and de

395
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,240
acclamation and wild grap Vine then

396
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,199
we're going to look a little bit at midw

397
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,079
midwinter Bud hardiness and finish up

398
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,679
with a little discussion on osmotic

399
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,198
mechanisms that could be contributing to

400
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,198
midwinter

401
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,318
hardiness so to start acclamation and

402
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,879
dorcy and I apologize if this is a

403
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,679
little too redundant I'm not sure where

404
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:05,318
everybody is on cold tolerant so

405
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,838
um as far as uh dormy goes from the

406
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,120
prospect or from the point of view from

407
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,360
the plant there's several different

408
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,679
stages during the growing season basil

409
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,480
buds are thought of as being parad

410
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,198
dormant which is right here where apical

411
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,879
buds are suppressing the growth of those

412
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:25,919
buds through hormone

413
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,958
control as the uh plants enter fall and

414
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,439
they start receiving lower temperature

415
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,159
cues and light temperature cues you have

416
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,880
a change in molecular and metabolic

417
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,958
status that tells the plant to start

418
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,759
going to sleep so this is called

419
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,159
endodormancy once the plant's gone fully

420
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,480
to sleep but we really haven't gotten to

421
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,278
the middle of winter here the final

422
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,079
stage of dorcy is Eco Eco dorcy this

423
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,838
occurs after endodormancy has been

424
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,359
fulfilled by currently some unknown

425
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,839
factor and the plant is ready to grow

426
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,399
the only thing keeping it from growing

427
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
is the fact that it's still winter so

428
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,559
the environmental parameters of growth

429
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,120
are not favorable

430
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,799
when those are lifted growth resumes in

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,240
the spring and so this is sort of what

432
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,078
the curve in dormy looks like uh

433
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,720
pictured here on the bottom

434
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,918
left uh acclamation takes place over

435
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,959
several months the deepest hardiness and

436
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,600
dorcy occurs in the middle of the winter

437
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,439
and then as you enter spring

438
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,798
deacclimation and resumption of growth

439
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,120
occurs at a much faster rate than the

440
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,759
plant took to become apped in the

441
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,759
beginning in the beginning of the

442
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,360
year

443
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,918
the amount of cold that the plant needs

444
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,319
to experience to fulfill endodormancy is

445
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,759
important because if the plant doesn't

446
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,359
achieve that magical number when you

447
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,000
return to growing conditions in the

448
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,479
spring buds will not burst synchronously

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,960
so you'll have growth occur on Grape

450
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,679
Vines but they'll it'll be a spotty one

451
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,798
bud here one bud there desynchronized

452
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,200
bud burst leads to very desynchronized

453
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,000
flowering and desynchronized fruiting

454
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,640
desynchronized ripening and so farmers

455
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,079
don't want to be harvesting grapes at

456
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,240
multiple time points in the fall they

457
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,879
want to go through and get it all at

458
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,240
once so it's very important to have

459
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,400
grape vines that are able to satisfy the

460
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,120
endodormancy the chilling

461
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
requirement prior to the growing season

462
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,399
depending on where they are so this this

463
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,319
leads us to this idea of a a dream grape

464
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,960
vine so if you're growing grapes in a

465
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,839
warm climate you want a grap Vine that

466
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,919
goes to sleep in the winter but only

467
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,959
needs a small winter because you only

468
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,240
have a small winter

469
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
and that will leading to gra vines that

470
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,079
will them burst synchronously in the

471
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,120
spring in cold climates we don't mind so

472
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,199
much how long the chilling hours are

473
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,798
because our Winters are plenty

474
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,200
long what we want is a grap Vine that

475
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,519
comes out of dormy and kind of takes its

476
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
time slows itself down because otherwise

477
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,158
you end up with what we ended up last

478
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,400
year you have grap Vines pushing in the

479
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,919
early spring followed by a sudden Frost

480
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,640
and we lose part of our crop so it

481
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,200
depends on where you're going grap vines

482
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,480
on what sort of of traits you're looking

483
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,798
for so what we do to assess chilling

484
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,679
requirement uh in Wild grap Vines is we

485
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:11,639
go out to the germ plasm uh in November

486
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,360
early November and take cuting right

487
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,720
after the first killing Frost the one

488
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,079
that the frost that knocks down the

489
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,400
leaves we collect a whole bunch of canes

490
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:23,279
and put them in a cold room at 5° C 5° C

491
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,640
is sort of The Sweet Spot for the cold

492
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,119
clock in grae as long as they're held at

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,799
5° or lower they start counting towards

494
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,399
the end of that endodormancy we then

495
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,960
take the cuttings out of the cauld at

496
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
several time points during the winter

497
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,480
and put them in forcing conditions and

498
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,559
see if they're ready if they've

499
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,120
fulfilled that endodormancy time limit

500
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,200
this is just on the picture on the left

501
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,759
here is what the experiment looks like

502
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,679
it's just a bunch of cuting in a growth

503
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,839
chamber and we go down and assess

504
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,360
whether or not they're

505
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,839
growing this is what the data looks like

506
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,879
from one of these experiments pictured

507
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:02,918
here is results from the cultivated grap

508
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Vine Cabernet svon and we have sort of a

509
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,679
um randomly chosen time point to assess

510
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:12,599
when endodormancy has ended and that's

511
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:15,720
at at four weeks if 50% of the buds have

512
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,199
burst after four weeks in uh forcing

513
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,440
conditions we consider endodormancy to

514
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,880
be fulfilled and so you can see here

515
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,159
that for Cabernet svon we don't really

516
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,240
call um the 50% Bud burst

517
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,799
until uh I oh yeah Geneva can't see my

518
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,640
pointer I keep forgetting that uh I

519
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:37,240
would say around a thousand hours of

520
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,520
cold so if you look at this graph the

521
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,319
far right line is the darkest red line

522
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,759
that's zero hours in the cold we cut it

523
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:45,079
from the field put it in a growth

524
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:49,720
chamber and then as you step back in

525
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:51,639
lines and in uh more and more pink color

526
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,679
these are time points where the the

527
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,840
cuting have been in the cold room for a

528
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,280
longer and longer period of time so you

529
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:02,079
can see that it takes about a, hours for

530
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,519
Cabernet soone to be ready to burst and

531
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,519
the other thing I want you to note is

532
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,158
the longer that you keep them in the

533
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,759
cold the faster they burst and the more

534
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,640
synchronous they burst so there's a

535
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,640
couple different clocks going on here an

536
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,320
ultimate clock and then one that you can

537
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,080
speed up over time so Jason what was the

538
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:23,399
preferred the preferred was to have

539
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,319
50% say that again that's kind of the

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,120
that's kind of the journal level cuto

541
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,278
off for endodormancy is 50% Bud burst at

542
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,839
four weeks in forcing

543
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,440
conditions that it could be a little

544
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,439
subjective

545
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,440
though so I'm not going to show you tons

546
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,480
and tons of graphs but I wanted to show

547
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,278
how we have variation within the germ

548
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,278
plasm samples that I'm evaluating from

549
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,919
the field we have genotypes that require

550
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,400
very low amounts of chilling so on the

551
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,559
top of the the slide here we have reing

552
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,840
and then uh wild species vidus raria

553
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:59,038
from Manitoba and you can see for both

554
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,918
of these cultivars that they satisfy

555
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,599
their Endo dorcy with very little

556
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:07,278
chilling and they um with increased

557
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,000
chilling you actually have with the uh

558
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:12,640
riparia from Manitoba they don't require

559
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,679
any start at seven days they've burst to

560
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
completion so they're very fast out of

561
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,120
the gates after a certain amount of

562
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
cold we also have genotypes that require

563
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,359
high amounts of chilling and here's two

564
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,519
wild species vids full pin on the left

565
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:25,879
and vidus repus on the right and you can

566
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,158
just see by looking at the distribution

567
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,840
of the lines that they require a lot

568
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,360
more chilling in order to satisfy that

569
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,359
bud burst

570
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,240
requirement this is another way of

571
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,399
looking at the data um if you look at if

572
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,120
you take all the cuting that were placed

573
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,880
into the growth chamber after 500 hours

574
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:50,558
of chilling this is how how many days

575
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,400
they require before they burst so it

576
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,879
gives you an idea that there are there

577
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,159
are some varieties that will not burst

578
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,640
at all 60 hours actually means never

579
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,960
burst and in this experiment so these

580
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,640
buds though they're totally viable don't

581
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,319
burst after 8 weeks without chilling so

582
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,278
they need this chilling in order to get

583
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,678
that counter going over time you can see

584
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:17,119
that they get better and better in

585
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,759
bursting with um increased chilling the

586
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,558
other thing I want you to note is that

587
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,720
there's a big difference between in this

588
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,038
example amurensis on the bottom which

589
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,600
requires very little chilling and bursts

590
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,480
faster and faster and faster and volpino

591
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,439
which requires a lot of chilling and

592
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,960
even after 2,000 hours it's increased

593
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,320
its chilling time but it can never

594
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,120
really match the speed of amurensis and

595
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,439
so there's got to be some genetic

596
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,278
control over the clock and the speed of

597
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,240
that

598
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:47,640
clock picture on the bottom is uh three

599
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,839
sessions of vidis vulpina and three

600
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,159
ession of vid scaria just demonstrating

601
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,439
to you that we have variation within a

602
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,200
species for the response as well and in

603
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,558
vulpen you can see that all three

604
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,840
varieties start out together the same

605
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,359
and then as they accumulate chilling

606
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,839
hours they start to diverge in their

607
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,759
ability to hit any particular U Bud

608
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,158
burst

609
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,558
speed scenario is kind of the opposite

610
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,278
in that with very little chilling the

611
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:15,278
three varieties are very diverse in

612
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,278
their response but then as they

613
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,720
accumulate chilling hours they Converge

614
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:23,519
on a set uh in this case it's three

615
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,798
weeks to Bud burst after 2,000

616
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,319
hours so this is um just to illustrate

617
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,359
some of the Phenix type that we're

618
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:34,639
trying to understand um with dorcy and

619
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,158
Bud burst rates in Wild

620
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,320
germplasm we want to also understand how

621
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,278
this might relate to midwinter Bud

622
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,759
hardiness this is the trait that's been

623
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,278
the focus of the majority of um

624
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,759
Grapevine breeding for cold hardiness

625
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,440
and grape vine breeders have typically

626
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,759
used vidus riparia from northern

627
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,679
locations in breeding programs and it's

628
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,158
been very successful in uh conveying

629
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,559
midwinter Bud hardiness and I've placed

630
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,399
up here two examples Mar p and front

631
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,798
both of which are able to survive to

632
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:06,398
temperatures of 36°

633
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,839
f um the problem with this may be that b

634
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:10,959
riparia sessions can be very prone to

635
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,678
early Bud break and I put down here

636
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,159
again the Manitoba sample that I showed

637
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,679
you before that after a long winter

638
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,720
they're able to break bud after one week

639
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,278
so in a situation where we have a really

640
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,839
warm March and then a very cold April

641
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,480
something that carries a lot of riparia

642
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,918
background might be more susceptible to

643
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
frost uh damage

644
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,120
so we want to understand how genotypes

645
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,440
differ in midwinter heiness in order to

646
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,199
um make good breeding

647
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,960
decisions so we assess uh midwinter

648
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,159
heiness using uh digital thermal

649
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,038
analysis which is looking at that low

650
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,600
temperature exotherm that I pointed out

651
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,759
in my cartoon the temperature at which

652
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,798
the water freezes inside cells signaling

653
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,319
lethality we do this by uh excising buds

654
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:58,359
from the field putting them in this

655
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,960
Nifty programmable freezer uh lowering

656
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,240
the temperature over time and as the

657
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,679
water inside the bud goes from liquid to

658
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,798
Crystal and it freezes there's a small

659
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,960
release of heat which is registered as a

660
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,278
change in voltage and we're able to

661
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,079
observe at what temperature buds die and

662
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,038
so here pictured um in the graph you can

663
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,439
see two strong Peaks here these are two

664
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,720
primary buds from two Bud cuttings as

665
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,480
the temperature U caused lethal damage

666
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,880
and then a very small Peak afterwards

667
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,960
which is probably a secondary Bud that

668
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,440
was still attached to the cutting

669
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
secondary and tertiary buds tend to be a

670
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,519
little bit

671
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,399
heartier so we can track these hardiness

672
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,558
values throughout the

673
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,479
season this is what last winter looked

674
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,720
like these are daily Min and Max

675
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,640
temperatures uh with the freezing point

676
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,120
Illustrated here in the horizontal black

677
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,240
line um I do apologize I flip between

678
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,719
Fahrenheit and Celsius frequently

679
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,558
um sorry about that I didn't realize

680
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,600
until he uh practicing this just go with

681
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,000
relatives we're always below the

682
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,000
freezing point in these graphs so what

683
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,798
you can see with our winter is it was uh

684
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,558
pretty warm in November and December got

685
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,639
a little bit chilly then around New

686
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,558
Year's we got a pulse of very cold

687
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,840
weather then another few days of very

688
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,558
very cold weather warmed back up and we

689
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,319
had a super warm March and if you were

690
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,960
to see this go you'd see our April come

691
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:26,480
crashing back down the other

692
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:30,558
side if we look at uh the DTA results

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,679
for Vi ifra cab Fran and reing um these

694
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,240
are the values from this past winter

695
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,919
this is the lt50 so if the temperature

696
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,759
had dipped down and intersected with one

697
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,679
of these lines we would expect about 50%

698
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,398
of the buds on that plant to have been

699
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,640
killed you can see good news nobody had

700
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,798
that problem this

701
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,799
winter I I should also mention that this

702
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,240
is all data that's been collected in

703
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,558
collaboration with Tim Martinson who

704
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,880
runs the extension on the Geneva campus

705
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,678
his group does all the colle ction of

706
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,679
the buds uh and the DTA runs and then I

707
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,798
do some Downstream

708
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,840
processing this is what it looks like if

709
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:12,639
you look at uh hybrid varieties Concord

710
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:14,639
and no you can see um a similar pattern

711
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,880
to the vena and that they decrease with

712
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,600
temperature over time uh but then they

713
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,200
get much more

714
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:25,918
responsive to switches in temperature so

715
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,038
dips uh in low temperature cause dips in

716
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:33,679
the uh DTA so conquor and Rari are able

717
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:35,919
to respond to that cold signal better or

718
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,759
faster than the Venera

719
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,519
cultivar this is what it looks like if

720
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,480
you overlay them just so you can get an

721
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,200
idea now mind you none of these cultivar

722
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,640
experience damage they are all plenty

723
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,759
Hardy but it's still interesting to me

724
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,120
that the hybrid cultivars are able to

725
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:55,398
respond at points when the vener cannot

726
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:59,199
respond or or chooses not to does not

727
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:02,000
respond and so I'm interested in

728
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,840
understanding if that is a trait that

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,720
correlates with the wild germ plasma and

730
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,278
if that's something that we can select

731
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,960
on this is a example of the data that

732
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,079
Tim martinson's group puts puts up for

733
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Farmers so farmers have access to this

734
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,558
data throughout the winter so they can

735
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
make choices about their pruning

736
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:20,038
technique whether or not they need to

737
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,558
account for damage to their Vines and

738
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:26,519
you can see in 2009 2010 cab Fran and

739
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:27,918
reing uh well well below the hardiness

740
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,960
line needed

741
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,440
if you look at kug go white and Concord

742
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,480
to hybrid varieties you can see that

743
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,480
they're much more responsive in the lt50

744
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,640
curves and then if you look in the 2010

745
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,240
2011 season at again at Concord you can

746
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,679
see that's very reactive to

747
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,919
temperatures so I'm really interested in

748
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,440
understanding what the control is of

749
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,080
that ability to move the other thing I

750
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,759
wanted to point out is that these

751
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,278
changes in LTE are temperature

752
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,960
responsive it's not like a age over

753
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,038
winter it's resp responding to

754
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,759
accumulating cold temperature pictured

755
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,079
on the left of this graph graph are

756
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,480
riparia cuting one kept in the cold room

757
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,960
one kept one collected from the field on

758
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,480
the right is voleno same situation cold

759
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,278
room and field and you can see that with

760
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,240
the field exposure to cold the uh LTE

761
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,319
values for the field riparia and the

762
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,319
field vulpina are much much harder much

763
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,918
lower than if they were kept in the cold

764
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,000
room under those dormy uh inducing

765
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,320
conditions

766
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,079
so I want to understand what promotes

767
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,119
the change in hardiness and what the

768
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,839
physiological mechanism is behind

769
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,000
it this is the data from this year uh

770
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,119
looking at LTE values obtained from Wild

771
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,038
germ plasm and you can see the uh

772
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,239
vinifera and and hyrid genotypes are

773
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,759
pictured on the right hand side of the

774
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,640
graph in color all the black um graphs

775
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,798
are or bars are wild germ plasm and you

776
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,559
can see that it far exceeds the ability

777
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:02,200
of Vena at this early point in the

778
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,240
season I've colorcoded uh riparia blue

779
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,240
and vulpen pink here so that you can see

780
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,000
that there's wide variation in the

781
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,000
ability to uh get increased cold hardtin

782
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
within species within riparia we're

783
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,398
seeing six degrees difference between

784
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the samples we're we're looking at and

785
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,319
in voleno we're seeing a 4 degree

786
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,960
difference and I'm wondering if

787
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:27,278
midwinter hardiness and deacclimation

788
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,480
right can be pulled apart this View

789
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,278
raria on the right hand here from Iowa

790
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,919
represents this

791
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,480
-7.6 level of hardiness the one on the

792
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,519
left from anoba represents thetive -

793
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,240
23.5 so the question is if you're super

794
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,720
hearty does that make you always de

795
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,880
acclimate quickly so are these separate

796
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,038
modules that we can select apart or or

797
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
is it one adaptive complex that's been

798
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,638
transmitted through time and so we got

799
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,000
to we're working on figuring that

800
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:00,038
out the last thing I wanted to tell you

801
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,880
about about was um trying to get at the

802
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:05,440
physiology behind what could be in uh

803
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,399
increasing the bud hardiness and so we

804
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,320
looked at whether or not sugar type or

805
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,839
concentration uh could determine cold

806
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,158
hardiness in these four varieties um

807
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,480
that Tim martinson's group works on we

808
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,039
have a lot of data from other perennial

809
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,000
systems and also from grape that

810
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,200
suggests that cold hearty varieties tend

811
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,960
to have higher sugar concentrations and

812
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
that dormant buds um

813
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,600
at least with uh grape tend to

814
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,399
accumulate higher levels of rapanos in

815
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,638
uh hearty buds than in sensitive buds so

816
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,719
we looked at the sugar levels in those

817
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:42,759
four varieties Concord no C Fran and

818
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
reing to see if there's a correlation

819
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,200
between their but hardiness and sugar

820
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,038
throughout the whole

821
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,080
season so the four sugars we look at are

822
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,679
pictured here at the bottom uh glucose

823
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,439
and fructose monosaccharides sucrose is

824
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,720
a disaccharide of of glucose and

825
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,480
fructose and rapanos is a sucrose

826
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,919
molecule with galactose added on um and

827
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,480
so these sort of represent a

828
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,480
carbohydrate pool that could be moving

829
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,839
back and forth uh between trisaccharide

830
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
and monosaccharide States and so we

831
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,839
thought maybe maybe one of these sugars

832
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,200
will tell us something about hardiness

833
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,918
but it could be that it's the flux

834
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,759
between the four that actually have

835
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,038
something to do with

836
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,558
it so this is what it looks like if you

837
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:23,398
look at Sugar concentrations in those

838
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,720
four

839
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:28,479
varieties Cabernet Fran and reing are on

840
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,600
the left side con and no are on the

841
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,159
right and what I want you to notice is

842
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,918
that sugars oscillate greatly throughout

843
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
the season this is the same winter

844
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,320
season that we just looked at but Hurtin

845
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,799
so they go up they go down um they

846
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,158
always seem to go up and down together

847
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:47,839
so there doesn't seem to be a pool

848
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:51,039
tradeoff where we have sucrose

849
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,199
decreasing and then glucose and fructose

850
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,398
increasing but that all the sugars seem

851
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,840
to more or less be moving together the

852
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,759
other thing I want want you to notice is

853
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,439
that Concord and R tend to have much

854
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:06,960
higher sugar levels uh for all sugars as

855
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,480
well as total sugar than the uh to

856
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,599
Vena so if we look just at glucose and

857
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,800
rapanos um you can see what I just

858
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,079
explained that Concord and no Noir have

859
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,679
much higher sugar levels throughout the

860
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,760
entire season and that resling which is

861
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,480
the more hearty of the two vinas also

862
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,679
tends to have more

863
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,358
sugar so it looks like the sugars are

864
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,440
correlated with but

865
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,440
hardiness um but we wanted to test this

866
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,079
by looking at 33 different wild

867
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,918
varieties to see if maybe this is just a

868
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,480
cultivated phenotype or if this is

869
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:45,759
something that occurs across the whole

870
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,480
genus because what we don't see is the

871
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,639
sort of correlation that you would hope

872
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,960
to see between sugar and uh DTA values

873
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:57,480
so pictured here on the left is Concord

874
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,760
on the right is reing um the the the top

875
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,639
colored line is total sugar and I've

876
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,240
just collapsed all four sugars together

877
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,799
because they cycle together and so it's

878
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,399
easier to look at one line than it is to

879
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,000
look at

880
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,559
four um so you can see how sugar total

881
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,079
sugar levels cycle throughout the winter

882
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,320
pictured behind the sugar is the daily

883
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,720
temperatures and then on the bottom is

884
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,240
the lt50 for Concord and so if sugars

885
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,399
were playing a direct role we would

886
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:29,118
expect then as the lt50 decreases in

887
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Concord that we see sugars increase in

888
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,680
opposition if they're the the driving

889
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,400
mechanism we do see that the coldest

890
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,279
point in Concords

891
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,079
hardiness uh correlates with the highest

892
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,560
point in sugar but it's pretty arbitrary

893
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:46,640
difference between the high points if we

894
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,199
look at reeling um we see something very

895
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,199
similar lots of oscillation without

896
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,639
changes in hardiness and no dramatic

897
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,159
increase in hardiness that correlates

898
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,879
with sugar level so it doesn't appear

899
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:01,039
that the sugars are Dr driving

900
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,480
hardiness it does kind of look like

901
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,318
sugars are cycling with winter

902
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,599
temperature and this might just be

903
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,719
because I stare at these all the time

904
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,000
but it looks a little bit to me like at

905
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,480
least in the beginning of the winter

906
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,358
Here Concord seems to be cycling it

907
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,599
sugars along with changes in highs and

908
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,519
lows after our first real cold freeze

909
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,280
the sugars kind of depart from that

910
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,519
pattern and I don't know that may have

911
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,000
something to do with fulfillment of

912
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,960
dorcy or some other physiological mark

913
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,159
that we haven't covered

914
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,079
yet um so right now we're looking to see

915
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,199
if the sugar level correlation falls

916
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,440
apart when we look at lots of different

917
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,719
varieties with lots of different

918
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,200
hardiness levels um and we also need to

919
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,078
make a point of noting that there could

920
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:48,480
be some other environmental parameter

921
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,800
like our winter maybe our winter was it

922
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,000
was awfully warm and perhaps these

923
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,359
correlations start to fall apart in when

924
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,119
you have less severe Winters there's

925
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,440
lots of other parameters that we haven't

926
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,599
considered

927
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,599
yet the final thing I wanted to leave

928
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,920
you with is that these are all

929
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,960
characterization and phenotyping uh

930
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,240
research projects that we're getting off

931
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,920
the ground to try to understand which

932
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,000
traits are the good ones to go after for

933
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,559
breeding we're also taking a genetic

934
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,599
approach to mapping some of these cold

935
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,159
hardiness traits we have several

936
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:22,318
segregating populations between hybrid

937
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,838
varieties and wild varieties um and

938
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:26,400
we'll be screening them for chilling

939
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,318
requirement budburst LTE and osmolite

940
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
level

941
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:32,400
and pictured here is just an example of

942
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,078
what we've been able to look at so far

943
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,318
this is sugar level in one segregating

944
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,839
or one population pictured in the two

945
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:41,599
blue arrows in the bottom left corner

946
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:44,358
are the pr the parents of this cross so

947
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,760
you can see that the two parents produce

948
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:49,400
almost essentially the same amount of

949
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,160
sugar in their buds but their progyny

950
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,480
produce this huge transgressive array of

951
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,078
sugar concentrations and so we're we're

952
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,920
hoping to look into this some more and

953
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,920
see if we can and figure out if we're

954
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,920
starting to pull traits

955
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:06,559
apart so I was just going to wrap up

956
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,358
with that cold stresses um cold stress

957
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,599
and cold hardiness is a suite of traits

958
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:11,519
it's really complicated and we're

959
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,318
working on trying to pull things apart

960
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,599
into manageable bits the wild germplasm

961
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,679
that we have access to uh carries

962
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,119
variation in these traits and we need to

963
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,759
draw on those um traits in order to

964
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,400
improve grape germ plasm you could see

965
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,160
from the cold heartness that cold

966
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,200
heartness of Vena that

967
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,679
both reing and cab Fran kind of go down

968
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,318
in the middle of winter but they table

969
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:36,239
off so there's a lot of opportunity for

970
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:38,119
us to improve uh

971
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,759
Grapevine the mechanism of cold

972
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,640
hardiness really isn't clear at this

973
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,560
point sugar level might have a role in

974
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,960
it but it does not seem to be the driver

975
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,199
at least with one year's worth of

976
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,440
data and please stay tuned this is the

977
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,199
first year I'm hoping to come back

978
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,679
several times and tell you more and more

979
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:59,439
as the story progresses and thank you

980
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,440
for your attention I'd be happy to take

981
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,199
questions well so not with the four that

982
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
we're looking at TH they were all moving

983
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,399
in sync it's possible they're being

984
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,559
hydrolized from starch reserves we did

985
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,559
not look at starch um but that's the

986
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,119
only place that I know where they could

987
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,880
be coming from no that's a great

988
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,519
question and a great point this hasn't

989
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,838
been corrected for anything like that

990
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,519
and the the investigation into the

991
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:36,239
responsiveness for hardiness that we

992
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,239
just initiated that this year so

993
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,399
hopefully I'll be able to give you a

994
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,439
little bit more input on that after this

995
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,119
year the uh the samples that were

996
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,280
running include both male and female

997
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:51,200
Vines um but as you pointed out the our

998
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,240
germ plasm is not run like a Vineyard we

999
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,519
we don't control crop load we don't

1000
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,919
control Vigor at all and so really I

1001
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,759
need to team up a little bit more with a

1002
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,920
viticulturist who could give me a hand

1003
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,680
with understanding that um we could

1004
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,280
probably deploy some things with fruit

1005
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,000
removal in a in a Vineyard setting and

1006
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,000
see how that affects it

1007
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,719
but right now I don't have the answer

1008
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,519
for you

1009
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,078
though so the reason we kept them at 5

1010
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,199
degre C is because that's the the

1011
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,079
temperature of our cold room but the uh

1012
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,239
literature on chilling requirement is

1013
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,039
the chilling portions that perennials

1014
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:32,719
tend to count begin below 7°

1015
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:35,318
C and stop at zero so we want to keep it

1016
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,919
in that sort of sweet spot for uh

1017
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,880
chilling

1018
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,240
fulfillment so we could definitely try

1019
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,000
uh treating at zero over the long term

1020
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,118
um I don't we would have to make sure

1021
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,400
that the plants were acclimated

1022
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,280
sufficiently so they could be held below

1023
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,760
zero

1024
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,880
for you know 2,000 hours but um but it's

1025
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,200
it's a good

1026
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,880
comment okay yeah we could do that we um

1027
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,000
the dry weight just to give you some

1028
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,318
background on the me method there uh we

1029
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,559
tried processing these buds fresh what

1030
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:10,119
well fresh from the LTE experiments and

1031
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,519
found that when we tried to process them

1032
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,880
mechanically process them and grind them

1033
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,920
up and they were wet that we got less

1034
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,800
sugars

1035
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,280
extracted because of the way that the

1036
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,920
grinding was working so we've been

1037
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,160
freeze drying them uh in order to make

1038
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,680
polarization easier but your point it's

1039
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:30,960
good and it would be easy enough for us

1040
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:37,199
to take fresh weights

1041
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:39,318
um yeah I much change water content is

1042
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,679
during the winter yeah it's it's

1043
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,480
probably pretty slight give because

1044
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:48,039
these buds are very tiny and they weigh

1045
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,679
very little to begin with but it makes

1046
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:53,759
sense that if they're increasing their

1047
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:56,719
osmo lights yeah I think that's very

1048
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,160
interesting question I don't know if um

1049
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:02,318
root stocks impact Scion hardiness but

1050
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,679
it would be neat to try maybe graph the

1051
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,358
same s onto a bunch of different root

1052
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:10,799
stocks and watch

1053
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:13,000
um based on based on what we expect the

1054
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,079
buds to be going through in Winter

1055
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,199
they're they're more or less

1056
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,599
physiologically sealed off from the cane

1057
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:23,439
um hopefully they're responding on their

1058
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,880
own and if that case if that's true then

1059
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,920
I guess you wouldn't expect root stock

1060
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,200
to contribute much except for root socks

1061
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,039
could be contributing much through the

1062
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,318
growing season

1063
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,880
so we could definitely test

1064
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:38,239
it yeah no I I think you're right it's

1065
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,480
it's another trait we could be looking

1066
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,639
at and having an impact on it I haven't

1067
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,000
looked on it um mostly because I don't

1068
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:50,000
know a whole lot about wood physiology

1069
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,960
and it's a I'm a work in progress but um

1070
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,358
it it makes sense that if you had

1071
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,760
greater capacity to transport

1072
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:58,480
carbohydrates that perhaps you could

1073
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,240
elevate that level prior to Winter and

1074
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,760
come start off at a hardier level um the

1075
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,919
only thing I would say is that we expect

1076
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,160
that the buds are not drawing on the

1077
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,200
cane tissue so much throughout the

1078
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,920
winter once they've once they've shut

1079
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,318
down the parader has moved through the

1080
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,039
leaves of siness we're not expecting

1081
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,440
there to be a ton of

1082
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:22,199
communication metabolically or uh

1083
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,480
molecularly going on but we don't know

1084
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,719
so I'm hoping for that sooner rather

1085
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,119
than later um I don't know when the I

1086
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,959
don't think it's so much the price point

1087
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,920
um it's

1088
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,920
untangling how messed up the genetics of

1089
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,358
grap Vine actually is so if you look at

1090
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,318
VRA it's super

1091
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,519
heterozygous these are combinations that

1092
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,880
were formed a long time ago and

1093
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,280
preserved in a state um so when you

1094
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,318
compare between varieties we run into a

1095
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,319
lot of problems um just mapping known

1096
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:55,880
genes because they move inversions

1097
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,039
deletions this sort of thing when we

1098
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,400
move move to the wild species you know

1099
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,920
it just gets crazier from there I can

1100
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,240
tell you that we're all the whole ggu

1101
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,680
group is interested in pushing forward

1102
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,199
um sequencing in these wild species and

1103
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,598
we we've been working on it trying to

1104
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,960
get some of the wild species as a

1105
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,960
reference genome so that we can when we

1106
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,639
do those mapping populations we need to

1107
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,838
be able to mark U map the markers and at

1108
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,639
this point we still lose a lot of

1109
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:27,039
markers because there's no reference

1110
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:29,838
location for them in Vena so we're

1111
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,440
working on it I certainly hope it's in

1112
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,880
the next years or

1113
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,760
so we did the the Iowa ripar is in there

1114
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,000
and then we also um we had one from

1115
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,280
Quebec in that study as well that's not

1116
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,559
South but I thought our experiment

1117
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,359
wasn't working when I got that data um

1118
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,559
because the Manitoba rip areia went so

1119
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,759
quickly um we have collaborators in

1120
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,000
South Dakota who also work with this

1121
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,520
riparia and there riparia takes 1,500

1122
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
hours our experiment it took nothing and

1123
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:00,759
so we we kind of put our heads together

1124
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and thinking about that and one thing to

1125
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,599
note is that there's chilling going on

1126
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,679
before we get the cuting it's not a not

1127
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,240
anywhere near 2,000 hours but every

1128
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:13,719
night it gets cold it's that clock is

1129
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,239
going they're counting so depending on

1130
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:20,039
how your fall transition from Summer to

1131
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:22,118
Winter is how steep that transition is

1132
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,800
that can really change what that zero

1133
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,480
point is and so what we came up with is

1134
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,640
in South Dakota where you the rapid

1135
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,679
transition it's hot hot hot shortfall

1136
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:33,239
deep into

1137
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,598
winter it counts a lot slower because it

1138
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,358
can only count every time that comes

1139
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,000
back above zero 0 and seven you know so

1140
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:43,318
takes a lot longer under that climate

1141
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,559
here we have a lot of cool nights so it

1142
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,239
starts counting way before we can

1143
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,480
actually go to The Germ plasma and make

1144
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,439
dormant cuttings so that's what our

1145
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,960
thought is with why something so

1146
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,679
Northern would appear to not need

1147
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,079
chilling at all I think it really does

1148
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:03,078
need chilling it just starts that clock

1149
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,640
much earlier than we are able to measure

1150
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,920
so this year we've got we're counting

1151
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,358
chilling hours prior to our zero point

1152
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,920
to see if that changes our scale at all

1153
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,679
um and we're doing it a across a much

1154
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,440
wider uh swath

1155
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:24,358
zero yeah yeah November 7th was was when

1156
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,079
we did it because we we need to wait for

1157
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:27,558
the plants to go dormant enough they

1158
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,359
drop their leaves that we can go out and

1159
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,200
cut cuttings from our germ plasm they

1160
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:37,119
drop their leaves earlier than Iowa some

1161
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,118
rip areas are are very

1162
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,440
photo if they're if they're clock well

1163
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,680
that's if the clock if the photo

1164
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,519
receptor clock is tied into the cold

1165
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:55,078
clock in that case and some rares are

1166
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,880
very photoresponsive and they drop their

1167
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,000
leaves well in advance of the first

1168
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,318
Frost and others hang on to it and I

1169
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,480
don't think I have that data from our

1170
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:07,039
germ Plasma in this year in this year's

1171
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,679
study we expanded the riparius to

1172
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,440
include we have one population from

1173
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,440
Texas so we've got excuse me Texas and

1174
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,400
Iowa and Manitoba and we're hoping to

1175
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,079
see things start to pull apart

1176
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,519
there I saw it this year too uh our

1177
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,880
Asian varieties amurensis bursts very

1178
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:28,639
early and so they were all leafed out

1179
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,960
when we had that uh that scary Frost and

1180
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,598
the veneros were still quiet they they

1181
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,639
were safe but I did see a lot of burning

1182
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,160
on the stuff that had burst in our um

1183
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,480
germ plasm and I agree with you

1184
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,598
completely in that within a Vine you

1185
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,800
could go out there and it was almost

1186
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,280
like like here it took out all six Buds

1187
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,119
and this whole Vine over here is totally

1188
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,920
fine and then in the next Vine over it's

1189
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,039
every other bud and I don't I can't

1190
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,318
think of any reason that there would be

1191
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,838
sight to sight location differences I

1192
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:03,239
suppose there could be something along

1193
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:04,880
the lines where certain buds incurred of

1194
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,479
non-lethal amount of damage through the

1195
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,440
winter which makes them more susceptible

1196
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,838
to frost in the spring so they're just

1197
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,960
weaker bursts and to us they look fine

1198
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:17,639
um I do think the microclimate is a

1199
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:20,358
possibility if you get um an Eddy or

1200
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,838
just a local drop of a few percents of a

1201
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:26,799
degree it might be enough to cause that

1202
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,960
lethal um symptom so

1203
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,920
yeah I'm not

1204
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,400
sure we would have to C we would have to

1205
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:38,800
categorize it right yeah

1206
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,559
there may actually have some Clues yeah

1207
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,440
that's ultimately what want what I would

1208
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,400
love to be able to say I deployed was

1209
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,159
grape vines that have green choots that

1210
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,318
come out in the frost in the early

1211
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:52,078
spring and it doesn't matter what Frost

1212
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:54,239
you get they have a greater capacity to

1213
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,519
shrug it off

1214
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,838
so that's going to take a couple more

1215
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:58,838
years

1216
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,079
though thanks
