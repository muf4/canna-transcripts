1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,179
University so the first thing I want to

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,330
do is to thank all of you for coming

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:12,480
this afternoon it's a pleasure to to be

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,910
here and in the next I would say a

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,138
little over than half an hour 40 minutes

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,410
I'd like to talk a little bit about

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,539
micro Z and I'm pretty sure most of you

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,109
are familiar with mycorrhizae and I see

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,070
some familiar faces here who work with

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,009
mycorrhizae so I'd like to approach this

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,770
area from commercial standpoint a little

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,369
bit so you would have an idea of you

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,809
know at my kreizel applications how we

15
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:43,709
handle this topic and what kind of

16
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:46,859
research we do here so just as an

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,340
introduction my cry self and I formed

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,829
symbiosis with plants and most of the

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,350
plants have this ability to form

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,820
symbiosis over 90% of the land plants

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,300
reported to form symbiosis and they live

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,090
in the soil and they interact with the

23
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:11,039
roots so they don't go to the leaves and

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,320
any other part of the plan my crazy

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,450
provides a better absorption of

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,449
nutrients and increase the water uptake

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,710
to the plant and this is the benefit so

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,978
where the plant from the mycorrhizae

29
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:26,569
however this is not free so the fungus

30
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:30,719
requires from the plans to provide

31
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:35,099
carbon in return so this is some kind of

32
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,019
a holistic relationship a symbiosis

33
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,309
between the plant and the fungus where

34
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:43,349
both of both of the participants have

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,890
benefits they cannot function without

36
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:49,978
living plants and this is very important

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,680
from commercial standpoint when when you

38
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:55,140
apply like microcell inoculum and

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,939
there's no plant in the soil you don't

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,549
really see the benefits of mycorrhizae

41
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:03,569
because there's no plant to interact

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,659
with the fungus no way the plants

43
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:10,049
control this symbiosis so when the

44
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,110
plants are under stressful conditions by

45
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,790
drought stress or nutrient stress they

46
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,760
produce

47
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:19,280
exudates that triggers microspores to

48
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:25,759
germinate so this is how you know the

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:28,539
symbiosis starts to form they increase

50
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,489
the nutrient and the water absorption

51
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:33,310
Twitter plants by increasing the

52
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:36,200
absorption so and this is not just

53
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:40,069
increasing the root biomass biomass but

54
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:43,339
also for a mycelium around the root zone

55
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:45,949
that actually expands or extends this

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,319
absorption area and I'm gonna have a

57
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:54,078
couple of slides about this you know

58
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:55,789
what the details are but this aspects so

59
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,030
they increase the tolerance to various

60
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:02,298
stressors like drought stress so it's

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,919
stress in every stress heavy metal

62
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,359
toxicity and I'm gonna talk a little bit

63
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,909
about this as well and there are

64
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:11,750
different types of micro I see that

65
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:14,328
exist and so the most important ones are

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,829
endo mycorrhizae or vascular micro I see

67
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:20,870
they got their name after their

68
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,400
relationship structural relationship

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,310
with the plant so actually they

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,109
penetrate inside the cortical cells of

71
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,060
the plant roots that's why they are

72
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:32,299
called endo mycorrhizae because they go

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,128
inside the cells they are called Airbus

74
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,739
Keeler my crazy as well and most of the

75
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:39,348
agricultural horticultural plants belong

76
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:44,239
to this category or foreign symbiosis

77
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:46,698
with this type of micro I see there's

78
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,969
another type of mycorrhizae called ecto

79
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:51,680
mycorrhizae that actually do not

80
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:55,639
penetrate inside a cortical cells they

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,010
form a mental around the roots and they

82
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,760
form the symbiosis or they or their

83
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,318
hyphy in the intracellular spaces of the

84
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,280
roots and they are acting micro I see

85
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:11,149
they they live in symbiosis with

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,158
hardwoods forests trees vines spruces

87
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,108
for example there's a very specific kind

88
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,310
actually a subtype of actor microns II

89
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,829
accidental mycorrhizae

90
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:27,290
they represent only a very tiny portion

91
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:29,389
of the plans and the symbiosis or

92
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,520
kids have a specific type of my crazy

93
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,740
they're called orchid mycorrhizae so

94
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,310
they do not form symbiosis with actor

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:41,379
Mike rising for example ericaceous

96
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,879
plants like blueberries azalea or

97
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,370
rhododendron they form symbiosis with

98
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:51,139
ericaceous mycorrhizae that's a very

99
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:57,199
specific type of micro Z and there are

100
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:59,719
very great tiny portions like only one

101
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,240
genus or one blend species that corn

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,070
symbiosis with Buddhist plants or ma non

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,530
troppo the ghost plant they represent

104
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:10,250
only a very tiny portion so these are

105
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:12,469
just to mention but but the main types

106
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,209
are under my crazy and XO my crazy and

107
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,250
I'm gonna talk a little bit about these

108
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:22,159
today focusing on endo my crisis so when

109
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,529
we talk about endo mycorrhizae we know

110
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,920
that they formed symbiosis with a large

111
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:31,459
number of plants over 80% of the plants

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,129
form symbiosis with them and as I

113
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:36,199
mentioned they colonize the roots inside

114
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,889
there what color eyes the plants inside

115
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,379
the roots and so it's not that easy to

116
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,599
recognize just by looking at the plants

117
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,659
if the plant is colonized or not so what

118
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,410
we have to do is we have to collect the

119
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,680
roots clear them stain them and evaluate

120
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:59,060
them under the microscope and so this is

121
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,490
just an example how a prepared root

122
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,449
sample looks like so when we when we

123
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:08,269
clear the roots and and stain them this

124
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:11,240
is what we see that there's practically

125
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:13,519
nothing really nothing interesting in

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:19,009
the roots however when we look at a root

127
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:21,740
with mycorrhizae but you can see that to

128
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,199
see different structures inside the

129
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,310
roots these are spores and vesicles that

130
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:35,139
are storage organs for the mycorrhizae

131
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:38,839
and also mycelium inside the roots and

132
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,569
Arbus Chios so these are tiny like tree

133
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,789
like structure

134
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,579
that are actually responsible for the

135
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,060
exchange of nutrients between the fungus

136
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,060
and the flam's

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,960
and yeah basically this is how we

138
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,860
evaluate different plants to detect the

139
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:02,529
presence of my cries there's another

140
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,230
kind of mycorrhizae ecto mycorrhizae

141
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,439
that form symbiosis with less than 10%

142
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,430
of plant species and the major host

143
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:15,519
bands are coniferous or D seduce trees

144
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:19,750
Cruz spruces pine trees that form

145
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:24,219
symbiosis and these are actually

146
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:27,490
mushrooms that form fruiting bodies in

147
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,280
the forest so when you walk in the

148
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,900
forest and you see different trees you

149
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,689
see that ecto mycorrhizae or or

150
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,479
mushrooms form on the surface of the

151
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:41,019
ground and they are every time it's

152
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,990
connected interconnected with with the

153
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:48,430
plants around them so that's a very

154
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,620
interesting phenomenon and when we

155
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,129
compare the ecto mycorrhizae and endo

156
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,829
mycorrhizae in terms of appearance you

157
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,500
can actually see that the difference in

158
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:05,279
root morphology because the roots

159
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:10,329
normally look a bit different so this is

160
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:13,269
a very nice example the fly agaric for

161
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,959
ecto mycorrhizae and and then you look

162
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:16,870
at the roots

163
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,750
these are colonized by Ekta mycorrhizae

164
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,569
and usually this notorious in this case

165
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,769
and this is non colonized so it actually

166
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:30,250
really visible in in case of ecto Micra

167
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:32,590
see how larger the root could be or how

168
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,200
their morphology could change just by

169
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,360
the colonization of this fungus and this

170
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,370
really helps in increasing the

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,620
absorption area of the roots and taking

172
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,200
up more nutrients and water from the

173
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,250
soil

174
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,560
when you look at take a look at the

175
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,240
roots and this is particularly true for

176
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,059
endo mycorrhizae so these are their

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,060
roots and and these are the fungal

178
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,679
mycelium or or or hike the around the

179
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,708
roots and some spores

180
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,319
what you can see as well so the

181
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,419
mycorrhizae form this symbiosis and they

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,050
live inside the roots and also outside

183
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:13,259
the roots they form some species can

184
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,000
form spores outside the roots and some

185
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:21,059
species inside the roots as most of them

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,470
actually do both so when we talk about

187
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:29,698
mycorrhizae from commercial standpoint

188
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,449
growers always ask why why by plants

189
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:35,458
leave my crazy so they have roots and

190
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:37,769
couldn't just they take up nutrients and

191
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:43,219
water efficiently without mycorrhizae

192
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:47,870
and so we try to explain the difference

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,370
the structural and functional benefits

194
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,560
what mycorrhizae can provide when we

195
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,129
compare the root hair and the micro

196
00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:00,059
fungal hyphae so when we look at the

197
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:02,578
roots this is a plant root here and this

198
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,409
is the root hair that actually is

199
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:08,189
responsible for taking up most of the

200
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:10,948
nutrients and the water and the maximum

201
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,860
length of the root hair is only a few

202
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:17,458
millimetres so that's that's a very tiny

203
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,680
area or so or soil volume that they can

204
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:22,828
explore to take up the nutrients and the

205
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:27,349
water and the good ion absorption occurs

206
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:30,599
only at the root tips so the absorption

207
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,620
is only at the root tips so that's a

208
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:40,769
very tiny area for nutrient and water

209
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:43,139
update and another important thing that

210
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,240
we have to consider is that the nutrient

211
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:49,409
uptake is normally from the available or

212
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:53,850
for easily soluble pool of the soil and

213
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:56,889
of the soil nutrients and I'm gonna talk

214
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,100
a little bit about it in a minute and

215
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:02,409
of this tiny absorption area at the root

216
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,959
tips the nutrient inflow into the roots

217
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:08,528
is normally slower much slower than my

218
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,768
cries oh hi see cuz when we when we look

219
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:15,399
at the micro eyes or high feet or that

220
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:20,139
network of microns on - the roots we see

221
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:24,578
a huge difference from from plant roots

222
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:28,659
because what you can see here is this is

223
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:33,938
a root a feeder root that is responsible

224
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:37,838
for for nutrient uptake and this network

225
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:41,318
of mycelium rounded or mycorrhizae and

226
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,679
what you have to see here is that

227
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:46,599
maximum length could be up to two feet

228
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:50,409
so basically what happens is they can

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,629
extend this depletion zone we call the

230
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:55,269
depletion zone where the nutrients and

231
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,639
the water uptake occurs by two feet

232
00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:01,360
which is which could be extremely

233
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,918
important under drought conditions the

234
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,949
nutrient and the water absorption occurs

235
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:08,350
along the entire length of the hyphy so

236
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:11,318
it's not just the tips but the entire

237
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,168
length to take up nutrients and water so

238
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:18,578
that's a it's a huge increase in

239
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:21,428
absorption area mineral nutrient uptake

240
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:24,789
from the soluble and insoluble fou so I

241
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:30,028
just have to mention that they produce

242
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:34,238
enzymes like phosphatases that helps

243
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:36,068
solubilizing phosphate and easier to

244
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:38,168
take up for the plants and also they

245
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:41,639
take up nutrients and transport it to

246
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:45,220
the plant as well and because of this

247
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,369
increased absorption area or absorptive

248
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,860
area the nutrient inflow into the high

249
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:54,189
feet and from the high key to the plan

250
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,999
it's much faster much quicker compared

251
00:12:54,188 --> 00:13:00,938
to the root of pig so this is why and

252
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:04,389
this is how my crazy increases the

253
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:06,110
nutrients and the water uptake of the

254
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:09,440
plant

255
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,779
and under field conditions when we when

256
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,670
we look at you know mycorrhizae you know

257
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,169
and how it works and and this is what I

258
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:18,079
was just talking about that there's a

259
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,939
root zone where you know major if it's

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,460
soil volume where the major it a of the

261
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,510
roots are located on and take up the

262
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:30,740
nutrients and the water and what my

263
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,439
crazy does it extends is soil volume and

264
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,269
this is how they can provide benefits

265
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,910
and this is very important for those

266
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,769
nutrients that are relatively that have

267
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:42,079
a relatively low mobility like

268
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:45,769
phosphorus primarily and some of the

269
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,000
micronutrients because they cannot just

270
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:51,799
move easily into that depletion zone so

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,860
that's that's very important and yes

272
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,929
this is very helpful for the plant and

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,600
then again this is for field conditions

274
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:02,059
so when there's a possibility for the

275
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:08,149
roots or the mycorrhizae to explore a

276
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:13,099
larger soil however there are certain

277
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:16,399
conditions when and there's just no it's

278
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,009
not an option to explore a larger soil

279
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,929
volume because there's just no more soil

280
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,990
and this is particularly true for

281
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,959
spotting conditions when and the plants

282
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,330
are grown in a pot and and they form

283
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,290
these these roots and you know these are

284
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:35,600
ruined by root bound situations so my

285
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,019
crazy steel provides the benefits even

286
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,690
though there's there's no larger soy

287
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,149
poem to explore so they produce enzymes

288
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,410
that convert nutrients into bioavailable

289
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,220
form so I just mentioned the

290
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:49,789
phosphatases

291
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,670
and they also trigger the production of

292
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:57,079
solubilizing enzymes by the plant roots

293
00:14:52,669 --> 00:15:00,169
so they increase this activity through

294
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,160
the plant and they also work together

295
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:06,169
with other soil microorganisms and very

296
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,689
insoluble minerals into soluble forms so

297
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:11,059
these are called micro as our helper

298
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,530
bacteria for example that live together

299
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:19,448
in symbiosis with the mycorrhizae and

300
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:25,168
helped solubilizing non-soluble

301
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:28,448
nutrients and due to these mechanisms

302
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:32,350
they reduced nutrient leaching out of

303
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:36,698
the parts and there's an excellent study

304
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:39,009
that actually looked at the effect of

305
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:41,349
micro appliqu micro SD micro fungal

306
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:44,649
application on in potting soil

307
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,659
conditions when they grew ornamental

308
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,789
plants and they looked at nitrogen or

309
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:51,879
nitrate and order phosphate leaching out

310
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,738
of the plants and this is a bit sly or

311
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,539
this is a busy slide with three graphs

312
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:57,668
what what I just want to point out here

313
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:00,909
that these are these graphs show

314
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:05,139
different fertilizer levels so Osmocote

315
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:08,558
is a fertilizer

316
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:11,318
it's a slow-release fertilizer and then

317
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:15,818
half rate and full rate of fertilisers

318
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:20,558
so what you can see here is that the

319
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:24,278
white diamonds on the top in all graphs

320
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:27,298
show that when my crazy was not applied

321
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:31,778
let's say untreated control and black

322
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:34,239
diamonds with black squares show the my

323
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:36,999
crazy application so you can compare the

324
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:39,910
amount of nitrate leached out of the

325
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:42,538
pots so this shows that Mike just by the

326
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:46,480
application of my cries of fungus and I

327
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:48,428
reduced the leaching or practically the

328
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,579
leaching of nitrogen where or or the

329
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:54,568
loss of nitrogen in these conditions so

330
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:59,108
this is very important that that

331
00:16:54,568 --> 00:17:00,878
mycorrhizae helps a better absorption of

332
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:03,189
the nutrients to the plants and the

333
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,649
plants can utilize these and and it's a

334
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:08,648
similar trend with art of order

335
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:12,849
phosphate so this is a phosphorus source

336
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:16,000
same thing without mycorrhizae the

337
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:20,438
phosphorus the amount of phosphorus that

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,949
leached out of the pot was I would say

339
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,519
about twice as much as with mycorrhizae

340
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:31,028
so this is this is something that is

341
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,039
very important and not just in poor

342
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:36,429
conditions but also

343
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:40,029
sites we're quite leaching of nutrients

344
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:46,048
into the soil or the or the waters is a

345
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:48,099
problem so we talked a little bit about

346
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,599
plants that form symbiosis with

347
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,779
mycorrhizae but there are some plants

348
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:56,079
that do not form this symbiosis they

349
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:58,720
just don't have the ability and prime

350
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,699
examples are the brassy KCA family plans

351
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,350
like cabbage broccoli kale cauliflower

352
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,630
mustard so these are these are very good

353
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:09,819
examples they just don't do not form

354
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,919
this symbiosis and there are different

355
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:15,970
hypotheses why they do not form this

356
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,919
symbiosis the most probable reason is

357
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:22,919
that they lost through the evolution

358
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:26,350
their ability to form this symbiosis

359
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:29,910
beats also a good example spinach as

360
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:33,250
well from Horniman toast carnation is

361
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:36,340
also a good example for the plants that

362
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:40,990
do not form this simplest type of

363
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:44,199
seniors and agreed some weeds as well so

364
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:50,759
you can find examples from every areas

365
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:56,200
of the plant and but these are the most

366
00:18:50,759 --> 00:19:01,329
important ones and when we when we try

367
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:05,080
to explain you know why my Kreisler mike

368
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:07,599
rizzo inoculum and mike rizzo

369
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:11,319
inoculation is important and how we do

370
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:14,079
it in in in commercial situations we

371
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:18,279
normally talk about inoculant technology

372
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:22,928
and i summarized the basics here on this

373
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:26,319
slide so when we talk about inoculation

374
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,169
what we do is we provide a direct

375
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,139
contact of the roots with the micro eyes

376
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:36,220
of fungal inoculum we call it proper

377
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:39,009
gills because these are structures that

378
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,819
could be used to propagate or reenact

379
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:45,158
you late the plants with my crazy so

380
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:46,839
these are spores and colonized root

381
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,450
fragments that we normally

382
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,970
referred to in commercial practice and

383
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,700
I'm gonna have a slide on this so it's

384
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,640
very important to have a close or direct

385
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,400
contact of the inoculum with the roots

386
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:05,620
because the root exudates trigger and

387
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,690
the mike rizzo spores to germinate my

388
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,399
cries of colonization lasts in most

389
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,910
cases for the life of the plants

390
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,700
so in perennial crops this means that

391
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:19,180
you have to inoculate only once in their

392
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,370
life and this inoculation could take

393
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,630
place at any time the best you know when

394
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:29,529
the there's active root growth but with

395
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,790
annual plants you have to renovate the

396
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,369
plants we're not reading actually just

397
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,559
do the inoculation every time when you

398
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:41,259
see it or when there's a new crop coming

399
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:43,480
up the most economic benefits and best

400
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,549
physiological responses can be achieved

401
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,190
by early application so what do you what

402
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,409
do I mean by death it means that you

403
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,289
know the earlier you apply the

404
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,790
mycorrhizae the most benefits you're

405
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,009
gonna get out because there's gonna be a

406
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,980
longer period of time for the my crazy

407
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:02,769
to provide the benefits and also in in

408
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:07,539
in commercial conditions what happens is

409
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:09,759
we have a recommended rate like X number

410
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:12,819
of profit use to apply for plant and

411
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,160
when the plants are smaller you have a

412
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:18,159
smaller root zone so you can get away

413
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,180
with smaller amounts of microcell

414
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,820
inoculum to get the same colonization or

415
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,190
the same inoculum benefits so that's

416
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,869
it's not just cheaper but its measured

417
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,680
better from from physiological

418
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:35,109
standpoint as well we normally say that

419
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,970
it requires one month three forty weeks

420
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:40,179
for the symbiosis to establish well

421
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,490
established on the roots and two months

422
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:46,269
seven or eight weeks to see the benefits

423
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,269
from inoculations so when when we are

424
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,519
talking about these timeframes we have

425
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:55,000
to consider you know from commercial

426
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:58,240
standpoint that when we try to apply

427
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,759
mycorrhizae in a crop that that is only

428
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,279
like a very short cycle

429
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,900
like three or four weeks we might not be

430
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,730
able to see the benefits because there's

431
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:12,540
just not enough time for the micro Z to

432
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,539
provide this extra benefit to the plant

433
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,760
and the good thing is you cannot

434
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:21,569
overdose Big Mike Rice or fungi because

435
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:29,740
they just gonna sit in the soil and and

436
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:32,460
even bye-bye some animals in the soil

437
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,179
but you know if the plants don't need

438
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,808
this symbiosis

439
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:42,519
they just won't form the seniors they

440
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:45,759
just won't germinate in the soil there

441
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,789
are four main benefits that that we

442
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,879
normally mention when we talk about mike

443
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:55,409
rizzo inoculant and one is increased

444
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,130
root growth so they extend the

445
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:02,019
absorption area you know by this

446
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:06,130
formation of mycelium but also at the

447
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:08,048
same time they help in increasing the

448
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,630
root biomass and this is particularly

449
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:12,940
important in those crops where the where

450
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,760
the root is the yield so for example in

451
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,308
potato onion and carrots we see great

452
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:24,129
benefits of using my crazy to increase

453
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:26,410
the root biomass increased nutrient and

454
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,230
water uptake so this is through day

455
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,860
through the increased absorption area

456
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:35,679
and also increasing the bioavailability

457
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:37,119
of nutrients and allowing for reduced

458
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,490
irrigation and better fertilizer

459
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:44,829
efficiency so there are several papers

460
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,419
out there that shows the benefits of you

461
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:50,769
know applying mycorrhizae with reduced

462
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:54,309
rates of fertilizers but as a company we

463
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:56,019
are not really allowed to say that you

464
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,548
can reduce the fertilizer because you

465
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,220
know if you promote let's say a micro

466
00:23:57,548 --> 00:24:02,259
inoculant other companies we're not

467
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,120
getting any benefits by you know selling

468
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:09,000
fertilizer products so we have to be

469
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:13,629
very careful how we word you know these

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,680
claims but what we can say is that the

471
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,080
increase

472
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:23,380
or improve the nutrient absorption

473
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:26,049
efficiency of the planet increased

474
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,590
stress tolerance under drought heat and

475
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:34,869
toxic levels of minerals and so it's

476
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:39,039
very it's a very interesting phenomenon

477
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:41,229
what how mycorrhizae can help in in

478
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,569
alleviating toxic levels of minerals

479
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:47,920
because what happens is the mic rise of

480
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:51,549
fungi take up the nutrients the the

481
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,740
toxic nutrients from the soil but they

482
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:55,419
just don't transport it to the plant so

483
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,609
this is how they actually protect the

484
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,310
plants because what happens is if the

485
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:02,889
plant senses that you know there is no

486
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:05,889
benefit of this symbiosis or this

487
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,830
relationship then they just try to shut

488
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,870
down this again is amore this symbiosis

489
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:14,919
so that's why the the fungus won't

490
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:16,449
really transport these toxic levels of

491
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,570
minerals to the plants otherwise the

492
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:24,269
plant would shut down the symbiosis and

493
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:26,970
reduce the transplant shop so

494
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:31,960
transplanting is the most stressful

495
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:35,890
condition or or face in the you know in

496
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:40,559
a in a plant's life and the application

497
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:45,040
of my crazy really helps and and and

498
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,929
under these stressful conditions but as

499
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,089
I mentioned here best if inoculate is

500
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,310
there before transplanting because so

501
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:57,099
remember it takes like three four weeks

502
00:25:51,309 --> 00:26:00,099
for the symbiosis to form and we apply

503
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:02,469
the mycorrhizae had a seeding stage so

504
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:05,079
by the time the transplanting happens

505
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,809
the mycorrhizae is there and can provide

506
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:14,199
the benefits so that's that's an

507
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:17,440
important there are other documented

508
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,809
benefits that I I just want to briefly

509
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,090
mention here is increased tolerance to

510
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:24,309
pests and pathogens so here's a

511
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,179
resistance called systemic resistance

512
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,549
called

513
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,240
micro rise induced resistance there are

514
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,000
several

515
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,380
occasions out there that shows that for

516
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,960
example chewing insects are one of their

517
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,760
targets so when mycorrhizae colonizes

518
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,710
the plans the plans become more

519
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:46,420
resistant to these insects for example

520
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,880
but these are this is not something that

521
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,100
you can find on a product label for the

522
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,770
micro eyes of products because this is

523
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:56,379
not well this requires this would

524
00:26:53,769 --> 00:27:00,339
require registration as a pesticide

525
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:03,570
product which micro IC is not and there

526
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:05,619
are also more effective more efficient

527
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:08,470
solutions out there like different

528
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:10,000
pesticides or insecticides that can take

529
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,519
care of the problem we just mentioned

530
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,950
here that this is something that you can

531
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,200
consider as a positive that's a side

532
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:21,299
benefit but these are not really so

533
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:25,240
mycorrhizae micro riser is not really

534
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:30,069
applied to to solve these problems or to

535
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,470
control insects for example another very

536
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:36,970
important aspect that seed production

537
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:40,690
and offspring fertility it's been

538
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:43,480
noticed that when there's a plant that

539
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,870
is colonized by mycorrhizae and is

540
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,579
producing seeds the seeds from these

541
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,678
mother plants are gonna have a better

542
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:53,169
fertility and a better germination rate

543
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,030
compared to those that came from mother

544
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,390
plants that were not colonized by my

545
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,009
cries so this has something to do with

546
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:03,040
the increased nutrient and phosphorus

547
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:05,319
content of the seeds and this is just

548
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,849
something that is that is very

549
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,710
interesting to dimension also increase

550
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:14,469
secondary metabolite production in some

551
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,450
plants they positively affect active

552
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:22,539
ingredient production of medicine or

553
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:26,380
plants there are several studies showing

554
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:29,139
that terpenes panels and alkaloids are

555
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,140
increased by after the application of

556
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,470
micro I see

557
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,420
and last but not least increased soil

558
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:42,610
quality so the production of aluminum

559
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:44,830
this is a compound that increase the

560
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:47,589
aggregation of soil particles so this is

561
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:55,029
very important to to maintain and

562
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:57,009
improve the soil health by my cries so

563
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:59,259
why is my cry so inoculation beneficial

564
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:01,450
and normally under certain under natural

565
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:04,480
conditions my crazy is always in the

566
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:07,919
soil there's just a wide range of

567
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,079
species there and they provide benefits

568
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,940
but there are growing conditions that

569
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:16,480
are harmful to mycorrhizae so for

570
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,429
example fumigation over fertilization

571
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,740
with nitrogen or phosphorus are

572
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:25,679
especially detrimental to my cries and

573
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,759
you know like tillage following and

574
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,700
stressful environments particularly

575
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,769
roadsides when they put a lot of salt

576
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,370
out you know around the roads in the

577
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:39,150
winter just to melt the ice that is very

578
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:41,439
harmful to mycorrhizae and certainly

579
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,419
artificial growing media they just by

580
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,289
nature don't contain any my crazy and

581
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:51,070
they can they can be my crazy can be

582
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:52,690
applied under these conditions and so

583
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:54,939
once they deplete it in the soy just

584
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,620
takes time for the natural population to

585
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,400
build up again and that's why it's

586
00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:04,178
important to to apply my crazy and these

587
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:09,040
are just a few photos that to illustrate

588
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:11,769
where my crazy could be beneficial so in

589
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,928
fumigated soils fumigation cures most of

590
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:16,298
the soil microorganisms over

591
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:19,870
fertilization is not positive

592
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:23,308
particularly nitrogen phosphorus for

593
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:25,928
mycorrhizae and bare-root trees or

594
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:29,668
transplants are particularly good

595
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:32,790
subjects for the use of of mycorrhizae

596
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:35,230
and artificial growing media it's

597
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,308
something where there's micro Z

598
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,308
naturally it's not there

599
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,029
specificity of mycorrhizae so there's a

600
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:47,089
great deal of variability and let me

601
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:49,250
know that one species of my crazy can

602
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:54,319
form the symbiosis with multiple species

603
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:56,569
of plants and at the same time one plant

604
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,460
roots could form symbiosis with

605
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:00,619
different species of my crazy so there's

606
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,840
there's just a great deal of variability

607
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:04,549
but there are different species that are

608
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,250
responsible for different functional

609
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:09,559
benefits so one species is better for

610
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:15,049
phosphorus update however other species

611
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:17,480
of my crazy is better to increase heavy

612
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,029
metal toxicity or to increase the

613
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,940
tolerance to heavy metal toxicity so

614
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:26,299
there are differences in terms of

615
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:30,100
species and fungal species change with

616
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:32,779
plant phenology and plant physiology so

617
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:34,549
the the composition or the chemical

618
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:38,450
composition of the root exudates change

619
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:40,250
over time and even within the season and

620
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:43,750
also the environment and conditions

621
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:47,119
change so that the community composition

622
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:50,509
changes during the season I'm gonna have

623
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,869
a slide about it so that's why the

624
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:56,059
diversity of mike rizzo inoculants or

625
00:31:53,869 --> 00:32:00,169
microbial inoculants is important to

626
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,909
provide a range of species and so under

627
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:05,990
different conditions different species

628
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:09,920
can provide different benefits and this

629
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:12,009
is just a quick review of one of the

630
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,110
products actually that mike rizzo

631
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:17,529
application sells it's my co-pilot

632
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:20,299
contains four different species where we

633
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:25,549
compiled a or reviewed the literature

634
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:32,359
and you know 600 papers and we just

635
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:33,829
collected or listed those that that you

636
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,349
know what species is responsible for

637
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:38,119
what functional benefits and you can see

638
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:41,269
that you know different different

639
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:46,189
species provide different benefits and

640
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:48,769
for example in in case of Glomus ma CA

641
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,779
in nutrient optic enzyme activity

642
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:53,329
increase increases access my

643
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:55,309
to nutrient uptake there's 11 papers

644
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:57,980
showing the benefits for Glomus masky

645
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:00,799
some interactions and and and well

646
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,230
communicate them so that's just

647
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,109
important and an interesting to see the

648
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:10,250
different species provide different

649
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:16,869
functional benefits and this is just one

650
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:20,170
slide from one graph from a paper where

651
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:23,869
they evaluated two natural habitats of

652
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,900
natural habitats of two species so you

653
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:29,629
can see two bars here and the community

654
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,190
composition over time from July the

655
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,650
following in June and what you can see

656
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,840
here is the different colors show

657
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,960
different genotype for different speed

658
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,449
we can call it different species of my

659
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,650
crazy and and you can see that the color

660
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:47,120
the colors change within the season so

661
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:51,650
that's important that there is a change

662
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:55,039
in diversity of micro so species with

663
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:57,519
the plant so they you know in the winter

664
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,680
and in the summer there are a different

665
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:05,629
composition of this like size of

666
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:09,079
community and this is just one photo

667
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,690
where there's a comparison with a single

668
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,110
species and and the multiple species you

669
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:22,240
can see that difference in in growth and

670
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:24,649
this is a grass in case of the grass

671
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,959
inoculum in micro Sol products so we

672
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:30,589
call them proper use and there are two

673
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,990
main types of propagules colonize root

674
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,559
fragments that contain spores and and

675
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:39,859
and high tea and other micro structures

676
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,349
and they normally faster in establishing

677
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,980
the relationship to colonize that the

678
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:48,110
plant roots and also fungal spores so

679
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,378
spores are not only in a dormant stage

680
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,970
and germinate a little bit slower than

681
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:58,219
than these root fragments so these are

682
00:34:52,969 --> 00:35:01,239
the two main types of propagules in

683
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:07,789
commercial products

684
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:10,549
and last but not least a couple slides

685
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:13,088
on the ways of application how my cries

686
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:17,300
my cries aw inoculum could be applied so

687
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:22,070
in in horticulture they could be applied

688
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,930
by just spreading ores in the in the

689
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:29,150
planting hole so this is a very

690
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:30,919
efficient way of inoculating the plants

691
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,858
because it provides a direct contact

692
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,170
with the roots so when the plants are

693
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:37,880
planted in this hole here gonna be in

694
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,358
direct contact with the roots and that's

695
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,579
very important it could be incorporated

696
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,769
in the growing media before or at

697
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:49,130
planting and mostly granular or powder

698
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:51,650
product should come into account but the

699
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,599
most important thing is that that you

700
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,510
have to provide a very good blending or

701
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,050
mixing with with the growth medium

702
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:02,690
because what happens is these tiny cells

703
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,359
where where the plants or the seeds are

704
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,730
gonna be seated they are gonna contain

705
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,480
only two or three propagules on average

706
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,829
so that's really really hard to achieve

707
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,929
under commercial conditions to have a

708
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:21,460
very very uniform glancing through

709
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:24,919
dipping this is particularly with with

710
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:28,420
perennial crops like grapes or apple

711
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,950
trees for example before planting so

712
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,130
growers can just mix up a bucket of

713
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:38,029
water with some micro inoculum and dip

714
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:40,940
it in in this plants into this solution

715
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:44,930
and this is how they provide the direct

716
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,700
contact before planting and the only

717
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:49,039
thing that you have to be aware is that

718
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:52,068
the the proper you stance tends to

719
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,289
settle in the bottom of the bucket so

720
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:58,519
you just have to shake it or we're

721
00:36:54,289 --> 00:37:01,400
mixing with the water the same thing

722
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:07,150
could be done by a backpack sprayer just

723
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,150
spraying directly on the under root

724
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,670
Micra inoculum could be applied through

725
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:17,000
irrigation could be overhead or or drip

726
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:22,610
irrigation depends on the crop and the

727
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,610
best is is to water before before

728
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:27,980
application to wet the soil profile and

729
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,539
the Micra is a just please micros or

730
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,110
proper use are normally pretty small

731
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:35,090
less than 300 sometimes 200 microns so

732
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,579
they easily travel through the soil the

733
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:43,400
wet soil profile so they can get into

734
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:45,409
that into the root zone and see

735
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,639
treatment some some products already

736
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:52,609
contain my crazy on their seed coat so

737
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:54,829
right after germination in the soil the

738
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:58,130
micros is there the microns of fungus is

739
00:37:54,829 --> 00:38:03,199
there to form the symbiosis with these

740
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:05,930
germinating seeds and powder products

741
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:10,279
can be very popular or in some cases

742
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:13,039
when like alfalfa they mix the seeds

743
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,990
with granular products because the size

744
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,519
of the seed is the same as the granular

745
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:25,669
size so they can just spread or sprinkle

746
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:47,809
together and I think that's what I had

747
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:50,090
for today that's where we see the most

748
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:52,940
benefits yes when the conditions are

749
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,140
optimal let's say an optimum irrigation

750
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,150
or fertilization

751
00:38:54,139 --> 00:39:00,529
you know the plants won't really need

752
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:05,349
too much help to absorb more nutrients

753
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,350
or water so we see most most benefits

754
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,559
yes yes there are different formulations

755
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:26,500
yet that contains four five

756
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:28,139
nine species guess have you any

757
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:33,329
questions

758
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:37,299
Geneva campus do you have any questions

759
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:40,829
so if you're dealing with a an apple

760
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:44,230
tree coming bare root from a nursery man

761
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:46,719
isn't quite good to just have the

762
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,579
nursery man inoculate the roots or it's

763
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,809
much better to wait until they are just

764
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:54,909
going into the ground as as early as

765
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:58,779
possible so if they can apply it at the

766
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:00,819
nursery that's gonna be a much better

767
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,620
solution because by the time it is

768
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,600
transplanted into the field they can

769
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:08,819
provide the benefits and the symbiosis

770
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,819
has been already formed by the time

771
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,500
quick question about brassicas I've also

772
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:19,720
heard that there's you know scarcity of

773
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,070
symbiotic relationships has are you

774
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:23,549
aware of any studies where they've

775
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,830
tested older germ plasm or

776
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:33,010
even sort of the wild progenitors for

777
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:33,579
symbiotic relationships in what plant

778
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:39,480
species

779
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:45,309
Brassica a Brassica no no I am not aware

780
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:50,230
thank you although I call reading a

781
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:54,039
paper about a Brassica that that they

782
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:57,190
found a very mild colonization at their

783
00:40:54,039 --> 00:41:01,980
later stage of their life just before

784
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:06,880
senescence which was very interesting

785
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:15,820
but I don't really remember any any germ

786
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:19,110
plasm tests or thank you Michael Ryan's

787
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:26,050
a first identified and when was their

788
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:33,940
first well I think it was the late 1800s

789
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:38,339
when they named mycorrhizae and in the

790
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:41,230
I would say in the 30s or 40s 1900s

791
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,119
1930s or 40s when they started to

792
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,719
recognize because earlier they thought

793
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,869
that they actually have a negative

794
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,929
effect on on the plans and they didn't

795
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:58,358
really look at look at a growth response

796
00:41:52,929 --> 00:42:00,578
and what happened is well they certainly

797
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:03,130
didn't look at nutrient uptake and

798
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:08,829
nutrient content of the of the leaves

799
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:14,289
but in the 40s when they started to

800
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:19,260
recognize the benefits I'm curious about

801
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:23,259
the shelf life of these organisms and

802
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:27,240
packaged potting mix because some of the

803
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:29,829
artificial makes formulators or

804
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:33,338
incorporating various kinds of micro

805
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:36,970
easy and how long those mycorrhizae stay

806
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:42,549
active you know you know prepared

807
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:45,129
fighting that's before it gets well dry

808
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,068
and granular formulations have a three

809
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,470
and a five this is required from state

810
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:52,690
regulators however when it's mixed in

811
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:54,159
with with the soil

812
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,318
everything depends on the moisture

813
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,299
content of the soil so if it's a low

814
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,789
moisture content it's gonna have a

815
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,190
longer shelf life let's say one year or

816
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:07,239
up to two years however it has a if it

817
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,880
has a high moisture content over 40%

818
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:12,399
that could reduce the shelf life

819
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:20,019
significantly to even six months or one

820
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:36,039
year it depends on the components yes

821
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:39,869
the storage conditions for you what am i

822
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:39,869
quart of my Crosley inoculant industry

823
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,599
what I think is is

824
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:52,299
probably the high number of companies

825
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,339
that are popping up right now because

826
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,789
it's really easy so I didn't talk about

827
00:43:54,338 --> 00:44:00,489
the production of mycorrhizae so there

828
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:02,259
is in vitro and in vivo production in

829
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:05,588
vitro is in that happens in the lab in

830
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,349
vivo is out the field and in vivo

831
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:13,449
production is really relatively easy to

832
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:15,910
do and smaller companies and to start

833
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:19,449
because it's start to grow mycorrhizae

834
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:23,828
on their own and without any any quality

835
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:28,088
control any field trial testing they

836
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:30,039
they market their product and they they

837
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:32,108
put everything on the label that has

838
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,108
been published for different species of

839
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:38,650
my crazy so what happens is that reduced

840
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:44,289
it reduces the credibility of of the

841
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:46,420
larger producers and because you know

842
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:48,039
it's just really hard to control and I

843
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:52,599
and I see that's the most important

844
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:56,380
problem to to to stay credible and and

845
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,970
just put you know those claims on the

846
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,190
label that you have been tested because

847
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:04,328
also the companies don't really have a

848
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:08,108
budget to execute a large-scale field

849
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:13,599
trial program to to test it in corn to

850
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:16,049
test it in in various species and that

851
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,420
creates some kind of attention because

852
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:21,550
you know there are hundreds of products

853
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,068
out there but growers just don't know

854
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,950
which one to choose because the

855
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:30,099
information is just not out there so I I

856
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:38,710
see that that's a that's a main issue

857
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:41,890
right now my crazy attitude grubbing

858
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:45,159
mixes or the garden center bags

859
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:48,818
mycorrhizae how you know that it'll work

860
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:51,818
for what you want to be growing or is it

861
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:53,289
wasted on maybe these species don't work

862
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:57,338
for tomato

863
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:58,480
trees yes actually that's that's another

864
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:02,139
main

865
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,769
that I have convention because you know

866
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:09,400
some companies just put a lot of things

867
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:11,469
in in potting mixes for example both

868
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,470
ecto mycorrhizae and endo mycorrhizae

869
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:21,250
and certainly you know the potting mix

870
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:23,108
that is labeled for vegetable use you

871
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,670
know there's ecto mycorrhizae in it you

872
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:26,769
just pay for extra my crazy it's never

873
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:33,720
gonna do anything or any harm any good

874
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:36,280
and that's that's a problem I see that

875
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:39,000
that there are several products out

876
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:42,510
there that that are marketed for

877
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,530
specific uses but not the right

878
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,320
components are there another right

879
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,150
species for example there are products

880
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,350
out there for ericaceous particularly

881
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:55,769
aggregations plants blueberries and

882
00:46:52,349 --> 00:47:00,069
there's just ecto micro I see in it and

883
00:46:55,769 --> 00:47:03,429
it just won't help so that's that's it's

884
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:07,800
kind of a problem didn't answer your

885
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:10,989
question I'm sorry oh how do you find

886
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,000
well I think it's it's best to call the

887
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:15,819
manufacturer and and get the information

888
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,670
directly from them because you know if

889
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,690
there's a credible company so they

890
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,950
should have a technical support

891
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,050
[Music]

892
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:27,730
department where they can provide you

893
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,530
know all this information or you can

894
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,809
certainly look it up online on the

895
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:34,510
internet and find papers but the easiest

896
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:37,420
is just to talk to them directly and and

897
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:41,770
get the information firsthand from them

898
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,720
so but I do want to again remind France

899
00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:47,800
which students if you'd like to continue

900
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:52,149
the dialogue with dr. Ochs both will be

901
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:56,700
in room 22 plant science starting in 10

902
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,700
minutes or less thank you so much

903
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:05,949
this has been a production of Cornell

904
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,950
University on the web at Cornell edu
