1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
University

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,558
I wanted to thank you to thank my

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,419
students and this is what our group

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,618
meetings look like on the left side of

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,519
the screen

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:23,759
it was either cubby halls or meeting in

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,820
Central Park when the situation seems to

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,640
alleviate

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,980
before the next variant showed up

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,780
but also I particularly I wanted to

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,799
highlight

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,020
um the the individuals here who

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,519
contributed

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,980
through the research

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,980
Kimberly Gibson Sarah dolli

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,719
uh and then Stephanie Zulo are students

18
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,479
of mine

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,780
they are now off to better things they

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,519
have graduated

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,640
Medina is a student of

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,478
Gilbert and uh physiology

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,640
and Santos Barrera who also contributed

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,359
a few of the slides

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,000
was a long time

26
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,340
researcher at seat and he then recently

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,400
obtained PhD at the University of

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,060
Nebraska you know collaboration

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,060
so

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,020
so

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,420
I will

32
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,679
this is kind of a brief overview of my

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,579
program

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,580
skip that

35
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,179
I would like to outline

36
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,319
my talk is that and uh

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,460
it's well timed because the iccp

38
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:52,438
or ipcc came with that latest report and

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,578
it's as

40
00:01:52,438 --> 00:02:00,978
uh troublesome as ever

41
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,978
and we don't seem to be doing anymore

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,159
so I

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,479
would like to talk about a briefly

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,380
introduce the topic they need to

45
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,439
increase

46
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,419
and speed up John plasma utilization

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,159
another

48
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:19,859
I think that a lot of people are doing

49
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:22,098
this but the target seems to be

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,560
ever more complex

51
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:27,419
I'll introduce then the model I'm

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,439
talking about this is inspired by

53
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:34,679
research on domestication hotspot phase

54
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,800
always with our seven domestications

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,200
I'll explain this to you and then two of

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,700
these domesticates are temporary bean

57
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,598
and lima beans

58
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,919
and they may help us in this dire

59
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,439
situation

60
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,439
and then I'll end with a summary

61
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,238
so it's clear that you know we have been

62
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,399
putting out CO2 and other greenhouse

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,180
gases

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,640
um

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,840
not slowing at a rate that is not

66
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,619
slowing down

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,878
if you see this in the left part

68
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,980
um

69
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:14,699
but also

70
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,679
um

71
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,780
we have benefited

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,719
and this is the domestication work that

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,840
shows from a relatively stable climate

74
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,300
for the last 10 000 years

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,878
and except then what you're right at the

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,410
end you see a an ever increasing

77
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,878
temperature

78
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,359
[Music]

79
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:40,018
and we have to deal with that

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,440
the issue will not go away even if we

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,219
were to stop right now all the CO2

82
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,459
emissions and other greenhouse gases

83
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,519
because you see the difference here

84
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,519
I think I also talked to zoom

85
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,219
the the two curves here this is the

86
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,439
emissions if we take the best case

87
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,598
scenario where we stop all the uh

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,459
emissions as fast as possible the light

89
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,060
blue line here

90
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,280
the CO2 content of the atmosphere is

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,680
barely going to decrease

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,639
so we are set with a continued

93
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,160
continually he

94
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,160
heated uh climate all over the Earth

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,079
and we see the consequences also for a

96
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,198
long time people have said well where is

97
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,939
this uh global climate change

98
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,560
and as recently I think there was an

99
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,879
article in the New York Times that

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,600
questioned that

101
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,060
to stay out of U.S politics the French

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,800
president said you have never told us

103
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,220
that we were going to be faced with

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,460
these catastrophes and so on upon which

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,300
the French media put together a clip

106
00:04:53,459 --> 00:05:01,198
where they they listed almost several

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,660
instances dating back to the 1970s where

108
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,120
they said hey we are going to we are

109
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,600
faced with global climate change and

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,918
certainly Global media okay

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
um

112
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,019
so

113
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,120
to give a recent example here

114
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:23,038
at the left this is what the situation

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,560
in California in September of last year

116
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,219
not very long ago

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,560
this is the situation now in March

118
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,660
and we see a radical change in terms of

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,478
the drought status

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,300
I would say a drought improve

121
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,758
Improvement of the drought status in the

122
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,460
state and it's not finished

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,100
they are expecting another atmospheric

124
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,719
River this this week and it's going to

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,039
affect mostly Central and Southern

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,120
California

127
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,519
okay we can say that this is a

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,060
consequence of global warming

129
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:04,620
of the the oceans

130
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:08,459
so how do we deal with this Heating and

131
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,459
this irregular precipitation

132
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,919
we are going to be faced with drought

133
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,560
and just to simplify because it's going

134
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,620
to come back later on there are at least

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,180
two types major types of graduated the

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,060
one in the middle intermittent drought

137
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,918
where you have irregular rainfall and so

138
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,800
the crops have to be faced with

139
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,620
sufficient water insufficient water in

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,780
succession and then at the bottom you

141
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,360
see the terminal drought where the crop

142
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,659
is grown as a consequence or based on

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,759
the residual moisture in the soil and so

144
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,580
when we talk about drought we have to at

145
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,100
least Define these two big classes of

146
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,959
drought and I will talk mostly about the

147
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,680
2D intermittent throughout the internal

148
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,019
drugs for that but this is from a work

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,319
by Fisher who was talking about rice

150
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:08,159
okay so this is an issue that goes

151
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,479
across or crops also

152
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,539
yeah

153
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:15,538
now the second theme is that

154
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,719
we have these Gene Banks they have been

155
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:22,079
established all over the world USDA has

156
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,180
an important germplasm system I would

157
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,579
say that it's probably

158
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,220
the biggest and if not the most

159
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:32,399
successful one

160
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,720
but one limitation is

161
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:40,098
the the use of it the lack of thereof

162
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,900
and also the speed at which we use these

163
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:45,478
accessions in a gene Bank

164
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:48,659
and so

165
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,360
I will focus primarily here

166
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,819
on this aspect here The Germ plasm how

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,300
do we get it into the current breeding

168
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,300
Cycles

169
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,840
now

170
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:06,359
I've been working on physiologists for

171
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,918
quite some time starting at the gene

172
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:15,060
bank at a gene Bank in Seattle Colombia

173
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:18,779
and the predictions here is you see here

174
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,839
this is a work of Ramirez caral and it

175
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,878
shows the optimum versus less Optimum

176
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,519
areas

177
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,479
in principally I would say here in South

178
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:32,759
America and in Africa and I highlight

179
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,338
these regions because they are so

180
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,599
important in the nutrition

181
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,520
oh

182
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,459
um local people

183
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,338
if they people haven't eaten beans they

184
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:46,919
probably think they haven't eaten at all

185
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,320
and its beans and rice beans and Maize

186
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,838
and so on

187
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,200
now if we look at the predictions for

188
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,200
the future

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,720
in the Americas and in Africa you see

190
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,360
that this suitable area which is the

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,399
green area is shrinking

192
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,639
with the current materials and in the

193
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,240
current way of growing these crops

194
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:16,199
so to this is an incentive actually to

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:20,580
look what can we do when faced with this

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,800
hit the increased heat and also the

197
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,339
irregularity of the precipitation

198
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,338
right

199
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,480
so the genus physiologist itself

200
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,338
has five domesticated species they have

201
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,320
been known for some time

202
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,640
you have common being which is by far

203
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,640
the most important one

204
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:49,100
you have Runner Bean which is the

205
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,099
closest or close relative

206
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:54,000
you have the so-called year being which

207
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:57,958
is the least known of the five

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,820
domesticates uh predominantly in Central

209
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,219
America

210
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,339
but you also didn't have these two other

211
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,899
species temporary beam

212
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,640
and

213
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,039
lima bean

214
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,080
what we have found is that

215
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,219
two of those species have been

216
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,220
domesticated twice

217
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,959
in Mexico and in the southern Andes

218
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:27,778
and lima bean again in Mexico

219
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:30,179
and in the Andes but in a very

220
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:33,720
restricted area on the western slope of

221
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:36,859
the Andes in Ecuador in Northern Peru

222
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,778
and interestingly that area also has

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,339
these wild common being but those were

224
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,559
not domesticated and there is an

225
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,560
altitude difference Lima beanies on the

226
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,778
lower altitudes and common Bean is at a

227
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,119
higher altitude and so it's almost like

228
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:53,519
people made a choice

229
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,078
and they domesticated lima bean rather

230
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,000
than common B

231
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,000
in that area

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,240
now our differences why is it that

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
people

234
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,078
domesticated these different species

235
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:10,379
what you see on the screen is the

236
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,838
distribution of the wild ancestor

237
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,838
from the left you see common B that has

238
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,040
the broadest distribution

239
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:23,940
uh lima bean is close also it involves

240
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:27,059
this migration in both species from the

241
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,160
area of origin of the genus

242
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:32,159
to Central America and then most

243
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:35,039
importantly to the Andes and there are

244
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,519
several breakpoints that are naturally

245
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,039
determined lima bean has pretty much the

246
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,720
same distribution but it's a in terms of

247
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,679
genetic relatedness it's somewhat

248
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,879
different then you have Runner being

249
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,859
you have the stepory beam which is

250
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,799
concentrated in you could say the

251
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,659
Northwest quadrants of Mexico and also

252
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,019
the southwest of the U.S principally

253
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:03,059
Arizona and then the year being has a

254
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,360
very narrow distribution the wild

255
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,578
ancestor in Guatemala and this is

256
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,039
probably caused to because of the fact

257
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:14,159
that it's a hybrid state stabilized

258
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,000
hybrid between Runner bean and commonly

259
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,000
okay

260
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,959
so these are the three Gene pools in

261
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,940
common Bean and the red one and the blue

262
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,359
one have been domesticated to not the

263
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,360
yellow one

264
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:34,620
so these are again the seven

265
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,019
domestications you see at the top row is

266
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,879
the wild relative very small seeds

267
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,959
camouflaged

268
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,820
uh and then the the next row are the

269
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,759
domesticated seeds and you see a

270
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,740
tremendous change in size and color and

271
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,740
so on

272
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,620
now another thing that differentiates

273
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,440
them is their adaptation

274
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,500
the most important species here Human

275
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,820
Bean and I say economically at this

276
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,578
stage is uh growing in an intermediate

277
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,100
environment not too hot not too cold not

278
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,799
too dry not too wet

279
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,959
on the left of it are the species that

280
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,719
are adapted to a cooler more humid

281
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,278
environment

282
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,160
which on the face of it might not be

283
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,740
useful in a

284
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,620
in a scenario of

285
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,820
global climate change but who knows

286
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,000
if we want to plant earlier to adapt

287
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,100
be spacious to

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,620
global warming maybe we'll have to plant

289
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,980
earlier into a cooler season so this is

290
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,220
not that they are not useful but for now

291
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,200
we don't concentrate on them on the

292
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,620
right you have lima bean and temporary

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,420
bean and they are adapted to drier

294
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,578
and other climates

295
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,759
it's definitely the case for temporary

296
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:05,338
Bean for Lima Bean this is a species

297
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,059
with a very with the broadest adaptation

298
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,060
in Mexico

299
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,060
another aspect that we have

300
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:18,179
studied

301
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,739
is the domestication syndrome what are

302
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,958
the morphological differences and

303
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,620
physiological differences between

304
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:28,619
wild and domesticated types in common

305
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,679
being mainly and

306
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,139
I emphasize these traits because they

307
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,879
are still useful today this is not a

308
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,720
matter of the past ten thousand years

309
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,059
ago

310
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,879
they affect the product productivity and

311
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:44,578
the quality of these crops

312
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,360
even today

313
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,059
um

314
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,600
you have a number of characters here for

315
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,518
seeds and part colors and weight knowing

316
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,159
the color is extremely important in

317
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,339
terms of consumer acceptability

318
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,778
if it's not the right color people will

319
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,839
not accept it

320
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,620
and I'm not just talking about red or

321
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,220
yellow

322
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,278
no it's a particular shade of red

323
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,379
or a particular shade of yellow

324
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:17,639
so the consumer especially in the

325
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:20,278
Americas less so in Africa are extremely

326
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,740
how would I say uh

327
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,919
recognizing

328
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,539
picky if I could say about the the color

329
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,539
of these of these

330
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:38,338
the first actually character

331
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,219
domestication that we ident Gene for

332
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,260
domestication was the determinacy which

333
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,940
creates a bush beam

334
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,720
and

335
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,660
um

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,220
it is actually the gene responsible is a

337
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,219
homologue of arabidopsis

338
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,919
and it has three copies

339
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,899
in the genome in the bin genome and one

340
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,159
of them is where most of the mutations

341
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:10,980
the loss of function mutations for these

342
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:10,980
genes were identified it is also we took

343
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:17,100
took care of the opportunity in order to

344
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,458
demonstrate that he was really the gene

345
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:24,300
we transformed arabidopsis with a

346
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:26,879
functional allele of the the homolog in

347
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:30,059
beans actually and we were able to

348
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,679
restore the wild type phenotype in

349
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,578
arabidopsis

350
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:38,159
but so this Gene is important in the

351
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:41,819
bush production of green beans because

352
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:45,198
it's uh shortens the flowering time and

353
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,199
making Harvest easier

354
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:54,899
for the period sensitivity you will see

355
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,278
is tremendously important especially in

356
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:03,958
terms of John plasma utilization

357
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:07,078
is a semi-tropical Genus adapted to

358
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,399
um short days or long nights and when we

359
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,980
plant them

360
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,798
in temperate areas many of these

361
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,740
succession don't flower

362
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,679
so it affects utilization the screening

363
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,400
of John plasm as well and there are two

364
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,480
genes that have been identified

365
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,160
based on the materials that we had

366
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:34,220
distributed but by to Jim Weller in

367
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,220
Australia and Martha santaya in in Spain

368
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,460
see dormancy is also important and it

369
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,099
has to do with the permeability of the

370
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,740
seed coat and the composition in terms

371
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,319
of waxes

372
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,880
and then more recently

373
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:55,678
uh Travis Parker

374
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,960
was a student and now postdoc and now

375
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,740
researcher at Davis

376
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,279
um

377
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,440
studied the development of the pod in

378
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,558
during domestication so our first step

379
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,820
was to eliminate or reduce Cloud

380
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,279
shattering

381
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,200
again this is a trait that is still

382
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,759
important today

383
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,140
um and he also then studied the absence

384
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,919
of

385
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,500
threads or strings that people call we

386
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:30,059
talk about string bees so the modern

387
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:34,200
green beans don't have a string and this

388
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,178
he was able to figure out what the locus

389
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,640
is

390
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,679
it is again a homologue of arabidopsis

391
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,759
in the hissing Gene

392
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:48,360
at that Locus it is the the stringless

393
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,480
beings have a duplication

394
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,439
combined with an insertion of a

395
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,700
retrotransposon in between the two

396
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,058
copies

397
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,120
that creates an increased expression

398
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:02,399
and it eliminates the string

399
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,739
now at the same time this duplication

400
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,100
creates an instability

401
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,558
to an equal recombination you can revert

402
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:13,500
at a high frequency about one in a

403
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,899
thousand you can revert to these string

404
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,359
strings stringy state

405
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,880
and so we are still looking at what is

406
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,819
how can we deal with this to increase

407
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,280
the stability but it's a major issue in

408
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:30,839
terms of quality control and maintenance

409
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,519
of genetic stocks in the uh in in the

410
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,459
green bean industry the production of

411
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,980
oil varieties and they spend some kind

412
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,980
of fifty thousand dollars we don't know

413
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,579
for sure we're trying to guess

414
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,640
uh every year just because they have to

415
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:51,058
send down people through the fields to

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,179
Rogue the the revertence at the same

417
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:57,779
time these revertents are excellent

418
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,940
isogenic lines because you have the

419
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,759
original state and the reverton state in

420
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,519
the nisogeneous state yeah so we seek we

421
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,440
we are sequencing them as well but again

422
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,740
it illustrates how these domestication

423
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,860
traits are still important today

424
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,099
and one of the questions is what is the

425
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,959
equivalent of these genes the hopalog in

426
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,980
these other physiologist domesticated

427
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,980
species okay

428
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,220
so I have to introduce temporary Bean to

429
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,519
you and lima bean these are the

430
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,360
seedlings you see in the field to the

431
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,579
left

432
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,079
is uh

433
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,079
a temporary Bean seedling

434
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,759
you see here

435
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,759
and this is a lima bean season

436
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,099
um

437
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,700
this is what they look in the field at

438
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:59,038
the left you see common being at the

439
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,519
right is temporary beam it's a very

440
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,839
branched growth habit prostrate hugging

441
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,940
the soils

442
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,279
you think that it's part maybe of the

443
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,880
adaptation we see the same thing in

444
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,379
common being in the

445
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,140
ecogeographic ways Durango for northern

446
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,620
Mexico where it's dry they also have

447
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,960
this prostrate habit and also

448
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,379
interestingly in the anion domestication

449
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,900
raised Chile also has these prostate

450
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:31,039
growth habits because presumably because

451
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,038
of the dry environment

452
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,179
uh there is also a difference in the

453
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,400
earliness

454
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,340
to the left you see common Bean it's

455
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,960
still green the dry patches are these

456
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:49,079
mature cenest uh temporary beans

457
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,400
and then to the right here is Lima B so

458
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,538
there are differences in the average

459
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,419
cycle

460
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:57,240
clearly temperament is the shortest as

461
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,940
the shortest cycle which is part of that

462
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,359
tolerance to terminal drought

463
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,240
you have to run your cycle as quickly as

464
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,699
possible to escape the droughts at the

465
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,819
end of the cycle

466
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,480
this is what the seeds look like the

467
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:18,899
scale here is centimeters these are

468
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,179
photos of the gene bank at seat which

469
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,000
systematically takes photos of the seeds

470
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,740
and the PODS of their Holdings

471
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,919
and you see overall

472
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:33,620
the seeds are fairly small then that is

473
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,620
an issue with the consumers okay

474
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:46,678
and our Gene Banks you have the USDA as

475
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,419
Holdings seat Hillary in Africa as a

476
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,460
potential forage

477
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:54,720
and you see that

478
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:00,259
branched growth habits here

479
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,259
but also Australia in Brazil

480
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,620
most of the wild types the orange dots

481
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,200
they're distributed like I said in the

482
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:14,699
Northwest Quadrant of Mexico but also

483
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:18,538
spilling over into Arizona and then the

484
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,279
domesticated types in purple have a

485
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,859
slightly broader distribution but not

486
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,019
that Broad and then there are

487
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:29,599
differences among the wild populations

488
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:33,119
in terms of their adaptation to Drought

489
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,158
you have types here near at the stream

490
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,339
edges

491
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:42,120
but then going up the slope and their

492
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:44,939
leaves also change

493
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,759
um the ones that are up to slopes are in

494
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,340
dry conditions and they have smaller

495
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,339
leaves or smaller evaporative surface

496
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:59,220
so this was a collaborative trial with

497
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:02,339
seat uh

498
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,000
and Nebraska Carlos

499
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,678
udea who is the bean breeder in the

500
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,119
Panhandle in western Nebraska

501
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,000
and

502
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:16,199
myself and Jorge Bernie is a student

503
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,619
here in Davis and Santos Barrera he's

504
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:24,058
the person from seat who was kind of

505
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,719
central to these comparative

506
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,720
um

507
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
experiments

508
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,840
and then heat stress trials here were

509
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:39,059
conducted then both in California the

510
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,119
university has these really

511
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:45,119
unappreciated series of experiment

512
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,459
station kind of north south along the

513
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,339
state and they have very diverse

514
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,500
environment and one here is that the

515
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,439
so-called desert research and Extension

516
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Center with the board of Mexico

517
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,240
in the summer it's

518
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,240
to quote stinking hot

519
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,558
and that's what we want

520
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:09,538
and we had done a preliminary experiment

521
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:13,319
growing common Bean lima bean and

522
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:15,599
temporary Bean common being was killed

523
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,178
and the only the two species that

524
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,939
survived were lima bean and temporary

525
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,200
beam okay so we had done a preliminary

526
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,519
experiment

527
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,659
but then they also conducted experiments

528
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,379
um

529
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:34,620
in um in Colombia you know the northern

530
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:38,340
coast near the Caribbean uh very hot and

531
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:42,778
humid this time uh and then Alvarado in

532
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:47,359
one of the The Valleys of the Magdalena

533
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:50,400
river which can also be very hot

534
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,079
the results of this analysis then if you

535
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,380
compare

536
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:58,500
UC Davis and another station West

537
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,500
the West Side research and Extension

538
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,240
Center the three species here commonly

539
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,038
in temporary being the non-babina color

540
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,480
products so you see the green ones are

541
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:13,019
common beans

542
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,599
and this graph then shows uh well

543
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,480
irrigated and drought and you see a

544
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:22,319
fairly good correlation but

545
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,720
common being is the least adapted

546
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,418
to this situation

547
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,019
then comes the lima bean in red

548
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:34,140
and then in blue is separating

549
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,740
and clearly there are tremendous marked

550
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,480
species differences as well as

551
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,019
intra-specific differences in their

552
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,339
yields

553
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:49,500
I will highlight here the step varieties

554
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:52,019
these are actually bread lines these are

555
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,140
not just giant plasm land races

556
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:58,558
and tap is actually a product

557
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:01,440
led by Tim Porsche

558
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:06,538
some of you may know Tim porch he's a

559
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,960
graduate of Cornell Okay so

560
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:14,278
it shows on one hand that yes we can use

561
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:17,759
the land races but breeding will add to

562
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:20,400
the the tolerance of the distributions

563
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,940
there has been almost no breeding in

564
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,940
that species

565
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,860
met stands for multi-environment trials

566
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:37,798
and you see here an analysis just of

567
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,959
temporary being under heat stress and

568
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,538
under drought stress and the two

569
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,778
combined fairly High correlation but

570
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:50,038
again these tap materials come out on

571
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:55,079
top here so there is room for breeding

572
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,079
um in in this species

573
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,919
and the same thing here where you look

574
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,759
at the yield which the Improvement

575
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,320
improved lines figure here as the

576
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,419
highest

577
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,418
highest yielders in this situation

578
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:17,339
now one of the things that is

579
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,259
interesting here is that you know at

580
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:21,839
each of these locations we grow them

581
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:25,619
underground in the well water conditions

582
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,720
and you might ask well do these how do

583
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,599
they group these locations and these

584
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,259
treatments you could say well all the

585
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:37,139
drought stressed materials will group on

586
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,158
one side and the well watered on the

587
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,620
other side

588
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,100
or is it going to be grouped according

589
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:46,739
to location and what turns out is that a

590
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:50,038
group rather based on location rather

591
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,778
than treated within location

592
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:56,339
to me it suggests that we don't

593
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:59,759
completely know what is adaptation

594
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:02,339
we treat them here in terms of broadly

595
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,038
speaking the general temperature the

596
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,500
general rainfall or the the amount of

597
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,879
water supplied during the experiment but

598
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,000
that is not enough

599
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,539
there must be other characters involved

600
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,599
in adaptation besides these few simple

601
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:20,839
ones here I don't have an answer to that

602
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,058
question what is it that really

603
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:28,918
differentiates these locations what you

604
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:31,500
see here is this is UC Davis

605
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,360
this is Alvarado in Colombia high

606
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,058
temperature

607
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,500
this is Palmira also in Colombia drought

608
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:40,440
and irrigated

609
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,058
okay so you see here the pattern that

610
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,700
the different treatments tend to group

611
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:47,000
together it's really separated by

612
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,000
location

613
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:54,778
it's not a new observation really but it

614
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,460
it raises that question of

615
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,460
we need to know more about it

616
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,260
now

617
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,019
temporary Bean has been of interest to

618
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:13,380
people in common being because they see

619
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:17,778
it as a source of genetic diversity and

620
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,778
particularly resistance to Common being

621
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,220
resistant to common bacterial blood in

622
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,558
common being

623
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,500
and that has been transferred to show

624
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:32,099
you and people have developed over about

625
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,140
I would say 20 25 years from near

626
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:37,439
absence of resistance in common being

627
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,659
two fairly high levels of resistance by

628
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,058
combining different sources including

629
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:44,360
the resistance in equity folios in

630
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:44,359
temporary

631
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:51,658
and the the intention is then to combine

632
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,759
this also with tolerance to heat and

633
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:58,200
tolerance to gratitude

634
00:30:53,759 --> 00:31:01,859
whether that's going to be possible is

635
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,100
depends I think the common B the common

636
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:07,558
bacterial blight resistance was in

637
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:10,199
essence an easy case

638
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,778
it's a major Gene trait in temporary

639
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,360
beam although it's more complex in

640
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:19,380
common being but it was a they were able

641
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,240
to do it using acrobatics which I will

642
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,460
explain

643
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,819
drought tolerance we almost showed that

644
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,140
it's a genetically more complex traits

645
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:28,918
now but the point I would like to make

646
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,840
here

647
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,520
the emphasis is always transferring

648
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,459
generic diversity from temporary B to

649
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,278
Common B but what about the opposite

650
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:42,120
let's take this adaptation

651
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:46,220
to heat and drought in temporary bead

652
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:48,178
and build February beam as another crop

653
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,000
and

654
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,860
I think people start turning around with

655
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,140
that but the emphasis has always still

656
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:58,439
been improved in common

657
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,179
my points in this talk is yes we should

658
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,058
be able to do both

659
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,059
and even if the situation

660
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:09,298
persists really improves Library being

661
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:11,839
as a source as a brain building

662
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:11,839
so

663
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,219
pepper we've been here

664
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,099
is a domesticate that has domesticated

665
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,319
things wild types it can be trusted with

666
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:25,500
extreme difficulty

667
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,158
okay and people have to use

668
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,398
embryo culture and so on

669
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,100
the natives actually cannot be crossed

670
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,459
to vulgaris and the other species that

671
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:41,219
has been determined

672
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,720
so this is I would say gene24

673
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,058
um

674
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,700
well temporary Bean is gene pool three

675
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:50,339
but the reciprocally between common

676
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,558
being and B so that's an issue to take

677
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,599
into account

678
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,898
um

679
00:32:53,599 --> 00:33:01,259
we have done whole genome sequences

680
00:32:56,898 --> 00:33:04,158
sequencing of uh land races breeding

681
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:06,960
materials in common being

682
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,760
including these genetic stocks that are

683
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,319
resistant

684
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:16,759
what you see here the organization of

685
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,759
genetic diversity so you have

686
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,419
the 11 chromosomes from 1 to 11.

687
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:28,080
the blue

688
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:30,720
so the blue color represents an anion

689
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,158
origin after the chromosome the part of

690
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,819
the chromosome

691
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,980
and so these block of lines here from A

692
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:42,658
and D to

693
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,819
nabe nabe 14 these are typically Andean

694
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,240
domesticates

695
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:50,460
on the other hand the red or pink lines

696
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,720
from ALB

697
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,980
to vac 6 are typically Mesoamerican

698
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,778
domesticates

699
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,079
and you see that there is some

700
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:03,240
introgression maybe asymmetric if you

701
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,398
have more integration for mesoamerica to

702
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,039
the Andy and group and that is because

703
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,539
of reading one wanted to introduce

704
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:10,800
disease resistance

705
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:13,940
okay

706
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,320
nevertheless we see a few other

707
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,019
inter-specific introgressions and the

708
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,599
one from temporary Bean here is

709
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:23,599
typically at the end of chromosomes

710
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,399
I don't know exactly why but we have

711
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:33,918
noticed that disease resistance clusters

712
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,918
are usually at the end of chromosomes

713
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,039
and that may be because there is higher

714
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
recombination there

715
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,519
and the recombination creates genetic

716
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,139
diverse

717
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,280
uh

718
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,440
faced which could face the variability

719
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,500
of the pathogen

720
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,720
but it's also maybe easier to introgress

721
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,480
a material in a high recombination

722
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,559
region than in a low recombination

723
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,858
region

724
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,619
that clearly is a caveat in terms of the

725
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:05,880
future in terms of introdressing these

726
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,180
different traits

727
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,960
okay so it says we need to have larger

728
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:15,500
populations maybe to identify rare

729
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,500
recombinants

730
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,480
so the contribution here of

731
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,400
Santos

732
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,380
who although he got his degree at

733
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:36,358
Nebraska he came two summers to Davis to

734
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:37,559
help to also screen these materials

735
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:39,179
um

736
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,799
what he did

737
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:44,399
was

738
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,039
to cross an inter-specific inbred line

739
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,338
the I and b834

740
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,079
with a wild relative of tapiribi the

741
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:53,519
parvifolius

742
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,519
which is

743
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:00,059
been relabeled recently but it's let's

744
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,800
say Harvey polius so you have vulgaris

745
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:04,799
acotifolius

746
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,900
and Harvey folias so they call this the

747
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,560
VAP lines

748
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,559
and

749
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,059
give you the

750
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,500
comparison if you cross vulgaris bike

751
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:22,199
with portfolios you have to make tons of

752
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,579
crosses you see the

753
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:28,559
the labels to the left here of the

754
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,320
failed crosses

755
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,858
if on the other hand you cross this line

756
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,859
to part of the folders you have a

757
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:41,699
relatively High success rate and this is

758
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:41,699
just a visual comparison

759
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:49,078
but you get then

760
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:52,159
seeds that will develop

761
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:55,920
for a normal vulgaris by temporary being

762
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,838
across you have to do an Embryo Embryo

763
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,820
culture to retrieve anything at all

764
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,759
right

765
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:06,539
so it is easier to cross

766
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,800
this vulgaris containing hybrid in red

767
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:12,420
line with Harvey folios

768
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,240
and you see them here the developing

769
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,579
embryo

770
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:21,719
and you see a plantlet

771
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:25,019
and eventually fall plant here

772
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:27,899
now this line is still sterile but if

773
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,338
you back cross it to vulgaris you get a

774
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,700
progeny

775
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:35,099
so if you compare the normal

776
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,500
common B by teporin being crossed the

777
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,440
number of f1s that he obtained in spite

778
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,039
of the large number of

779
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,639
um

780
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,759
large number of crosses was maybe 20 and

781
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:51,299
compare comparison the cross of these

782
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,540
that lines by temporary Bean you could

783
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:58,160
you could obtain a large number 10-fold

784
00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:02,940
increase in the number of graduates

785
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:04,980
the number of PODS was also larger

786
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,700
um and

787
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,338
um

788
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:11,239
in spite of having a lower number of

789
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:11,239
pollinations

790
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,660
so

791
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,020
these VAP lines what they have allowed

792
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:21,480
us to do is to cross vulgaris

793
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,880
with temporary being at a much higher

794
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,240
rate than normal

795
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,300
basically initially Crossing vulgaria's

796
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,679
and aquatifolios was low viability low

797
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,859
fertility

798
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:39,559
so somewhere in that genome there must

799
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:42,480
be segments of horizontaliers that allow

800
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:44,159
increased success rate in the process we

801
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,199
don't know what the engineers are it's

802
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,199
an empirical observation right

803
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,180
these lines have been sequenced

804
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,719
you see here the reference genome which

805
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:02,358
is an engine reference genome you have

806
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,699
an aquatifolius

807
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:10,259
genome

808
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:13,379
this is a Mesoamerican genome and then

809
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:19,260
you have these VAP lines these Bridge

810
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:19,260
lines and inter-specific golgaris

811
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:26,118
and so they looked at the number of

812
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,838
Harvey folius

813
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,599
segments

814
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:33,838
that were transferred to the progeny in

815
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:39,180
in these VAP lines and you see a much

816
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:43,320
higher frequency here compared to

817
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:45,059
these inter-specific vulgaris values

818
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,980
and I

819
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,139
like to remind you these VAP lines are

820
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,838
also interspecific but they involve a

821
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:56,219
third species and so you have a higher

822
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:58,460
rate of transmission in these VAP lines

823
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:02,399
there is also

824
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:04,199
heterozygosity and that may be a problem

825
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
in maintenance

826
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,419
okay

827
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,838
so you see the comparison so this again

828
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:14,940
is the sequencing

829
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:17,719
the light blue is

830
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,720
common being

831
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,159
common being a genome

832
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:25,578
but then you have introgressions the

833
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:28,739
purple and the brown here from

834
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:30,680
aquitophobius and so large segments so

835
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:34,500
still there is an issue of recombination

836
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:37,440
but these VAP lines have an increased

837
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,780
introdression of equity folios or

838
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,480
parsifolius

839
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,320
um

840
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,320
segments in a chromosome

841
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,699
so Santos then wanted to test out

842
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,220
if it made any difference in terms of

843
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,098
drug tolerance

844
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:02,699
and so by Crossing

845
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,619
these VAP lines with that building as a

846
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:08,159
source of drought tolerance

847
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:11,280
you get a hybrid which you back cross

848
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,399
to equity folios this is what it looks

849
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,400
like

850
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,338
um then backwash it to vulgaris

851
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,260
another backrest

852
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,539
this is what it looks like and you see

853
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,099
the parts here there is no evidence

854
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:31,199
really

855
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,200
marked the evidence of sterility okay

856
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,099
So eventually he did then test the

857
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,140
progeny and you have these interspecific

858
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,380
lines that result from the cross between

859
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,838
VAP lines and acutifolios and then

860
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,680
controls you have the VAP lines

861
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:55,320
themselves you have common Bean lines

862
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:58,799
you have these inter-specific models by

863
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,800
temporary lines

864
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,260
I think I'm running out of time

865
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:09,358
yeah okay and uh so let me show you the

866
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,858
results of this

867
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,019
um

868
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:15,838
it then perform drought and heat

869
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:19,500
stressed trials

870
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:21,719
and what you see is that the progeny

871
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,320
lines you can identify these are in the

872
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:29,098
squares you see progeny lines

873
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,800
that are have better yields more

874
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:35,579
significantly higher yields under

875
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:41,820
drought uh in in two years actually

876
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:44,820
no so his interpretation is that we are

877
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,940
successful in transferring some of that

878
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:52,920
drought tolerance into lines of common

879
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,920
being that themselves are already high

880
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,039
more tolerant to drought and what the

881
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,500
fields you see here the comparison

882
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:04,639
between for example

883
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:08,039
the original fulgers

884
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:13,400
and this is the process involving this

885
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,400
three-way across with Barbie folios

886
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:19,800
I'll skip

887
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:22,380
a few our conclusion is from other

888
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,500
studies is that aquatifolius is for

889
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,740
terminal resistance uh terminal drought

890
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,880
and Lima beam is actually for

891
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,879
intermittent drought

892
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,200
I'll uh

893
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,119
we are also working on lima bean and

894
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,040
what you see here is we developed a

895
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,119
large-scale

896
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,980
um

897
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,920
a large-scale recombinant inbred

898
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,599
population that was useful in developing

899
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,659
a

900
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,838
developing a reference genome in Lima

901
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:59,719
Bean with Colombian researchers and then

902
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:04,338
mapping

903
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:04,338
several traits on the left

904
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,480
you have determinacy in the same

905
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:12,239
chromosome location as in common being

906
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,059
you have 100 seed weight which shows

907
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:18,000
additive pattern

908
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:20,940
flowering time also heavily determined

909
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,338
by determinacy and then cyanogenesis

910
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,338
which shows epistatic interaction

911
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,800
and the final thoughts here is that if

912
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,700
we want to increase the the use of Gene

913
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,359
Banks we have to be involved in

914
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:39,299
pre-breeding

915
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:42,059
like the experiments in crossability

916
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,000
uh but also

917
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:47,759
um the testing John plasm conversion

918
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
using these domestication traits to

919
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,040
introduce them into an adapted germ

920
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,260
plans which is kind of the opposite way

921
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,139
that we

922
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:01,160
and finally

923
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:01,159
I would

924
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:06,720
acknowledge these three people

925
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,000
because they are going to take over the

926
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:12,358
green breeding program the East Africa

927
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,179
program and also we have a group looking

928
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,179
at the physiology and the drought with

929
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:20,460
Matthew Gilbert and so I can retire

930
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,379
happily well I won't be retiring let me

931
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,440
tell you because I'll be working on that

932
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,838
lima bean project with the scri in the

933
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,920
USDA but at least some somewhat

934
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,920
alleviated and I'm very grateful for

935
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,559
these individuals for continuing to

936
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,818
listen but I'm sorry so I'm running a

937
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:44,279
little bit out thank you very much

938
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:48,199
and and of course you know Christine

939
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,200
that was the purpose of the slide

940
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:54,980
thank you I was wondering if your map

941
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,318
lines already showed some kind of

942
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,480
agronomically or agriculturally

943
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:02,759
improvements in terms of drought stress

944
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,719
or really just better possibility with

945
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,640
the temporary

946
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,639
I think that the fact that they have

947
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:10,078
viability fertility if they survive in

948
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,519
the field we think that it's a big

949
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,300
progress

950
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,039
but it's not the final detail

951
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,818
that's the pre-breeding that's

952
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,800
there have to be next steps

953
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,599
yeah

954
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,818
you have to realize what it was that's

955
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,920
why I showed that that's that slide with

956
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,699
all the labels and so on you know they

957
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,980
just

958
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:34,699
you try you try you find they fall off

959
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,699
and they fall off

960
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:40,618
so it having something that is viable

961
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:43,338
and fertile is already a big problem

962
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,338
yes

963
00:46:55,219 --> 00:47:01,318
there's one gene that is

964
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:04,380
every Variety in North America has to

965
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:07,199
have that is the hygiene or resist

966
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,720
immunity I think for resistance to give

967
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,118
common mosaic virus

968
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:15,358
it has reached a stage where people

969
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,640
cross Elite by Elite in common being in

970
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,818
North America well they don't even have

971
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:23,699
to screen for it because the two parents

972
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:26,818
have it and the progenies sociology

973
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:28,679
that definitely is the case then the

974
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:32,159
other might be some of the consumer

975
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:34,078
traits the seed size at least reach

976
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,118
something that is like a navy bean or a

977
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,700
black bean we have the colors already

978
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:42,599
but the seed size could be larger

979
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:46,980
and others yeah so that one we are

980
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:48,420
looking now at uh pot shattering we

981
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,519
don't think that it's a problem because

982
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,539
it comes from a dry area

983
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:54,119
but

984
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:55,559
we are looking at the the genetic basis

985
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,440
of

986
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:01,318
so I'm sure that once you start growing

987
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,000
the diseases and pests will find their

988
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,739
way to the field

989
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,358
then

990
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:08,358
then it's wide open

991
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:20,460
um even so far

992
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:23,098
is it very specifically

993
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,099
it's getting now over and narrow

994
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:28,019
so they are in competition with other

995
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:31,920
places in the country

996
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:34,619
so common being as disappeared

997
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,460
used to be but then it's competing with

998
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:41,099
North Dakota Michigan and so on

999
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,579
so it's now lima bean

1000
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:47,640
uh Black Eyed Pea Okapi and garbanzios

1001
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,780
and garbanzos get planted in the early

1002
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,239
winter

1003
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:54,180
as a winter crop because the others is

1004
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:56,578
seen as a summer crop but then in

1005
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:57,719
California they're also in competition

1006
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:00,960
with

1007
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,000
um these trees not trees

1008
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,420
and I don't understand that because

1009
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,420
these are going to be in water

1010
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,720
I expect them to start complaining that

1011
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,858
they don't get enough water

1012
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,078
why would you plant a tree but that's

1013
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:18,380
what they do so the the I think the

1014
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,200
economics is whatever

1015
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,579
yields or brings in most money per unit

1016
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,699
area

1017
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:30,240
that's the thing

1018
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:32,399
oh yes so you're saying that uh at the

1019
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:37,858
beginning Lima beam is more of a water

1020
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,780
user versus the uh temporary beans are a

1021
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,519
lot of paper yeah so could you highlight

1022
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,339
more on maybe

1023
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,259
the water user part of lima beans is

1024
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:49,139
there anything you've been able to learn

1025
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,760
from the water saver beads essentially

1026
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:52,379
trying is it just really just the

1027
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,819
growing season and that's why the

1028
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,119
difference of the length

1029
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:58,619
yeah actually in a sense everybody is

1030
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,900
not that different from common being

1031
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:04,800
except for the fact that it accelerates

1032
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,280
its growth under stress so it has this

1033
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,460
plasticity but you really if you used to

1034
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,500
work if you walk the fields say hey I've

1035
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:18,079
beaten up on this temporary beam and it

1036
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,079
grows faster and bigger yeah

1037
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,720
but lima bean but I think it's

1038
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:27,420
distinctive Treatise is that it has lots

1039
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,039
of biomass and including a very deep

1040
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,818
root system

1041
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:35,279
and so under heat stress the leaf

1042
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:37,980
temperature is lower than what you've

1043
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,000
seen come and Bean or even better

1044
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:45,358
think that it is because of evaporation

1045
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,420
uh that cools off the the mechanical

1046
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,219
and because of that deeper system

1047
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,800
and we have seen the same thing in Wild

1048
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:55,039
common being when we you can use wild

1049
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,220
common being to

1050
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:02,659
improve yield under stress these are the

1051
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:06,118
the populations that do that come from

1052
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:09,000
dry areas in Mexico the driest areas in

1053
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,619
Mexico they also have the deepest food

1054
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,019
system

1055
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,220
it's not a strong correlation but it's

1056
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:18,119
10 percent

1057
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:20,639
I'm satisfied with interesting because

1058
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,160
what is adaptation it's probably a

1059
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,259
multitude of Trades

1060
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:28,259
so there is not one trait that is

1061
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,260
incisive

1062
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:36,019
and so these wild beans they reshape

1063
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,460
their root system if you impose a stress

1064
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:38,940
equal amounts of

1065
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,940
[Music]

1066
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,940
um

1067
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:48,379
biomass they get deeper and less

1068
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,379
branched root systems

1069
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,000
what made you do you know the legume

1070
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,809
that has a really high level of three

1071
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,679
amino acids

1072
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:59,639
[Music]

1073
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,279
they have the highest they have the

1074
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:06,000
highest digestive dog essentially and

1075
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:09,200
two to three people more than approach

1076
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,199
I'm sorry

1077
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,220
I could maybe understand why they would

1078
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,579
have digestibility they don't have to

1079
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:20,338
cleave those proteins right yeah yeah

1080
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:24,559
but the question is they may also have

1081
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:24,558
three non-protein amino acids

1082
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,859
yeah you know there's lots of amino

1083
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,280
acids they're not necessarily the

1084
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:35,578
protein amino acid so are they really

1085
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,880
nutritional positive or negative factors

1086
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:40,260
right it seems like there are some amino

1087
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,818
acids that

1088
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,520
I don't know I

1089
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:47,519
I'm trying to go to the depths of my

1090
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:47,519
library

1091
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,760
I would be careful with that yeah

1092
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,858
I

1093
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:00,858
yeah I won't say anything

1094
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:28,440
what I meant to say is that the yield

1095
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,780
pattern among these standard set of

1096
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,200
lines is determined

1097
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,339
is grouped by location not by the

1098
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,578
treatment

1099
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:40,739
and a priority you could say well I'm

1100
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,480
going to have all the the drought

1101
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:44,879
treatments on one side and I'll do the

1102
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,480
well waters on the other side no it's

1103
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,220
actually said it's root by location

1104
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,260
and Nebraska seemed to be quite

1105
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:54,358
different we thought oh it's a fairly

1106
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,880
dry environment we're going to resemble

1107
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:59,519
California maybe no no it's very

1108
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,200
separate thing so there must be other

1109
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,420
factors

1110
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,000
involved

1111
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,460
and it's really asking the question to

1112
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,199
try to find an answer to draw the

1113
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,460
attention to people is that how do we

1114
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:13,460
characterize an environment

1115
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:21,599
this has been a production of Cornell
