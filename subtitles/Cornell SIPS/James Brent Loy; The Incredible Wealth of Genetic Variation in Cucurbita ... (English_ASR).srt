1
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,900
thank you very much and everyone hear me

2
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:15,198
I'm right very honored to be able to

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,030
come here and be able to interact with

4
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:18,559
some of the grad students we went out to

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,630
dinner and had a good time

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:28,788
I probably ordered the wrong stuff some

7
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:31,729
hot food but that was okay I actually

8
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:35,079
have a fair amount of connection with

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,009
Cornell people in the past I think

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,049
particularly those of you that are

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:42,289
graduate students ought to realize how

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:45,908
fortunate you are to be able to work at

13
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:49,789
an institution which has a lot of depths

14
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:55,280
in in the different areas of plant

15
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:58,269
biology and just the people that that

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,789
are your matters mentors they're

17
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:06,459
well-known people of the world and in my

18
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:09,620
interactions throughout my career it

19
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:11,869
I've met so many people and I find oh my

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,500
god she's piece from Cornell she's from

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:19,460
Cornell you know Cornell it has a

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,840
reputation for or graduating a lot of

23
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:23,750
people I realize there's a lot of

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,000
molecular work and bigger focus on the

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,189
molecular end of things but what I've

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,590
noticed over my career is is that a lot

27
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,420
of the people I've interacted with have

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,689
good basic knowledge but they're also

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,659
able to reach out to the growers and and

30
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:42,109
of course in I do revert a lot of very

31
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:44,269
applied work and having and so I have a

32
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:48,140
lot of interaction with vegetable

33
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:51,199
growers and there's just a number of

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:56,150
people from Cornell that that I've seen

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,980
over the years interact well and give a

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,170
lot of information they take the basic

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,990
information and bring it down to the

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,379
growers level and this this will always

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:08,810
continue to be important regardless of

40
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:12,109
the balance of research that's going on

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,360
the information in agriculture at some

42
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,330
point has to to get to the grower

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,880
and I think think some institutions lose

44
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,270
sight of this and there's been several

45
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,949
people from Cornell that have have given

46
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,650
me some assistance of the year

47
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:32,739
Molly John Henry Munger passed away some

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,370
years back

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,800
Tom's it er pathologist has helped me

50
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,730
out and sending me cultures and

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:48,890
diagnosing certain disease problems that

52
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:51,739
we had and just a number of people and

53
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,929
have also met a lot of people I used to

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,110
work in agricultural plastics a lot and

55
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,629
it turns out the number probably because

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,230
of the particular expertise at Cornell

57
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,780
University

58
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:08,389
a lot of those people were trained at

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:11,150
Cornell University and so so anyway this

60
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:19,819
is a real honor to be able to speak to

61
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:22,250
you and we'll get started here so your

62
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,900
carpet uh I do melon breeding but I'm

63
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,979
not going to talk about that at all cue

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:31,310
carpet is an extremely interesting crop

65
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:33,709
in all the species originated in

66
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,069
America's and North and South America

67
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:41,239
some of them had an extremely early date

68
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:44,030
and start off with C Maxima on the

69
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,939
bottom originated in and we know the

70
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:51,340
wild species it's the progenitor of C

71
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:55,329
maxima and and the interesting thing is

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,670
the distribution of this particular

73
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,850
species by the time the Europeans

74
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:06,319
colonized the Americas the distribution

75
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:08,569
was probably about like that and it

76
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,930
didn't it wasn't up in in the United

77
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,060
States or Central America and and we

78
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,728
don't have a lot of archaeological sites

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,889
where they've recovered Maxima it goes

80
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:22,069
back maybe three or four or five

81
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:24,918
thousand years ago the domestication but

82
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:27,259
it's one of the younger species oficer

83
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:31,639
Foley I'm not going to talk about it

84
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:33,740
grows at high altitude it will not its

85
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,769
will not enter cross with any of the

86
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,139
other domesticated species it has very

87
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:42,949
little variation so it's almost

88
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:46,728
monotypic but it's adapted to very high

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:49,610
elevations and not has not found a lot

90
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:53,810
of worldwide youth q carboneau mushara

91
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,960
is the that's the truck one species it's

92
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,598
most adapted to the tropics and that's

93
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,489
probably affected how it was distributed

94
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:05,019
it was originally thought to have

95
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,098
originated in Mexico because there were

96
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:10,879
archeological dates for its existence

97
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:13,788
going back like 6,000 years ago but now

98
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:18,168
they have samples that they've been able

99
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:20,389
to get from from sites in this area to

100
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:23,329
go back about ten thousand nine to ten

101
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,930
thousand years ago and it's usually in

102
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:28,788
these are archaeological sites the

103
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,910
material is preserved or seeds and

104
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:34,189
fruits pieces of fruit wine but it's you

105
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,080
see the seeds that characterized the

106
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:42,288
particularly if we have the stem of the

107
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,959
fruit the peduncle of the fruit we can

108
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:48,110
also characterize varieties that way and

109
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,049
so it is thought that it originated here

110
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,900
because there's a lot of variation and a

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,090
lot of very relic varieties that exist

112
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,639
in colombia I'm not going to talk about

113
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:02,659
a gyruss firma

114
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,969
it's mainly used for its seeds and it

115
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,070
hasn't been utilized

116
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:12,490
much throughout the world to carve it a

117
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:15,769
couple people sub specie people

118
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,579
originated in this area and again it

119
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:20,959
goes back at least 9,000 years and

120
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,050
there's been several archaeological

121
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:27,439
sites where they found this particular

122
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:32,418
species and there's another sub species

123
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:35,300
of people or viscera and it's quite

124
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:38,918
interesting that these two species the

125
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,189
wild species from which the liver came

126
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:45,120
exists down in this area

127
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:48,600
are in up into this area and so we know

128
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,459
the wild progenitor of this particular

129
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,650
species in the Native Americans

130
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,779
introduced and bred this species going

131
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,389
back about five thousand years ago and

132
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,029
it spread throughout the eastern half of

133
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,909
the u.s. not so much over in the western

134
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:08,399
half of the US whereas this species

135
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,880
originated and there's archaeological

136
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,009
sites down in southern Mexico and also

137
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:18,449
along in this area the state of Tamil

138
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:20,759
APIs in Mexico and the most interesting

139
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,610
thing is is even though these species

140
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,939
are easily possible you know you could

141
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,670
almost consider them one species but but

142
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:32,300
there was not there was no contact we

143
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,640
don't have any knowledge of contact

144
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,520
prior to the Europeans coming that these

145
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,860
species ever crossed with each other so

146
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,339
that it's very unusual to find two

147
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,860
species that were domesticated so close

148
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:50,369
to one another yes sir well apparently

149
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,419
was not a lot of human contact and so

150
00:07:50,370 --> 00:08:03,030
there wasn't a lot of inner crossing of

151
00:07:54,418 --> 00:08:04,859
these these particular species so the

152
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:09,029
variation of this species is well

153
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,919
documented and so I'm going to more talk

154
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:13,439
about the variation that relates to my

155
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,599
breeding programs but you can go back

156
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,319
into herbals back into the sixteenth

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,800
century

158
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,620
and see quite a number of quite a bit of

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,560
variation in in in in the species

160
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,329
because the Europeans when they came

161
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,750
over and conquered some of the countries

162
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:35,370
they brought back the fruit to Europe

163
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,370
and do Shayne's drawings in 1786 natural

164
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,929
history the gourds it shows about all

165
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,339
the phenotypes that exist today in

166
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,309
Cheaper by the peoples subspecies of

167
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,529
different and excuse me and then the

168
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:53,929
vegetable garden is Connie

169
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:57,259
to look at it because it shows the state

170
00:08:53,929 --> 00:09:01,519
of of the variation in in cucurbits and

171
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:03,919
other vegetables existing in the 19th

172
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,698
century and then the cucurbits

173
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,588
vegetables in New York that's always a

174
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:11,479
there's a whole series of vegetables of

175
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,990
New York that was published back then

176
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,759
and and I have copies of several the

177
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,680
vegetables and they're just fun to look

178
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:22,278
at and there's and there's a whole lot

179
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,258
of books the complete squash by Amie

180
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:30,049
Goldman was probably one of the best of

181
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:32,568
them this is this is what what was in my

182
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:35,479
greenhouse three weeks ago that came

183
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:38,599
from the field and I would just have to

184
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,629
tell you that that all of variation that

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,819
you see in all those catalogs and stuff

186
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:46,519
good share of it exists from this

187
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:49,729
particular photo I work with all three

188
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,220
species and the two subspecies and it's

189
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,949
almost it's almost overwhelming it's a

190
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,069
very daunting task for me at this stage

191
00:09:54,948 --> 00:10:00,620
in my career and these all involve

192
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:03,649
selections and we have to do cooking

193
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:11,149
tests and various evaluations on all

194
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:13,429
these squash in these two pictures so

195
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,278
cue carbonyl Maxima just to refresh your

196
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:19,068
interest or fresh your knowledge of it

197
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,409
the the main cue carbon the Maxima that

198
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:23,870
you see in supermarkets as kabocha or

199
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:26,889
buttercup we generally call a squash

200
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:32,870
buttercup it has a protruding ovary

201
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:35,149
whereas we in Asian countries they've

202
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,339
gotten rid of that and it's called

203
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:41,958
kabocha squash but that's a general term

204
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:44,839
in Haeju for for any small squash it

205
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,969
looks like this and so the processing

206
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,399
Golden Delicious is the main processing

207
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,459
squash there are a few hybrids but

208
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,899
mostly just open pollinated and actually

209
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:58,159
in Argentina you have summer squash

210
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,740
produced they let it grow a little

211
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,958
bigger than our summer squash in order

212
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,450
to get big enough but there they do use

213
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,609
it as a summer squash and then

214
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,820
there's several others that I can't show

215
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:16,090
but the giant show pumpkin are really

216
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:19,940
really an anomaly the size is just

217
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:22,190
unbelievable when those and then if we

218
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,170
go to Cucurbita pepo subspecies a little

219
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,550
different the Acorn group even though

220
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,709
you probably don't think of this as an

221
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:33,349
acorn this is a delicata type and a

222
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:37,639
sweet dumpling type but it's all called

223
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,800
the Acorn group and in some books these

224
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,720
the straight Nicks and the crook next

225
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,539
summer squash and the scallops are all

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,850
put into separate groups I call them all

227
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,610
summer squashes course that's eaten

228
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,639
immature and I know for some reason in

229
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,080
New England and the Northeast

230
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,179
zucchinis is apini and a summer squash

231
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,180
is a yellow squash they're all summer

232
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:02,839
squash they're all they're all eaten new

233
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:05,659
mature okay and then gourds i define

234
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,970
gorgeous is squash having a hard shell

235
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:11,299
and having some ornamental value and

236
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,460
that's not always the definition getting

237
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:16,309
and then here's what I mean about you

238
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,070
curb of people subspecies people the one

239
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:22,339
that was originated and Mexico for one

240
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,680
thing the size is bigger and you'd have

241
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,290
some that are that are quite large you

242
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,089
have quite a lot of variation and color

243
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,669
these are some of my breeding lines I

244
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,160
saw in a store window when we're eating

245
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:36,979
last night I saw a lot of variation just

246
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:40,039
look just like this matter of fact it

247
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,970
was all fake pumpkins but plastic

248
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:46,789
pumpkin it's kind of discouraging and

249
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:51,670
then in the summer squash arena this is

250
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:54,589
probably that dominant dominant use of

251
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:57,379
squashes for summer squash particularly

252
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,300
the zucchini types okay and they they

253
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:04,100
were derived from the coca zel from

254
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:06,979
Italy and and these types were were bred

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,050
actually in Europe as far as we know

256
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,950
they weren't were were not bred in the

257
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:15,620
area of origin in Kew carbonyl Masada

258
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,379
I didn't start working with carbon was

259
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,870
shot until just really the last

260
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,629
12 years us all and but I had seed

261
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,080
companies come to me in the 80s

262
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:28,070
particularly libby's was was breeding a

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,050
processing this Dickenson field

264
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,379
processing type and they sent me some

265
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:36,169
lines to look at and I and I looked at

266
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,889
him a really really poor quality for

267
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:39,979
edibility

268
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,449
and and I thought well I'm not gonna I'm

269
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,920
not going to work on you carbon in my

270
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,080
shot oh there's it's just it's

271
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:48,799
butternuts and it's this Dickinson feel

272
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,750
type and I and and the seat gummies they

273
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,000
can do all the work on that I'm not

274
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,220
going to get involved with that well now

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,190
it's my biggest breeding project you

276
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,080
know and and and I'll tell you why in a

277
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,600
little bit why I'm so excited about it

278
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,660
and if you're going to into third-world

279
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,060
countries because it's we've adapted

280
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:11,839
some of these varieties so they grow in

281
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:15,349
temperate climates and some of these but

282
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,870
the calabaza that exists down in the

283
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,300
Caribbean and there's a lot of varieties

284
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:24,019
of masada that grow in Southeast Asia

285
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:25,789
and if you go to India and all the

286
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,460
squash in the market I don't have a

287
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:30,860
picture one here but later on there's

288
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,560
sort of the large cheese type you see

289
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,740
them in the market it's not type of

290
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,679
quality we would we would think for you

291
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,379
know like a but or not but but

292
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:48,649
nonetheless they're very popular in in

293
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:51,799
Asian countries the fruit of squash is a

294
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:55,100
people technically it's a modified berry

295
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,919
and in the flesh actually is derived

296
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,320
both from the ovary and it's also

297
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,929
derived from from the floral cup or the

298
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,930
receptacle and which makes it

299
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:08,809
interesting because occasionally you get

300
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:12,199
a selection and there'll be two colors

301
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:14,899
to be a real intense color in the in the

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,390
ovary part and also in the placental

303
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,159
material and then this how-to ring of

304
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:21,350
flesh will be totally a different color

305
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,839
I couldn't find a good slide of that to

306
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,820
show you because you could have gene

307
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,620
expression for carotenoids you could

308
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,140
have different expression in the

309
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,360
receptacle tissue versus the ovary

310
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:35,889
tissue kind of

311
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:40,300
fascinating it's a monisha flowering

312
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:42,250
species be pollinated bumblebees are the

313
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,609
most efficient pollinators there's also

314
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:50,440
a cucurbit B that actually evolved with

315
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:54,100
squash it needs to have open soil in

316
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,070
order to to nest and so we don't have

317
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,778
very many the squash bees at the farm

318
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,240
they're not quite as efficient as

319
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:04,870
bumblebees and also honeybees will

320
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,879
pollinate it and so I'm not going to go

321
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,429
into the intricate structure the main

322
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,480
thing is it's monisha separate male and

323
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:16,109
female flowers and they flower in the

324
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,570
morning okay I would make a beautiful

325
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,570
ornamental plant we have flowers that

326
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,579
are that big I'm not exaggerating and

327
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,670
government of people we have some that

328
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:31,000
are a foot in diameter beautiful flowers

329
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:35,229
but they will during the morning okay

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,820
and so so in that sense they don't you

331
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:42,039
couldn't bring them in a house and use

332
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:44,379
them as an ornamental so this just shows

333
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,419
the different species and they they have

334
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,179
slightly different flower structures and

335
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:51,159
when you work with them you can kind of

336
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:56,559
see that this is kind of a bell shaped

337
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:59,469
and and and this has the very deep lobes

338
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,958
in it and and the Michoud is a little

339
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,390
bit different the thing from a breeding

340
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,359
standpoint what one needs to know is

341
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,559
these flowers wilt down at different

342
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,139
times it's genetically endowed in them

343
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,240
so the kicker Berta people it often will

344
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,299
stem by 9:00 in the form by will stone I

345
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,640
mean the flower it loses its turgor and

346
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:25,418
when it loses its turgor and the male

347
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,910
flower the pollen loses its lose its

348
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,799
ability to germinate on the stigma so

349
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:35,490
you have to pollinate in the morning

350
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:38,650
okay and and so it turns out that that

351
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:41,140
subspecies or viscera is the first to

352
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,929
wilt down and so we have to pollinate it

353
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,310
by 8:00 or 8:30 then we move over to

354
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,220
this field and it's got

355
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,669
people we can pollinate it depend on how

356
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,829
how cloudy or sunny it is we can

357
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,860
pollinate it late and then them a shot

358
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:58,990
as we pollinate between 9:30 and 10:30

359
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:02,199
and then we then we move over the

360
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,359
Maximus it's it's the only way with a

361
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,380
small crew that we can deal with all

362
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:10,119
these species and get our work done and

363
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,390
we have to go in the day before and we

364
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:14,739
tie these flowers off and you can tell

365
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,640
when they're going to flower the next

366
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,710
day it is possible you can take a female

367
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,740
flower that's at this stage and you can

368
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,769
pollinate it and it will set fine so you

369
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,620
do have a little bit of leeway you can

370
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:34,000
also the male Paul and even before it's

371
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:35,829
shed can can be can fertilized but it's

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,140
kind of difficult to get the pollen out

373
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:45,000
so it's normally we like to have that

374
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:50,500
flower open so if you look at the head

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,440
growth curve the and this happens to be

376
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,750
a seed pumpkin example which is a little

377
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,700
bit extreme because most of the energy

378
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,869
is going into the seeds rather than in

379
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:05,590
the flesh but a pumpkins and squash

380
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:08,229
behave like any crop that produces a

381
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:10,419
storage organ like potatoes and so forth

382
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,720
in other words the vegetative growth

383
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,090
Peaks usually shortly after flowering

384
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,100
and as the Leafs and s it goes downhill

385
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:22,689
and and then you have in the pericarp

386
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:26,889
and the flesh of the pumpkins

387
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,410
you have the biomass goes is mainly

388
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,950
going into the flesh here yeah but it's

389
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:35,320
also going into the seeds so in the peak

390
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,870
the peak dry matter or the flesh occurs

391
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:43,000
earlier than it does with the seed and

392
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:45,909
so what actually happens is if the plant

393
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,880
you get too much plants in essence the

394
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,370
seed is still developing in that fruit

395
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,850
and it actually takes away starch

396
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:56,619
reserves from from the flesh you know

397
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,409
and it's important to know because if

398
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,829
you pick your few

399
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:04,529
picture fruit too early in development

400
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:06,809
then here and you want you're interested

401
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:08,700
in the flesh not the seeds you're gonna

402
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,799
have respiration occurring and you're

403
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,039
also going to have transport of sugars

404
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:17,069
from the flesh you know starts breakdown

405
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,490
and transport into the seeds so that's

406
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:22,950
it's important to have the knowledge of

407
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:26,190
of the growth cycle and this is just

408
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,710
another one it's more detailed work that

409
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,140
we did a graduate student in back in the

410
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,490
late 90s and actually looked at him real

411
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,940
growth because no one had looked at

412
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:38,430
embryo growth and if I should have had a

413
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,860
picture of a fruit cut open if you cut

414
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,110
open a fruit at 20 days after fruits

415
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,509
that are after pollination if you look

416
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:48,119
at that fruit you'll say oh the seeds

417
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:50,309
are fully developed well what it is the

418
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,669
seed coats fully developed not fully

419
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,369
developed it reaches its full size and

420
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,160
the seed size you don't see segregation

421
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:01,559
for seed size in a fruit it's a maternal

422
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,259
trait and it's determined by the seed

423
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:06,559
coat which is maternal tissue so that's

424
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:09,210
why all the seeds even if you have

425
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:13,259
segregation for seed size you don't see

426
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,450
it until the next generation okay and so

427
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,809
what happens if you opened up that seed

428
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:21,420
at 20 days I do I should have put in a

429
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,659
picture that but the the embryo is very

430
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,720
small only a couple of millimeters B and

431
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,680
so the embryo reaches near full size in

432
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,559
the next 20 days but it actually

433
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,350
accumulates lipids and proteins up to 55

434
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,990
to 60 days and so it's important to know

435
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:42,689
the actual fruit growth if you look at

436
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,759
the fruit growth curve depends on the

437
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,460
size of the fruit if it's a small board

438
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,279
actually the the fruit reaches maximum

439
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:56,100
size in about 12 days and some of the

440
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:59,250
acorn squash 15 to 18 days and in in

441
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:01,589
like a pumpkin a 25 pound pumpkin will

442
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,720
reach its full size about 20 faith I'd

443
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,449
be if you're talking about the shell

444
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,539
pumpkins the only reason I know this is

445
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,610
is I give given talks to to these

446
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,940
growers are fanatics about growing these

447
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,398
big

448
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,278
pumpkins farmers that's what they

449
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:20,099
knew their girl they show pumpkins and

450
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:22,528
so one had a nice growth curve of a show

451
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,378
pumpkin he majored circumference over

452
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:28,048
time I was really amazed these so

453
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:32,369
pumpkins are still growing in girth at

454
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:35,069
60 days at 60 days it's pretty amazing

455
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:37,648
quite a different curve from this curve

456
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:41,339
and again the meso carpet dry weight the

457
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:45,058
starch content Peaks piece really close

458
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,490
to 30 days 35 days and then it generally

459
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:51,119
usually goes down again this is with a

460
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:54,269
seed pumpkin and so again in the case of

461
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,719
the seed pumpkin it's you know it's it

462
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:59,638
needs mesocarp it needs to get sugars

463
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,829
from the mesocarp so the meso carb goes

464
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:05,459
down a little in order to feed the

465
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:08,069
embryo growth and when I talk about

466
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,929
pumpkins to growers this is just a chart

467
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:13,168
I would show pump and gourd because it's

468
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:15,210
a little different in a pumpkin all you

469
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,549
need is an orange pumpkin right and so

470
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,740
that color change usually occurs between

471
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:23,700
25 and 40 40 days after pollination

472
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,038
there's some varieties are a little

473
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,069
later but most most varieties some of

474
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,859
them reach full color by by maybe 32

475
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:33,839
days after pollination well can you

476
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,519
harvest the grower always ask well can I

477
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,168
harvest my pumpkins right after they

478
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,960
turn once I said yeah go ahead

479
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:43,110
you know and if you have a healthy plant

480
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,840
the the pea Dunkel will be fine the stem

481
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,490
of the pumpkin that's in bringing

482
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,019
pumpkins that's the most important part

483
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,089
if you don't have a good stem if you

484
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,788
can't carry a pumpkin out of the field

485
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:56,849
on its stem it it's not good and so it

486
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:58,950
turns out that cellulose and lignin most

487
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,678
of that is the accumulated and the pre

488
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,350
Dunkel most of it by 30 days and there's

489
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,500
a difference in varieties on that and so

490
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:12,418
and again it's it's we actually did a

491
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:16,019
study of pea Dunkel dry matter and dry

492
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,809
weight in pumpkin because you have to

493
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,878
know that okay and in order to know when

494
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:23,730
when to harvest it but of course the

495
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,919
seeds not mature by then so in my work

496
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:30,000
my timeline for my cue carpet breeding

497
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,970
projects at UNH my first I was bringing

498
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,670
melons all since I started I won't talk

499
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,650
about melons but it but I started off I

500
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,500
was only breeding working with two

501
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,720
carbon a Maxima for a number of years

502
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,619
and I'll be honest with you my first

503
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,430
variety and Maxima came out in 1981

504
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:52,500
well that's 13 years of breeding to

505
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,140
produce my first variety that doesn't

506
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,599
say too much maybe about my breeding

507
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,450
experience a very difficult project I

508
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,480
was trying to put Bush genes into a

509
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,460
large fruited processing pumpkin because

510
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,500
there was a huge processing industry in

511
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,900
New England and the Northeast at the

512
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,140
time in the Golden Delicious type and I

513
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,750
had a particular ideal type of pumpkin

514
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,400
that I envisioned a more upright Bush

515
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,710
pumpkin would be more efficient

516
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,930
photosynthetic lean and we did a lot of

517
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,779
background work you know comparing the

518
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,720
the phenotype of the bush and the leaf

519
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,160
area and in light interception and and

520
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,769
so forth I'm not going to go into that

521
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:37,110
but it was a pretty difficult product

522
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:39,690
well in in in the lines you see that are

523
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:42,719
in in dark these are the projects where

524
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,940
I've spent the most research time on but

525
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,799
they're not the projects from a

526
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,259
standpoint to getting something into the

527
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,000
industry we're successful and that's I

528
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,700
think that's how it is an institution

529
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,039
you work on some projects that seed

530
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,880
companies wouldn't necessarily work on

531
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,349
but maybe those will never be successful

532
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,690
at getting something into the seed

533
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:07,980
industry so with me because I like to

534
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,110
breed an end product I tried to have

535
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,110
enough projects so I could introduce

536
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:14,969
varieties into the seed market you know

537
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:17,039
so the growers would think I was

538
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,900
actually doing something at UNH

539
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,659
you know if you're a breeder and you

540
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,820
there for 13 years and you don't have

541
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,680
much to show for it and you go to a

542
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,899
grower meeting you're giving a talk and

543
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,130
they're shaking their head you know what

544
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:36,390
the hell's lloyd doing you know I mean

545
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:38,580
that's always bothered me so what

546
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,900
happened to the to this bush strain well

547
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:43,289
AG wait

548
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,750
and so forth well the processing

549
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:48,629
companies they're kind of they're back

550
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,930
in the 19th century you know in terms of

551
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,850
their how they space things and so they

552
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,610
were used to growing the processing

553
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:58,980
pumpkins twelve by twelve and and that

554
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:01,049
was their cultivation system it doesn't

555
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,019
matter what we told him I could tell him

556
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:06,720
look you need high-density planning you

557
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,940
need to plant this bush strain you know

558
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,710
close spacing and give them a spacing

559
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,500
but you go out in her field

560
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,390
it was 12 by 12 and they were telling me

561
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,759
well it doesn't yield well no a bush

562
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,830
plant that's that's three to four feet

563
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,420
in diameter at twelve foot space she's

564
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:24,210
not going to give a very good yield is

565
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,160
it you know so so what happened in New

566
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,200
England by the time I got my first

567
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,620
variety the processing industry was gone

568
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,140
I mean just gone left by the by the

569
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:36,649
completely by the mid nineteen eighty

570
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,030
five well I continue these lines

571
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,280
processing lines I add them and turns

572
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:43,259
out now that I'm actually using some of

573
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,789
those process processing lines for

574
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:49,529
breeding rootstocks for melon okay so so

575
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:51,990
I'm glad I kind of hung on to the hose

576
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:54,089
but and the same thing I use the bush

577
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,849
the Bush genes that I've accumulated

578
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,500
because it's it's not just one Bush gene

579
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:00,750
as you seem to look at you're actually

580
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,660
maximum others we've identified three

581
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,519
Bush genes and so and they're all in

582
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,430
completely DOM and it's so difficult to

583
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,789
work with and so we we have developed a

584
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:14,060
number of Bush lines high-quality again

585
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:17,789
all our material was a very low quality

586
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:20,159
you know in in terms of starch content

587
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:22,490
and the genes for increasing starch

588
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,060
content it's a quantitative trait

589
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,569
somewhat difficult

590
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:29,369
Hollis pumpkins I started the work and

591
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:31,889
was doing a lot of work on you know well

592
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:36,119
what's the composition of the hall and

593
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,590
this and that and and and had a fair

594
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,979
number of graduate students work on

595
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:43,799
Hollis heated pumping well it's not a

596
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,549
it's not an easy industry to get going

597
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,829
in the u.s. North America all a lot of

598
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,619
the snack food companies trail mix

599
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,579
company say they would like North

600
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,109
America

601
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:59,259
they'd like seed available from North

602
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:01,479
America they relied on China hey there

603
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,038
was a down year in China two years ago

604
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,048
they didn't produce enough seat

605
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,970
so all these trail mix companies are

606
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:09,730
crying for crying for seed and all

607
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,009
saying well we want some North America

608
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,649
growers what they don't want and not

609
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:16,569
they're not willing to have contract you

610
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:19,658
can't ask the grower to come up with a

611
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:22,450
million dollars for the harvesters seed

612
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:24,909
cleaners the seed dryers and all you

613
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,090
need for this crop without having

614
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:30,700
long-term contracts and so I do have a

615
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:33,128
few varieties coming out and working

616
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,980
with a with a processing company in

617
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:37,658
Illinois now on the Hollis pumpkin so

618
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,659
maybe something will come of that

619
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:44,409
barnaby Lumpkins pretty easy to breed

620
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:46,659
you know I can't claim I was a genius

621
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:51,009
working with these I've got a lot of

622
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:53,440
varieties probably 30 varieties or so

623
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:55,720
I'll have my germ plasm in high you know

624
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,379
just one of those things you know we're

625
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,509
a squash you know I think I got a total

626
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:05,849
of nine varieties of squash you know but

627
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:05,849
I've spent a lot of time breeding squash

628
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:14,589
and it's for some reason my computer

629
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:17,788
just won't my great computer won't

630
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:21,939
accept the changes I'm a change this

631
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:25,240
table a million times anyway just of it

632
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,690
is when I came in 1967 these are the

633
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,269
number of genes that were described for

634
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,548
these three species if you looked in the

635
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:36,159
leadership now maybe I might have missed

636
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:39,519
a few in the literature but but pretty

637
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:44,940
much this is it and half of them were

638
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:47,259
described wrongly at the wrong

639
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:51,340
inheritance model for them or whatever

640
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:54,000
okay and in 2017 these are just jeans

641
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:56,259
firm for morphological traits

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,148
morphological traits okay it's not

643
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:03,099
including the genes for disease reserves

644
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:05,158
but even 2017 approximately 20 genes in

645
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:07,279
covered a Maxima that you can trace to

646
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,720
morphological traits there

647
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,369
and people and mine and Machado that is

648
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,059
really not much at all

649
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:19,489
okay most most of the genetics I work

650
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,740
with I'm not gonna say most of I mean I

651
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,470
mean I work with a lot of those genes

652
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,559
but but there's so many so much

653
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:30,019
variation that I work with this actually

654
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:33,399
there's no genetic information on it

655
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:36,139
except what's in my breeding book and so

656
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,780
as a breeder you've got two directions

657
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,420
you could go you know if I find if I

658
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:44,569
find five traits I can either spend all

659
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,269
my time you know producing isogenic

660
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,789
lines and making the crosses you know to

661
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:52,910
publish an inheritance study but I can

662
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:57,200
release some varieties to grow I've made

663
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:59,930
the selfish choice perhaps to breed

664
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,380
varieties for the growers and maybe I'll

665
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:06,320
write a book small book sometime just

666
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,200
just detailing you know kind of what I

667
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,200
know about these descriptive

668
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,299
morphological traits and I go back to my

669
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,120
first breeding course was when I was an

670
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:19,909
undergraduate at Oklahoma State in this

671
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:24,339
chart and an old breeding book by Allard

672
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:26,960
I've really struck me you know because

673
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:29,359
because you see all this variation in

674
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,880
plants and and I was actually doing

675
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,609
special projects for couple breeders and

676
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,430
Oklahoma State at the time and I'm

677
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:40,490
seeing oh my gosh we have if you had

678
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,410
four recessive genes in a perfect

679
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:46,009
population this is like your punnett

680
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:50,150
square perfect population only one out

681
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:53,299
of 256 plants would have all four of

682
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:56,450
those genes homozygous okay

683
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:59,269
in other words true breeding that's just

684
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,759
with four four genes now you're in much

685
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,950
better shape you know about a about a

686
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,160
third if it was all dominant genes about

687
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:10,130
a third of the plants would would at

688
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:14,930
least have at least one dominant gene

689
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:16,700
and you know but and if you're lucky

690
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,920
enough to work with traits with a have

691
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,210
incomplete dominance you're a little

692
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,700
better off because you can see it's

693
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,870
the recessive phenotype the dominant

694
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,970
phenotype in the intermediate phenotype

695
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:33,719
but in squash this is important because

696
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:36,179
your population size is limited the

697
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,089
biggest population I ever used in squash

698
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:41,519
was four hundred and fifty plants for

699
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:45,148
250 plants a wheat breeder would laugh

700
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,859
at that it was a wheat breeder that that

701
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:49,579
was teaching his course I was taking you

702
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:53,189
know of course he he was talking about

703
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:56,730
populations probably you know f2 3000

704
00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:00,778
wheat plants or something you know you

705
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:03,019
know in an acre in an acre of squash

706
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:05,460
breeding where we have guard rows and

707
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:08,309
different plots and so forth you're

708
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,230
talking six to nine and whether it's

709
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:14,219
Bush or bond you're talking six to nine

710
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:17,128
hundred plants you know could be per

711
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,588
acre Zsasz all you can grow you know and

712
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:22,858
you're not going to devote all that to

713
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:25,918
just one cross and and so it's quite

714
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:30,088
restrictive and remember it's not self

715
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:33,269
pollinating species so any any plant

716
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:36,509
that we save for the next generation has

717
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:38,849
the flowers have to be tied off you do

718
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,649
your self pollination and then that

719
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:46,050
continues the next generation okay and

720
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:48,690
you can occasionally if like in summer

721
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,940
scores particularly if if you didn't get

722
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,470
a self pollination and you've already

723
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,750
made you know summer squash you're

724
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,819
already selecting what you need you know

725
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,829
by the time you pollinate it because

726
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,830
you're interested in the immature fruit

727
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:04,920
then that's you could make cuttings and

728
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:06,900
take those to the greenhouse and

729
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,210
occasionally we have taken cuttings late

730
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,940
to season but often you can't as soon as

731
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,250
the growing point gets again starts to

732
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:17,338
senesce you can get your cutting to root

733
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,809
but we've tried different hormones and

734
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,449
everything we can't get the growing

735
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:23,338
point we can we could do it in in tissue

736
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:27,598
culture but we're not willing to go

737
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:30,000
there the same way this is just a it's a

738
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,460
simplified example but it kind of shows

739
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,510
what you're up against a lot of the

740
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,920
traits we work with like starts

741
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:42,190
and seed size and food size some extent

742
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,930
are essentially what we call had a

743
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,119
tea-tray if their quantitative would

744
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:47,769
call them additive if they're more

745
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,869
qualitative traits we say incomplete

746
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:52,750
dominance but a since you're talking

747
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:55,509
about where your where your small a

748
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,139
here's like had zero increment of growth

749
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:01,660
this one increment growth - incremental

750
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:03,250
growth of course the different genes you

751
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,469
know don't all affect the trait in the

752
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,579
same way but the point I want to make

753
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:12,809
here is if you have a quantity trait

754
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:15,849
that has had at the genetic variation

755
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:20,019
like in case of starts content it works

756
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:22,420
out very nice because you know that when

757
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:25,449
you get your highest starch content in a

758
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:27,789
population you're likely to have a lot

759
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:29,859
of homozygosity and this is what we

760
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:32,800
found and for you if you're breeding a

761
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,990
processor where you want low very low

762
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,080
dry matter content you might be down at

763
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:40,389
this end if you try to select for if you

764
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,230
make a wide cross with something high

765
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:46,809
starch low starch then in here you're

766
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:51,250
going to get some homozygosity some

767
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:52,750
homozygous lines and and some of them we

768
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,670
can have different combinations which

769
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,769
which would give you the same starch

770
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,139
content but you have a lot of

771
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:01,780
heterozygosity makes selection very

772
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:05,049
difficult okay and remember you're

773
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:09,040
dealing with small populations another

774
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:11,220
aspect that's important in if I'm

775
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,139
dealing with all three species is

776
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:17,169
sometimes it's desirable to transfer

777
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:20,829
traits between the species I'll forget

778
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:23,019
Maxima times people okay very difficult

779
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:23,920
to transfer genes there's just too much

780
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:26,949
stability

781
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,940
I tried this early on and didn't have

782
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:32,500
any luck and actually why there's some

783
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,889
traits I wanted to transfer between

784
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,670
carpet people acorn squash and butternut

785
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:39,730
squash

786
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,740
I could never tried for five years to

787
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,050
make that cross and couldn't get it to

788
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:46,029
work I'll tell you in a second how I got

789
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,710
it finally got it to work but had to use

790
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:51,730
embryo culture

791
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:54,010
your carbonyl Maxon mushara if maximum

792
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,679
is a female it's often you can give very

793
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,940
good seed yields in this cross but the

794
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,399
f1 is sterile

795
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,079
okay and so there's a lot of still

796
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,450
externality berries in the next

797
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,569
generation usually you can backcross

798
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:11,529
using your f1 as a female you can back

799
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:14,769
cross and but the point I want to make

800
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:17,980
is is it's not cut and dried you can't

801
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:21,849
just say well you can cross Maxima time

802
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,579
as chaton know I could I could take 20

803
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:26,800
lines and I can make this cross some of

804
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:29,588
them would cross very well some of them

805
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,789
wouldn't cross at all some of them give

806
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:35,559
some fertility and basically with what

807
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:37,420
we know maybe when we get molecular

808
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,719
markers and we understand the genes of

809
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,150
control is fine we could we could find

810
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:47,289
the parents they're going to cross but

811
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:50,230
it's just a hit miss you know situation

812
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:52,769
you know we were forced in Maxima that

813
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:56,199
one of my processing Bush processors

814
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:58,030
combines very well with my shotta all of

815
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:00,489
all the virtually all the different

816
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:03,099
Machado strains cross well with this one

817
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:07,659
strain of C Maxima but it's not always

818
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:11,470
to do and I told you I couldn't cross a

819
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:14,440
cornyn in Machado but I was able to make

820
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:17,379
a cross of a corn and pumpkin which is

821
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,570
in the other subspecies and I was able

822
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,358
to cross after my shot on I got seven

823
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,900
seeds we were able to culture those and

824
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:28,150
get five plants out of it and with those

825
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,820
five plants I was able to back cross in

826
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:34,420
either direction and so why were we

827
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,619
interested in that well acorn squash

828
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,570
have very low carotenoid content

829
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:44,710
carotenoid is one of the key nutrients

830
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:46,750
in squash and so this is just work we've

831
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,039
just been doing lately because I just

832
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,858
started working with interspecies

833
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:54,219
hybrids but anyway we think this is much

834
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:57,338
higher carotenoid levels both of these

835
00:39:54,219 --> 00:40:00,699
have much higher carotenoid levels then

836
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:01,519
then we have in acorn squash probably

837
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,039
probably

838
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,699
this one is probably I'd say three or

839
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:10,369
four times what we usually see so it

840
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:12,500
really I would upgrade the nutrition if

841
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:16,309
we could get this level of carotenoid

842
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,869
into acorn acorn squash which is an

843
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:22,279
important squash acorn butternut and

844
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,400
Buttercup Kubota those are the three

845
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,190
major squash from supermarket so we took

846
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:32,090
the same squash and crossed to Masada

847
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:35,210
and got enough seed so we could grow out

848
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:38,450
15 plants and those plants segregated

849
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,880
for intense pretty intense carotenoid

850
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:45,349
content and we're able to cross that

851
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:49,490
with acorn only got a few seeds partial

852
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:53,809
embryos we're hoping this winter that we

853
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:56,479
can culture those do an embryo culture

854
00:40:53,809 --> 00:41:00,860
and recover plants to continue that

855
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,320
project I actually first interested in

856
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,320
these interspecies hybrids was to make

857
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:09,110
cross between Maxima Golden Delicious

858
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,840
and a processing type like large cheese

859
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,720
or Dickenson field and we wanted to see

860
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,390
what the yield would be in the f1 and

861
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:20,929
the reason for that is we hide I patha

862
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:24,710
psious that because these f1 hybrids are

863
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:27,199
sterile they don't produce seeds that we

864
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,329
could increase yield because all the

865
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:32,169
photosynthate energy could go to the

866
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:35,929
flesh and not the seed and sure enough

867
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,639
and we got a nice phenotype it's semi

868
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:41,839
bush because we're crossing bush times

869
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:45,199
vine and and the yields we're really

870
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:49,250
quite staggering compared to our check

871
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:52,789
which was a Dickinson field type I got

872
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,980
from rube seeds the dry matter yield was

873
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:56,900
almost double in this particular

874
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,010
interspecies hybrids some of them don't

875
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:05,450
work at all some of them have produced

876
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,640
misshapen fruit another avenue of

877
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:10,429
research because the interspecies hybrid

878
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:13,159
even if we get higher yield the

879
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:15,980
processor is not likely to adopt it

880
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:18,710
because the difficulties in secret

881
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,960
but so we've been using some of the

882
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:24,619
interspecies hybrids as rootstocks for

883
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,019
melon to overcome vine decline that

884
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,930
occurs throughout the Northeast and

885
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:32,809
melon and sure enough we can overcome

886
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:35,659
that saw borne disease quite easily on

887
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:38,630
root stocks we can increase yield by 50%

888
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:41,179
and also extend the growing season we

889
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,858
think this this could be important in

890
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,379
the future well there's not a lot of

891
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:51,650
milk melon a coverage in New England but

892
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:55,970
still we're and the seeds a seed

893
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:57,440
production is again expensive and one of

894
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:00,399
the things they've been able to do is

895
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,858
we've been able to take some of these

896
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:08,410
Maxima intermediate Maximus strains and

897
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:11,150
cross them to but or not and I

898
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:14,598
originally the idea of this we wanted to

899
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,760
get a butternut shape in maxima and we

900
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,230
just haven't been able to do that just

901
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,960
haven't been able to transfer those

902
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,869
genes back to Maxima but the interesting

903
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,599
thing is through a series of crosses we

904
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:29,180
did end up with with pretty much

905
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,660
standard butternut and that's only after

906
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:34,818
a few back cross 3 back crosses to

907
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,269
Machado we since you have a butternut

908
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:37,730
time

909
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:41,630
what's advantage this this the seat

910
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:44,630
fertility is a hundred percent so if if

911
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:48,318
we can use if we can take this and cross

912
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:51,769
it back to maxima and we can get 100% of

913
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,869
well-filled seeds you know and if it's

914
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:58,000
compatible with melon and gives the same

915
00:43:53,869 --> 00:44:00,890
melon yield and disease resistance then

916
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,019
it could be a major breakthrough in the

917
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,538
industry because normally when you make

918
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:08,210
these crosses a good share the seed is

919
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:10,520
not filled you go to do it and even with

920
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,528
commercial seed that we've tried you do

921
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:16,538
the grafting studies and a lot of the

922
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:16,539
seed doesn't germinate uniformly

923
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:30,649
I just I'm going to have to go through

924
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:34,660
this real quick okay but another area

925
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:37,220
variation is that we look for is in

926
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:40,899
carbohydrate source the balance of

927
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:43,429
sugars and starts that's what really

928
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,858
really determines whether a squash is

929
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:49,578
taste good or is edible there's other

930
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:54,019
other factors but sugars and starch dog

931
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:56,750
totally dominate the edibility of squad

932
00:44:54,019 --> 00:45:00,710
and then in terms of vitamin content of

933
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,880
course the carotenoids are and I'm going

934
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,420
to go through this because I'm running

935
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,900
out of time but the thing I want to show

936
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,170
you is it's very expensive to measure

937
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,869
starch content okay takes a lot of

938
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:17,869
extractions even if you send it off it's

939
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:21,349
very expensive and you need to send a

940
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:23,869
lot of material to be analyzed and so we

941
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:26,630
don't measure starch but the interesting

942
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:29,660
thing is starch is correlated very

943
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,519
strongly at harvest with the percent dry

944
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:34,489
way and we know that if you have a

945
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,769
percent dry matter in the squash up

946
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:39,078
around eighteen to twenty percent your

947
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:41,300
starch content is going to be around

948
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,089
eight or nine percent and if you have a

949
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,030
squash with that starch content has a

950
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:49,489
nice pasty texture a very desirable

951
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,819
texture and it's enough starch to

952
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:54,858
produce high sugar content so results

953
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:58,909
not good balance of sugar and starch

954
00:45:54,858 --> 00:46:02,059
then the interesting thing is in in the

955
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:04,730
commercial varieties they fall in the

956
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:07,190
two most popular or three points popular

957
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:09,858
commercial varieties they fall into dry

958
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:12,920
matter contents in in all our trials

959
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:16,039
they average about 11 percent and I can

960
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,150
I can go to a supermarket in the winter

961
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:22,039
time or most anytime and I can test

962
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:25,250
acorn squash from a supermarket not

963
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:28,039
kabocha squash or butternut acorn squash

964
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:32,150
and there they test out between nine and

965
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,340
11 percent essentially we would call

966
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,550
these

967
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:41,180
essentially we would call these in doubt

968
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:43,400
and so again we so we just get percent

969
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:46,789
dry matter so we just get these small

970
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,460
samples dry them down determined percent

971
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:52,159
dry matter sugars are expensive to

972
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,349
measure so we just get soluble solids we

973
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,230
know that correlates with sugar content

974
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:00,710
we know of soluble solids contents not

975
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,630
above 11% then the squash is not going

976
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,909
to have an adequate balance of sugar

977
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:08,390
so it makes for for pretty easy

978
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:12,170
selection and again the dry weight in

979
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:16,129
squash usually Peaks about 35 days after

980
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:18,470
pollination as I mentioned before and it

981
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,930
will tend to go down if a squash is

982
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:23,659
harvested or if the vine and if the line

983
00:47:20,929 --> 00:47:25,699
is senescent too much then actually the

984
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:29,329
dry matter will tend to degrade and

985
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:31,759
there's a again a all these squash have

986
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:34,449
have high dry matter and decent quality

987
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,990
but your commercial varieties would be

988
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:41,899
you know off the chart the same thing

989
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:44,059
with sugar we we've selected we've

990
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,160
selected inbred lines that start

991
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:49,820
degrading starts very early in

992
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,869
development and so about 45 days they're

993
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:57,140
already reaching soluble solids contents

994
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:59,719
you know twelve percent or above and so

995
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:02,750
again it leads to quality and harvest

996
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:05,989
what's the problem with that and you

997
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:10,219
know probably finish up on this is that

998
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:13,459
yield goes down his quality goes up why

999
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:14,949
is that most of you can answer that

1000
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:19,130
question

1001
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:21,829
squash produces if you have starch

1002
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:24,500
that's the main component okay that's

1003
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:27,349
the main photosynthetic reserve other

1004
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,929
than the seed so if you're getting

1005
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:32,900
squash a fruit with a lot of starch in

1006
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:35,599
it okay his requires a lot more

1007
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,809
photosynthetic energy and a fruit that

1008
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:42,319
has less starch and so it's not a

1009
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:45,139
one-to-one relationship because because

1010
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,160
both fruit have seed in them and maybe

1011
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:49,129
the seed is you

1012
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:51,679
lysing about say 20 to 25% of the

1013
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,318
photosynthetic energy is going into seed

1014
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:57,318
develop but most of the rest goes into

1015
00:48:54,318 --> 00:49:01,429
fruit in particularly starts development

1016
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:04,038
and so if a grower is growing squash for

1017
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:06,409
the supermarket's I can't convince that

1018
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:09,710
grower to grow my variety that tastes

1019
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:12,379
better if the supermarket his squash

1020
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,449
look nice you know and they're going

1021
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,369
into the supermarket in there that's

1022
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,919
what the supermarket wants

1023
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:22,818
why should he grow a squash that yields

1024
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,880
you know less and it's a conundrum and

1025
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:28,250
it makes it very difficult so most of my

1026
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,619
varieties I'm releasing we're going to

1027
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:33,230
smaller companies that are willing to

1028
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:36,170
market for local markets they're willing

1029
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,780
to market high-end squash I'd like to

1030
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:41,298
get a supermarket chain to market squash

1031
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:43,160
as a variety and then they could they

1032
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:45,259
can introduce a variety that has good

1033
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:48,889
eating quality they would increase their

1034
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:51,980
sales of squash it's difficult to do and

1035
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:53,719
I'll just leave you with a message if

1036
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,199
you're gonna if you're in a store and

1037
00:49:53,719 --> 00:50:00,259
you want to get an acorn squash to eat

1038
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:02,929
realize that at two weeks after

1039
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,299
pollination the ground spot where the

1040
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:08,750
squash was lying on the ground is light

1041
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:13,088
green because it doesn't it doesn't have

1042
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:15,380
the Sun you need the sunlight to get the

1043
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:18,139
chlorophyll synthesis in the in the

1044
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,079
Rhine and so if you go into a

1045
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:23,000
supermarket and take a look at this is

1046
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,430
what you often if this is a picture I

1047
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,409
took in a supermarket usually nowhere is

1048
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:31,848
when you see so when were they squash

1049
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:36,259
harvested probably between 20 and 25

1050
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:38,539
days after fruits 20 to 25 days they're

1051
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,789
totally immature there's there's

1052
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:44,660
literally no sugar in them they're low

1053
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:47,569
dry matter they're essentially inedible

1054
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:49,489
you know and yet this is this is what

1055
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:52,190
the stores are and it's not because the

1056
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:54,469
stores don't want quality it's because

1057
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:57,260
they don't they don't know how to

1058
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:59,250
evaluate a fruit like a corn they don't

1059
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,280
you know and you can't

1060
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:05,039
converse with him on that I mean it's

1061
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,140
just like in your head again so long

1062
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:10,469
this is interesting because this big

1063
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:12,179
chewy actually they deliver of one of

1064
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:14,549
our major supermarket chains they're a

1065
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:16,649
big grower I think you're located there

1066
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,320
the locations in Mexico in other areas

1067
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:21,780
and in the fall this was harvest in the

1068
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:24,119
fall so their source of squash in the

1069
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,570
fall at least when when you get this

1070
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:30,660
orange brown spot it means the skin has

1071
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:32,970
has accumulated carotenoids in it and

1072
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:35,639
it's probably close to at least 40 days

1073
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:38,789
after fruit set so it's got maximum

1074
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:41,219
starts Clinton might not be too high in

1075
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:44,009
sugar but this squash was actually

1076
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:49,649
edible one say it was top of the line

1077
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:51,060
but was actually edible and this is what

1078
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:54,539
I was going to show you we do all these

1079
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:58,349
cooking tests in and we have tremendous

1080
00:51:54,539 --> 00:52:01,858
variation and rotten oil content we've

1081
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:03,539
also done carotenoid profiles we can't

1082
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:06,059
do that all right at the moment because

1083
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:08,699
I don't have access to the lab but what

1084
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,769
this profile is allowed us to do we can

1085
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:13,289
identify for instance we can identify

1086
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:15,750
lines that are high in beta-carotene I

1087
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:18,869
can identify them just with the naked

1088
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:21,780
eye and we use this color fan we only

1089
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,720
use the last seven colors these colors

1090
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:27,030
don't don't correlate with carotenoid

1091
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,489
content and we can only do it with

1092
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:31,710
jakarta Mashhad and maxima the

1093
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:34,139
carotenoids are so low in an acorn that

1094
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,088
we can't use it but this is very handy

1095
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:38,670
some of the seed companies I work with

1096
00:52:36,088 --> 00:52:40,710
uses color fan it was developed for eggs

1097
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,440
and you wonder well why would that work

1098
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:46,519
for squash because eggs eggs contain

1099
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,019
xanthophylls i hydroxylated carotenoids

1100
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:52,980
you think it'd be more yellowish but

1101
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:57,539
anyway it works works fine I'm going to

1102
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:59,900
end right there on that thang yep

1103
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:06,989
question far

1104
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:06,989
[Applause]

1105
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:14,019
well I can start with the question do

1106
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:16,150
you guys actually breed for the strength

1107
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:19,659
this dumb when you're looking in your

1108
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:22,599
breeding pumpkins do it okay do I breed

1109
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:26,739
for the stem yeah you actually do

1110
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:29,140
because it's important right and so we

1111
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:31,929
did some research on runes and in

1112
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:36,659
certain varieties will accumulate lignin

1113
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:39,728
and cellulose faster than other but you

1114
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:43,568
have the same problem with with breeding

1115
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:46,149
for stem strength to some extent as you

1116
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:49,838
have for breeding starch content because

1117
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:51,039
the dry matter and the flesh the starts

1118
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,938
content in the flesh

1119
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:57,759
it's a storage organ for sugar that

1120
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:59,528
feeds into the stem and helps the stem

1121
00:53:57,759 --> 00:54:01,599
to harden okay

1122
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:04,688
and what we found is that varieties

1123
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,910
there that are lost in dry matter have

1124
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:09,969
the weakest stems so if you raise the

1125
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:12,399
dry matter in a pumpkin to get better

1126
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:16,179
stem string you tend to lower the yield

1127
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,358
Allah but we've gotten around that to

1128
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:22,749
some extent I mean that's just that's a

1129
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:25,449
good question and I might add and in

1130
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:27,938
these shell pumpkins are fanatical

1131
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,429
growers there's a there's Association

1132
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:32,528
New Hampshire and I spoke to them a

1133
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:33,910
couple of times well they want answers

1134
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:37,329
you know how can I get the largest

1135
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:39,938
pumpkin and just the physiology of why

1136
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:43,660
these pumpkins go big and just the

1137
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:47,379
physiology of growth in itself it's very

1138
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:49,748
complex you know in terms of what's

1139
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:55,269
going on and cell division and cell size

1140
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:57,698
and I have not given them I've learned

1141
00:54:55,268 --> 00:55:00,548
more from these growers and they've

1142
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:02,289
learned from me anyway it's very

1143
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,728
interesting and they're always

1144
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:06,278
interested always there's some growth

1145
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:08,548
regulators I can spray on the getting

1146
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:08,548
bigger

1147
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:21,780
any other questions storage content

1148
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:23,129
that's a good question did you hear the

1149
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,280
question is there a correlation between

1150
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:30,420
storage and stars insured content so

1151
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,370
what happens you know Pumpkins respire

1152
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,220
you know when you harvest a pumpkin or

1153
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:37,739
squash it was it was sparse so you put a

1154
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,409
squash in storage for one thing the

1155
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:43,169
carotenoid content tends to go up

1156
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:45,359
particularly in the Masada's in create

1157
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:48,450
will increase it depends on the variety

1158
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:51,990
but increases between three weeks to

1159
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:54,629
eight weeks and then and then Peaks so

1160
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:57,629
actually the vitamin content actually

1161
00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:01,740
tends to increase in not so much an

1162
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:03,570
acorn but in kabocha and the other thing

1163
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:04,349
that happens is the starts breaks down

1164
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,300
into sugar

1165
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:09,509
you have respiration so the starch

1166
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,510
starts continued breaks down and you

1167
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:16,230
tend to get a little higher sugar in

1168
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:19,890
storage so the breakdown of starch is

1169
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:22,349
usually precedes faster than the

1170
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:24,569
respiration so you tend to tend to get

1171
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:26,670
higher sugar and like in the butter nuts

1172
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:29,250
sometimes they have to be stored for

1173
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:31,650
some time in order to get the sugar

1174
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:34,260
content upward and balances with start

1175
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,720
and what they found in studies and we

1176
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,780
followed up on this new zealand's done

1177
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,819
the most thorough work on squash because

1178
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,280
it's a major export item and the

1179
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,760
government actually funds applied work

1180
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,160
on squash and what they showed is that

1181
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,150
they could they could take squash and

1182
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,170
they could treat them with high

1183
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:58,230
temperature like 30 degrees C for five

1184
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:01,889
or six days and that accelerated the

1185
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:04,110
enzymes which break down starch and and

1186
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:05,549
then they could take that squash and put

1187
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,950
it back in the preferred storage

1188
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,780
temperature say 10 degrees centigrade

1189
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:12,509
and then the degradation that would

1190
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:15,210
continue because when they ship their

1191
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:18,300
squash to Japan and it reaches the pan

1192
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:21,539
it's going to be a minimum a 20% dry

1193
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,720
matter and a minimum of 11% soluble

1194
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:25,969
solids so that were

1195
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,098
important so now when my squash comes

1196
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:29,899
into the greenhouse I tell her the

1197
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:32,300
greenhouse manager I said bump up the

1198
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:35,119
temperature for a week you know because

1199
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,560
I have to get the sugar content and my

1200
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,380
Mashhad is cuz I'm working with a

1201
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:42,199
company in New Zealand I got its in situ

1202
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,780
them so I got a I got a to cooking test

1203
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:47,779
on those squash and so that's an

1204
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:49,640
important thing thing to understand now

1205
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,260
it used to be that they they did that

1206
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:54,199
the whole squash and they do it with

1207
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:57,349
sweet potato as you Karam it turns out

1208
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:59,210
this course don't have to be cured for

1209
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:03,500
disease or anything like that because

1210
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:07,250
you know 55 60 degrees you know they're

1211
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:09,139
they can actively get Corky layers to

1212
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,239
prevent disease is really not much

1213
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:13,339
different but it turns out if you want

1214
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,108
to get if you want to sell your squash

1215
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,090
until growers if you want to sell your

1216
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:19,250
butternut squash you're growing the

1217
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:23,090
Waltham variety which happens to be very

1218
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:25,639
low in sugar and harvest most popular

1219
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:27,619
variety as the lowest sugar harvest

1220
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:30,679
approximately any variety of looked at

1221
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:32,720
and so I say well bump up the

1222
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:34,309
temperatures you know when you put them

1223
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,769
in the greenhouse for a week or whatever

1224
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:38,809
and pump up the temperature and at least

1225
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:41,119
you can start marketing them within

1226
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:42,799
three or four weeks and the customers

1227
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,750
are going to be satisfied if you eat a

1228
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,900
squash it doesn't have a balance of

1229
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:50,780
sugar in it even if it's fairly low dry

1230
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:59,289
matter it's like eating a dog ball just

1231
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:59,290
not good that was a good question yes

1232
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:07,880
well that's a question I probably can't

1233
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:10,010
answer the question was how much does

1234
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:13,400
environmental stress affect rotten wood

1235
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:16,070
content I guess it would depend on women

1236
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,849
from environmental stress occurred but

1237
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:22,490
early on I would say would you don't

1238
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:24,500
need that much sugar you know as a

1239
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:27,348
substrate for Grotta noise because the

1240
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:30,858
total content micrograms compared to

1241
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:32,900
sugar content so you know some of the

1242
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:35,420
highest brought annoy contents are in

1243
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,550
fruit with with only 6 percent dry

1244
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:43,039
matter the Dickinson feel

1245
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:59,600
type I would think an environmental

1246
00:59:43,039 --> 01:00:09,679
stress but environmental stress

1247
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:14,360
if you leave your leaf area since you

1248
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:19,940
can get a storage other thing I might

1249
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:24,620
add blind eyes it turns out to

1250
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:53,690
respiration no one's ever looked into

1251
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:56,150
this work done and seen this has been a

1252
01:00:53,690 --> 01:01:00,760
production of Cornell University on the

1253
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:00,760
web at Cornell edu
