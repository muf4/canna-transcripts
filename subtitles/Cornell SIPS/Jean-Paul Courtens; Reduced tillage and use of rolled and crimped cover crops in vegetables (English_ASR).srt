1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,169
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,199
University quickly introduction of

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,879
myself I'm currently the associate

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,359
director of pharma training and

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,690
pharmacology and I'm also the co-owner

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:22,350
of Roxbury farm in Kinderhook New York

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:25,350
which is a biodynamic farm in 425 acres

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,500
where we do vegetables and pork beef and

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,980
lamb and the last four years have been

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,980
involved in project in Hurley New York

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:38,600
it's about 1,200 acres of farm lands

12
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:41,640
class-one silt loam form a sweet corn

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,739
conventional sweet corn farm that I was

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,100
asked to help transition to organic

15
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,479
practices so most of my task has been to

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,100
help them guide them through the process

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,109
of the rotation and bringing this land

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,850
into ecological practices part of that

19
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,799
is that we're working with the farm

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,308
scape ecology program based in Harlem

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,018
Ville New York to not just look at soil

22
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,950
data we're working with the soil health

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,710
test to monitor soil we're also looking

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,930
at water quality and look at ecological

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,359
qualities on the lands and we're in our

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,460
third year at third year right now to do

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,930
this monitoring and mapping and do some

28
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:24,509
additional research but in the context

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,880
of and do I have a clicker I do in the

30
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,379
context really of the farmer training

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,819
program that we started which is really

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,078
meant to as the niche in the farmer

33
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,309
training program that we have there's a

34
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,578
lot of them around in the Hudson Valley

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,320
in New York to see if we can have a farm

36
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,728
and training program that can allow our

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,309
students to scale up a little bit

38
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,679
prepared for farm ownership so it's an

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,420
entrepreneurial training whereby we

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,970
really want to prepare them for farm

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,680
ownership and with the ability to be

42
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,780
exposed somewhat to working with

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,310
equipment one of the things that I do

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,390
with our students is that I really want

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,170
to push them a little hard it's a

46
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,129
non-profit we have a very cushy

47
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,759
environment in the sense that we can

48
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:07,578
make mistakes so I love making mistakes

49
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,280
I've done in all my life and

50
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:11,709
we're happy to continue doing that while

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,270
being paid for it

52
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,009
and so one of the things that we were

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,959
really struggling with is that yes we

54
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,739
know how to grow vegetables but can we

55
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,750
grow vegetables in an ecological way and

56
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,730
we all know that the one thing that we

57
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,870
bump up against with organic vegetables

58
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:32,598
is really that we do a lot of tillage

59
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,300
people who know me know that I like to

60
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,189
work with you know weeding equipment and

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,469
keeping my fields clean although I also

62
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,609
have worked very extensively with cover

63
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:45,199
crops very long ago we adopted an or

64
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,090
dell system is anyone familiar with the

65
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,548
nor Dells

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,400
everybody is they are my heroes so we

67
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,860
have been you know alternating on a

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,200
vegetable farming Kinderhook with cover

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,019
crops one year green manures and then

70
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,909
vegetable crop adopts in the other year

71
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,280
we've actually improved our soil health

72
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:06,590
that way I know I heard a lot today

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,840
about saying that we cannot increase

74
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,489
organic matter with cover crops alone my

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,229
question is really how tall were these

76
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,930
cover crops because we have really

77
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:19,429
brought our organic matter up from about

78
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,159
1.2 1.4 to 2.4 it's not a lot that takes

79
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,459
15 years to get there but one of the

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,259
things is is it another farm that I

81
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,959
transition from very intensive

82
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:32,419
vegetables to organic vegetables is that

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,009
we inherit the two farms where with the

84
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,358
excessive amount of phosphorus and

85
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:38,149
excessive amount of potassium in the

86
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:39,980
soil so bringing in animal fertilizer

87
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,709
was not an option for us the only way

88
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,689
that we could complement really growing

89
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,819
organic vegetables was by bringing

90
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,699
significant amount of nitrogen into a

91
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:52,159
system by fixing nitrogen out of the air

92
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:54,138
and also by doing that we have also

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,299
fixed immense amount of carbon out of

94
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:58,969
the air all right go back to the pro

95
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,549
farmer training I'm pushing them to do

96
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,049
something more innovative so we set like

97
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,959
okay we've looked at all the stuff that

98
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,879
being done with minimum till vegetables

99
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,969
and we're going to try a couple of

100
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,329
things oh I lost the screen oh here we

101
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,109
go

102
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,549
so we do quite a bit of conventional

103
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,620
till vegetables their curriculum is

104
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,478
based on five groups of vegetables of

105
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,240
which some of the groups of the

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,639
vegetables in the Brassica the Brassica

107
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,840
is one group lent themselves quite well

108
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,699
for a particular part in the season not

109
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,549
for the early brassicas but definitely

110
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:38,449
for the later brassicas to be planned

111
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,620
and enrolled and crimped veg or roll on

112
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:44,720
roll and creams are seen field piece

113
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,910
also the other group that we have are

114
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,930
the legumes lend themselves very well to

115
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,970
be plant a true rolled and cream dry oh

116
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,870
by the way my apologies if anyone

117
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,020
thought of it's going to talk about

118
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,120
mixed species here I'm not talking about

119
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:03,639
mixed or mixtures here it's pretty

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,860
simple debt or rye we really wanted to

121
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,800
address the whole idea about if you are

122
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,240
planting your brassicas in Rye we

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,060
already know that we're going to be

124
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,500
having to bring in a lot of nitrogen to

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:23,120
offset the the fact that the Rye is so

126
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:26,269
high in in carbon so we want to make

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,709
sure that we could bring the veg the

128
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:30,469
vegetable bring in the night if you need

129
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:32,239
it for the brassicas to grow oh actually

130
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,860
let me tell you one thing I'm all think

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,728
I'm not going to really talk much about

132
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:40,370
the edamame and the snap beans those are

133
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:43,459
kind of like the easy ones we've been

134
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,490
growing at the farm hub soybeans

135
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:49,189
truevolt and creme dry for a number of

136
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,220
years we've gotten pretty good at it

137
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:54,680
pretty good weed control in there so I

138
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,259
think we learned there the snap beans

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,759
work equally well we were a little

140
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,110
concerned with the Machine harvesting

141
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,819
we're gonna pick up the rice straw

142
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,129
wasn't an issue at all

143
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:09,469
what I want to focus on is more on this

144
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:14,029
one here Washington winter peas also we

145
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:18,110
tried field piece with bell beans that

146
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,899
did not work I've you know used for many

147
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,960
years a rotation mabye I planned field

148
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,698
peace and bail beans in the spring and I

149
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,019
worked them under and that gives us up

150
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,750
to two hundred pounds of nitrogen to

151
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:32,139
grow our broccoli cauliflower

152
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,399
and cabbage actually I know that we are

153
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,050
fixing that much because Laurie

154
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,359
Drinkwater had a graduate student go out

155
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,819
and actually find out how much we were

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
actually fixing and we don't put any

157
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,680
fertilizer down except boron to grow

158
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,689
these crops when we're old and crimp

159
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,730
them they disappear too fast

160
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:53,889
you actually went to pee stayed around a

161
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:56,650
little bit longer so we using a crimper

162
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,110
everybody familiar with it but then also

163
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,089
what we do is we were thinking like how

164
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,920
we're gonna kill it all in one shot

165
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,289
well we were thinking about us at the

166
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,090
performance we went around and we said

167
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,420
like well when you just cut it it's in

168
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:11,919
you know an indeterminate crop so the

169
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,720
problem with that is is that a flowers

170
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,090
at different times so either we're going

171
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,160
to roll it three times and going over it

172
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:20,979
or we're gonna try to kill it all of one

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,600
so we just hooked behind our track that

174
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,879
we hooked to the no-till drill and we

175
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,450
just cut it and the cutting actually

176
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:31,659
immediately killed it so this is what it

177
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:35,019
looked like when a good stand of the RC

178
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,130
winter piece and then the other thing we

179
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,589
wanted to resolve it how are you gonna

180
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:42,159
plant through that we have some funding

181
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:46,659
we bought this rej planner that Ryan

182
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,500
uses as well and free fill and we got

183
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,290
that's from you and we enjoyed working

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,310
with it except that we think that maybe

185
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,860
it is more than what we really need what

186
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,209
we founding is that we really don't need

187
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,479
some of the equipment on that we took

188
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:06,489
the row cleaners off almost immediately

189
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:09,819
they made a mess and then also the

190
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,189
Shengo is this cool liquor here this

191
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:16,000
here is a shank here that they insisted

192
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,800
to have on there we took that off the

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,750
ground is pretty soft in a minimum till

194
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,500
system this is not a no-till system by

195
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,939
any means so we took great care in

196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,639
preparing the seed Beth in the year

197
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:30,430
before and then really all you need

198
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,860
really to plant into a crop like this

199
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,320
it's really a double disc opener and

200
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,389
then over here is a wavy Coulter if you

201
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,580
have this in the double disc opener you

202
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,000
can use any transplanter to get your

203
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,910
crop in the ground

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,470
can see here how that works so here's

205
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:52,230
after planting this is 26th of June and

206
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,750
then it grew and then you can see the

207
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,039
weeds who are coming in so here we

208
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,309
definitely saw we didn't have enough

209
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:02,099
biomass to really have good weed control

210
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:03,599
but there was good growth in it and so

211
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,750
what we ended up doing we went to it

212
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,420
with a little stone rolling cultivator I

213
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,458
had to clean it off after every pass but

214
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,878
otherwise it worked relatively decent

215
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,318
and then we have the crew hand how it

216
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,300
unfortunately I cannot ship how many she

217
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:25,620
took this is a point seven acre piece

218
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:28,078
that we handheld and but you know it

219
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,769
it was definitely about between 40 and

220
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:34,919
50 hours that I remember that we spent

221
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:37,169
on that that's a lot of hours again you

222
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,078
know cost was not an issue for us this

223
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:45,299
is a learning experience so it kept

224
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,708
growing and then let me see you can see

225
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,539
there's some weeds going in there but at

226
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,278
this point the canopy starts to close up

227
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,438
you can see the weeds are growing a

228
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,129
little higher now this is really

229
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,230
interesting

230
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:58,409
I believe I hope this this slides on the

231
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,079
same day they're not the same day you

232
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:03,028
can see here this is really important

233
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,198
for me this is observation I mean none

234
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:06,120
of it is what I'm bringing to you as

235
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:08,250
research this is really like us trying

236
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,438
some things out and throwing some you

237
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,620
know paint at the wall and see what

238
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:17,429
sticks but this is interesting

239
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,889
irrigated equally the plot we they

240
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,739
decide by side comparison its wilting

241
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,180
and if you look at this one here even

242
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,610
with the weed competition

243
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,299
there's no wilting over here so that's

244
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,750
pretty striking so we were very happy

245
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:37,669
with that

246
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:42,899
so then we harvested it and let me see

247
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:44,278
after mowing and yield is not great but

248
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,058
it's about the same it is not

249
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:51,350
conventional plots so that's the first

250
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:51,350
one that I want to share with you

251
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:58,240
then the vet we tried that as well same

252
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,190
thing it's an indeterminate plant so we

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,779
wanted to cut it which we didn't do with

254
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,060
the Rye by the way with arriving just

255
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,970
waited until an tesis rolled it and

256
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:11,049
rolled it again after the soybeans came

257
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:13,620
over the edamame came up here we go you

258
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:17,429
can see it's all cut you can see those

259
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,289
how'd it's all cut okay this is actually

260
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:22,479
just a slide again but this is corn we

261
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,769
also did corn or this is actually meant

262
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,920
for the corner but do a color flower

263
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:31,929
later this is corn one more slide of

264
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:35,649
that corn after planting in the vets so

265
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:39,579
and we actually saw much better weed

266
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:45,360
control in the corn from the vets then

267
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:50,050
we saw in the Austrian field peace right

268
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:54,250
corn again observations very healthy

269
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:58,120
crop again less the wilting point was

270
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:00,990
you know of such a degree that it didn't

271
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,070
seem to suffer as much with a hot days

272
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,169
compared to the other but you can see

273
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:11,129
some weeds coming in though but the

274
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:14,339
canopy is closing up and then you see

275
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:19,269
these are all irrigated fields I will

276
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:25,240
mention that to you and then this is

277
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:27,009
close to harvest we had 300 back to

278
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,690
Diego which was more than our

279
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,840
conventional till our converse was

280
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,090
around 250 250 back to the acre so

281
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,899
that's what's a surprising number to us

282
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:41,129
that we saw that the

283
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,079
ears were fuller from that lot and that

284
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:45,840
thing that has something to do with you

285
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,970
know no water stress or something to

286
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,310
save for that it's hard for us to

287
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,410
compare one lots to the other especially

288
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:55,319
when you have bird damage these are 300

289
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:58,319
backs marketable ears so you know again

290
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,570
this is not research so but still it was

291
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,310
it was a good yield and we see these

292
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,050
yields consistently when we transplant

293
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,509
corn everybody always laughs when we

294
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,699
transplant corn but we find that we can

295
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,100
plan twice as much corn from happy acres

296
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,500
to be transplant because of the stand

297
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,430
that we grow the extra tender varieties

298
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:20,190
that really don't terminate very well

299
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:23,069
alright lastly the we also transplant a

300
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,510
cauliflower true veg and I just shown in

301
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:30,020
later slides I'm not going to go through

302
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:33,000
the whole sequence again and here

303
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,069
harvesting or that is in hoeing we dead

304
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,429
they did spend some time hauling they're

305
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,650
pulling out the big weeds now when we

306
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,139
went out there we had a Fisher by Yong

307
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,569
Hendrick crop and I class Martin so he

308
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,009
mentioned him before he came by to fire

309
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,620
him up and he went out there the first

310
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,360
thing that give me a shovel and it was

311
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,679
really great and educational for all of

312
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,600
us and I should have taken slides from

313
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,838
the conventional till plots because they

314
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,389
were powdered and then here we had some

315
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,310
really it's hard to see on this slide

316
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,970
but as wormholes everywhere you can see

317
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:12,379
the worms right here and it was a really

318
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,810
remarkable difference in soil structure

319
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:19,320
this soil wasn't blocky it was nice

320
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,819
round its texture to it where it was in

321
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,879
the cauliflower compared to the

322
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,570
cauliflower was conventional till here

323
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:31,860
it may be a better shot anyone familiar

324
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:36,030
with John Hendrick crop okay

325
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,070
so September 19th that crop stays really

326
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,769
clearly that the hoeing in here was

327
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,950
relatively minimal we did pull out some

328
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:47,189
big weeds let me see

329
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,530
September 21st I don't have yield

330
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,850
numbers but here I come again with some

331
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:56,009
anecdotal stuff regarding what the crew

332
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,159
was telling me as well

333
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:01,830
they loved harvesting cauliflower in

334
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,959
that section it didn't stink it was like

335
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,450
this is a very clean section the

336
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,840
cauliflower very high-quality and it was

337
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:13,950
really the the crop did not deteriorate

338
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,379
as fast in the field again we had less

339
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,000
tip burn in this cauliflower again a lot

340
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,179
to do with the water management I think

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,279
of the soil that we were working with so

342
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,289
well this really started an experiment

343
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,370
and saying like ok we have nothing to

344
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:31,259
lose I can make mistakes and I we were

345
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,259
really pleased and we're gonna continue

346
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,470
with with this experiment

347
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:41,279
what would we change I think we well we

348
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,800
already did mix in some triticale and

349
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,250
some rye you know vets to get a little

350
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:50,490
more biomass we'll see how that works

351
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,710
we hope that the triticale and rye will

352
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,690
not dominate the veg but you know it's

353
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,970
something that to see if we get better

354
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,670
weed control now the next step is for us

355
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,480
were sold on the system the next step

356
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:06,709
right now for us will be to see if we

357
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,050
can eliminate the the hand hoeing and

358
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:13,820
that will be kind of interesting I'll

359
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:13,819
keep it short because the ipi is waiting

360
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:31,310
all right some questions right how long

361
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:34,210
oh there's a date on there so I could

362
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,209
actually tell you

363
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,760
the earlier

364
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,129
well I think I normally when I do weed

365
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,588
control

366
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:00,230
I control weeds when I can't see them

367
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,660
all right that's the normal way of

368
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,370
thinking about weeds in this case and

369
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:07,220
that's where the little sting comes in

370
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,438
the weeds were about this big we had

371
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,779
some over at carpet so hence the

372
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,029
aggressive way of using it

373
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:16,099
how many weeks it was after I have to

374
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:20,599
look up the dates again if I go back

375
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:23,208
through the slides what you know the the

376
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,328
broccoli I could not have waited much

377
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:30,470
longer because I were to be driven with

378
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:32,808
my tractor tires on the plans so pretty

379
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:37,159
soon after that the canopy started to

380
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:39,308
close but I don't get the second part of

381
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,309
your question

382
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,308
yeah

383
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:59,859
yeah we would have to this is pretty

384
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,750
weird aground so it's it's not that in

385
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:06,059
in in the conventional tail would be

386
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,059
cultivated three times by that point

387
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,879
yes I think it's the ocean filled peace

388
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,590
compared to the veg it's really the veg

389
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,190
had better weed control than arson field

390
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:25,839
piece and then if you put the the

391
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:29,900
regular 4010 field piece it's even worse

392
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,579
we abandon it we did after rolling and

393
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,560
crimping we made a visual inspection and

394
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:36,169
we walk the field and we said like all

395
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,250
right it's this going to work if we see

396
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,769
weeds right now

397
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,740
then we're not going to do it I mean we

398
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:46,099
and and some of that has to do with a

399
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,829
fall seeding of austrian field piece is

400
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:51,649
that there were very little weeds under

401
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:53,990
the Archean field peace with the 4010

402
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,650
field piece and the bell beans weeds

403
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:02,059
germinated along with the field peas

404
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:03,860
that were planted in the spring so there

405
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,259
that's what's a big difference so if we

406
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:08,689
saw weed and I wonder if anyone wants to

407
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:11,629
try this I would say that the one thing

408
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,570
that we learned from this is that we do

409
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,060
all our weeding in the year before so

410
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:19,490
the year before when before we planted

411
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,429
the field piece at arson field piece and

412
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:26,180
the vets and the Rye we had a bear

413
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,500
fallow so this is by no means like we

414
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,700
didn't do till it's we did a lot of

415
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:36,710
toilets in the year before so we made

416
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:41,090
sure we did all our toilets and so our

417
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:43,730
aim is not to be no-till our aim is to

418
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:46,759
not disturb the soil and to provide

419
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,950
greater plant health now so it really

420
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,629
has and and not to have too much erosion

421
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,630
when the plants are still young

422
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,720
by the way none of these crops got any

423
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,230
fertilizer

424
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,230
except for boron not even the corn yes

425
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:25,000
yeah that's all you have to do yeah

426
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:27,969
so pretty much I we didn't have to apply

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,849
a lot of pressure this no-till drill

428
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,200
does have hydraulic pressure but it

429
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:36,879
didn't take a lot of pressure to have

430
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:46,500
the Coulter's run and and cut the cover

431
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:46,500
crop no they don't cut underneath they

432
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,890
that that is a that is a possibility

433
00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:01,210
although I think well what are we saying

434
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,650
mad about that do you think that the

435
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,909
no-till drill what do you think the

436
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,320
action what'd you think it was the

437
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:09,030
second rolling that they're all the work

438
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,029
or is it the cutting

439
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,379
I

440
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,900
do it some of the cardigan or something

441
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,309
she's going that that way over it you

442
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,850
know you're not ready right now

443
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:33,660
then you're putting something in here

444
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:36,359
I think

445
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,820
a bit more I know but you're saying

446
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,428
about the games bills you know huffing

447
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:44,299
out there but it's not like they have

448
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:49,310
any points on

449
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:55,220
pretty soft yeah you can also drive over

450
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:56,269
it with the tractor under the wheel you

451
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,640
see a dime

452
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:59,930
Chartres you know I don't think that you

453
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,930
know that's a long long wait don't want

454
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:05,170
to turn fire here two dozen individual

455
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,170
gauge

456
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:24,259
and the one of the culture yes yeah yeah

457
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:38,730
well it just cut every seven have inches

458
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:42,118
so it's it's really these colors are

459
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,159
quite close but you might be right me

460
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:47,069
i'm we just thought what's the cutting

461
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,499
and maybe it's not the cutting but it

462
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:51,989
does work and it did killer because we

463
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:54,389
won we rolled some stuff and then we did

464
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:56,819
not like it's not dying what are we

465
00:22:54,388 --> 00:23:01,219
gonna do so like let's run over at the

466
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,220
real drill i mean again

467
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,970
any more questions

468
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:17,460
they were I mean we actually we are

469
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:21,589
going to go to a smaller plan that's

470
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:27,150
only two weeks old these plans were I

471
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:29,220
believe 18 days yeah and they were they

472
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,820
were actually they're double planned in

473
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,789
a 72 we want to go back to a double plan

474
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:38,189
than a 162 because it just took too much

475
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,549
time to carry the traits to the

476
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,840
transplanter so that was one thing that

477
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:46,619
we have to buy another shoe for that

478
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:48,419
with the RJ planner but that was one

479
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:52,529
thing we want to correct we we thought

480
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,450
we needed a big plant we had not done

481
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:58,379
this before

482
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:02,299
we can definitely stick with 162 if you

483
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,300
plan every 14 inches to plants yes

484
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:11,390
the next crop we will try aside from

485
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:16,370
those ones we're gonna stick the dose

486
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:20,150
for now but we want to try a little bit

487
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:24,829
the transfer mulch and initially tried

488
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:27,970
it on potatoes and and and bring mulch

489
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:31,009
on after the potatoes our plant that's

490
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,589
enriched and then put them all on top of

491
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:35,629
them and then not to touch them because

492
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:37,879
