1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,830
and so well we're still stalling I

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:16,189
should tell you that the last time I was

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:20,259
here in 2013 I gave the talk about

6
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:25,329
Barbara McClintock and I told you that I

7
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:28,278
was going to publish this book on her

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:31,489
publications perspectives on all of her

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:34,518
publications and reprint all of the

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:38,929
papers of the early papers that had been

11
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:41,960
collected so that's done and it's a

12
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:57,530
digital book and it's two volumes so

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:58,969
here it is so I call this the micro and

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,239
macro-evolution of Cornell's department

15
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,640
of plant breeding because I feel that

16
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,228
the original talk that we gave was

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,590
evolution of Cornell's plant breeding

18
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:11,239
department centennial history and I felt

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,920
that there were certain things that you

20
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:22,549
know sort of flowed and if you think of

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:25,280
cytogenetics I think about evolution in

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,069
a small way you know small changes but

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,429
then macro evolution and you know in big

24
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:33,859
jumps and and so what what I want you to

25
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:44,539
do as I go through this today is think

26
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:50,829
about the big changes in our and and and

27
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:53,840
and so so I'll probably macro

28
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:58,039
evolutionary changes that occurred so

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:01,450
I'd like to dedicate this talk to dr.

30
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:12,080
Murphy and Ronnie and dr. Anderson

31
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:15,289
dr. Cardy and dr. Provine whoo okay so

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,000
let me as they said if I hit this it'll

33
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:20,419
go forward

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,639
well no no no sorry too long there it is

35
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:33,699
alright so it was started by Bailey LH

36
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:41,449
Bailey right here in 1907 Bailey was the

37
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:44,089
founder of and he wanted to start and he

38
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:45,439
appointed those days we didn't do

39
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,379
searches you know you just found the

40
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,280
best person and you got somebody so he

41
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:54,949
appointed or asked Herbert J Weber to

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,189
head this new department and when Weber

43
00:02:54,949 --> 00:03:02,089
got here he founded the synapses Club in

44
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:05,389
1907 and then the synapses Club I feel

45
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,270
is our microevolution anything that

46
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:10,579
holds us together ok because it's the

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,500
faculty and the students and the staff

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,860
did everything together

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,709
work together and so we have a synapses

50
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:25,760
right of all the groups and and that's

51
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:26,479
what I I love about Adam so glad so and

52
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,909
it was Webber

53
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,238
so think about Webber when you have a

54
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:36,019
synapse Club meeting ok so who was this

55
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,330
person John and Herbert John Webber he

56
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,050
was head of the department from 1907 to

57
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:44,660
1912 and he was at the time the most

58
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:50,090
notable plant breeder and botanist in

59
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:54,139
the USA and he was their pathologist

60
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,390
from 1892 to 1899 he was in their plant

61
00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:01,298
breeding laboratory he was a

62
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:04,069
physiologist in charge and he Raska

63
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:14,209
undergraduate and a PhD at Washington

64
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:17,149
University st. Louis so and so and when

65
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,280
he came one of the things that was I

66
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:22,668
found really interesting she found this

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,349
is that in 1907 1908 when he came it was

68
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:29,719
the department was called the department

69
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,020
of experiment and then in 1908 1909 it

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
was

71
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:37,339
Department of experimental and then 1909

72
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,199
to 2004 it was Department of plant

73
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,379
breeding and then another here's my

74
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,909
macro evolutionary change 2004 to 2014

75
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:59,480
the department plant breeding genetics

76
00:04:43,910 --> 00:05:00,860
thanks to so what did

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,410
whoever do when he got here well

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:14,000
apparently Bailey's Bailey's visit was

79
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:17,620
not and Webber's so he wanted Webber

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,870
distressed research in biology biology

81
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,709
and he emphasized genetics and breeding

82
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:30,680
and whoever decided that hey you can't

83
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:34,479
do so he started this graduate education

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,069
program and he initiated research on

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,720
weed and oats and barley and potatoes

86
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:42,980
and he produced the first open

87
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,560
pollinated corn brain okay so me you

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,550
probably know me all right so here's the

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,230
first group of the synapses group with

90
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,319
synapses and faculty in the spring of

91
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:58,340
1908 and here's dr. Webber right here

92
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,610
and Bailey wanted him to work with the

93
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,669
farmers Bailey came as a

94
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,009
horticulturalist and he also was very

95
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,650
interested in form so he asked Webber to

96
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,149
start the right of bulletin so the first

97
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:15,219
bulletin that came out of our apartment

98
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:15,219
was the plant breeders for farmers

99
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:38,660
faculty directories the register the

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,399
course that Webber and apparently he was

101
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,350
an effective mentor and he trained many

102
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,709
notable graduate students the most

103
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,960
notable that we remember

104
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:50,389
is a th and this is doctor love a young

105
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,759
doctor love right here

106
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:57,959
another thing that Bailey did is he

107
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,839
really wanted a weber because bailey did

108
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:04,709
not want to continue to be d he wanted

109
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:07,109
someone else to take charge travel and

110
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:15,709
collect plants and the wallace thing so

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:18,330
um Oh doctor dr. Webber said of this

112
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,789
look you can take some trips and I'll be

113
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,159
acting so he was acting game for a while

114
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,050
and the other thing that happened during

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,740
this time is that this guy whose name is

116
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,100
Gilbert Gilbert was a teacher and at

117
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:36,689
this time you know genetics had just

118
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:39,660
been come to the forefront of Mendel's

119
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:43,589
work had just been rediscovered in 1900

120
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:47,640
and not only was genetics being applied

121
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:50,549
to plants and animals but also people

122
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,399
okay so we had something at Cornell

123
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,920
called the eugenics society and it was a

124
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,099
eugenic Society at Cold Harbor what did

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,100
I do

126
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:20,439
how do I get rid of that okay so okay so

127
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:23,139
Weber was the okay so Weber was the

128
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:30,999
person who was the advisor for the

129
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:33,158
society and I'm tired Gilbert was

130
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:40,449
Gilbert was the advisor for genetic

131
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:45,490
society and Weber but later on when the

132
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:50,198
successor to and I'll tell you about

133
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:54,370
that second okay so um Weber with Weber

134
00:08:50,198 --> 00:09:03,998
was recruited to go to the USDA in

135
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:06,879
Riverside around 1912 and he so RA

136
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:11,860
Emerson succeeded Weber but it was a

137
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:15,039
complicated story in that um Emerson had

138
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:19,050
gone to Harvard to get his sed with East

139
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:22,028
Edward Murray East in 1913 and he was

140
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,620
they did the first work on quantitative

141
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,078
genetics improved that there was more

142
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:33,578
than one gene involved in the character

143
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:34,948
and so whoever really wanted and the

144
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:39,359
reason they could make a recommendation

145
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:43,328
was because whoever was his brother and

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,990
he so fortunately I would marry east

147
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:51,909
knew that he writes to him and he says

148
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:54,579
listen I'll do it you know I'll say that

149
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:56,528
this is the best geneticist

150
00:09:54,578 --> 00:10:00,808
he's the best medicines in the country

151
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:06,269
and you should get him to be the new

152
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:06,269
chairman and so fortunately Bailey and

153
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,599
and so they brought Emerson here so ever

154
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,599
seen

155
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,950
one of his major contributions that we

156
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,629
probably all remember is that Emerson

157
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,750
and his students established the school

158
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:31,088
of we're now and and he began the

159
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:41,820
maisonette X corporation newsletter in

160
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:45,940
99 so it was actually 99 that the first

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,300
newsletter went out okay so what did

162
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,130
Everson do when he got here in 1914 he

163
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,990
decided and and it's a long complicated

164
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,490
story I won't go through it but he

165
00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:03,730
decided that he wanted to get rid of

166
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:05,950
Gilbert he didn't want so this picture

167
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,889
doesn't have any pictures of these two

168
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:13,509
synapses called pictures from 21 and 23

169
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,509
do not have any pictures of Gilbert but

170
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:19,778
what they do have is this guy

171
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:22,299
çb Hutchison and CP Hutchison is right

172
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:25,269
here and Emerson recruited him from

173
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:28,509
Missouri he was supposedly a fantastic

174
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,309
teacher and he brought him here he

175
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,289
didn't have a PhD at the time he said

176
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:39,069
you're gonna come I'm gonna make people

177
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:44,740
faculty member and go to work with East

178
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:47,500
and he never finishes through it they

179
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,100
got a masters and not only did he come

180
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,950
back

181
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,950
knowing about core genetics but he also

182
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,589
castle was up there doing Drosophila

183
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:07,809
said you know we can't just do reading

184
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:10,570
with plants we're gonna have and the

185
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:14,909
person who he worked with him was dr.

186
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:22,240
Frazier who took his position after a

187
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:24,799
left left he became and Emerson hired a

188
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,769
bunch of really incredible faculty

189
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:32,149
members okay go through this quickly so

190
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:35,509
in 1921 Emerson went up to the triple-s

191
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,129
meetings in Canada and Toronto and

192
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:40,039
brought back a whole slew of great

193
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,600
geneticist apartment and if you're

194
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,278
familiar with these guys you might know

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
that whoops sorry

196
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,049
this is this is bridges if he bridges a

197
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,489
Drosophila geneticist this is so right

198
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:53,990
guinea pigs this is meant to work with

199
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,329
Drosophila and this is C B Hutchison and

200
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,789
this is Bateson and Bateson was the

201
00:12:56,328 --> 00:13:03,859
person who to English so that we could

202
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:06,889
all read it so he's the first person

203
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,778
really pushed so of course Emerson

204
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:13,399
newbies Cornell and visit so they did

205
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:16,278
and that's the picture that we have and

206
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,679
this is the building that they were in

207
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:19,970
anybody recognize this building this

208
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:29,870
used to be called the Forrester building

209
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:32,600
it's for a now home okay so in in 1925

210
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,799
the synapses Club in the department had

211
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,320
their first anniversary and I'm sorry

212
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,609
nice 1932 they had the 25th anniversary

213
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:48,230
Cornell host genetics here a Mersenne

214
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,970
was a major speaker and and this is dr.

215
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,789
Morgan the Drosophila geneticist two

216
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,360
years later he would win the prize and

217
00:13:52,789 --> 00:14:01,719
here they are you know building here in

218
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:04,430
the street okay so so this is where

219
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,740
Rhodes comes in and thinks that that

220
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:09,049
this is when the first newsletter was

221
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,629
started in 1932 that's what Rhodes

222
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:15,078
rights but that's what he remembered

223
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:16,789
it's not quite okay so once they decided

224
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,309
to have this 25th anniversary of the

225
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,990
department so your picture of them this

226
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,389
is a whole bunch of people who got

227
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,139
together during this 25th anniversary of

228
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:31,039
synapses you know what building this is

229
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:33,970
1932 plant science and that's the

230
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,969
building that Harry crane

231
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:46,329
all right so that's without all the idea

232
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:52,990
and if you look at our picture in our

233
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:56,320
book there's a lot of question marks on

234
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,830
names we these were people who came back

235
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,860
for the genetics Congress and they were

236
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,259
cornelian and they all got together they

237
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,659
were probably formers they took a

238
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,100
picture we don't have the IDs we don't

239
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:10,629
know how most of the people in this

240
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,490
picture I don't know who they are

241
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,019
Murph and I went crazy trying to ID them

242
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,180
we don't know who they are but ever

243
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,740
since was a great supporter of synapses

244
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:22,829
and he went hunting for Denison so they

245
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:27,539
meals together in the synapses Club room

246
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,540
at this time the synapses Club room

247
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:38,379
when science I'll show you some pictures

248
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:40,960
okay so the other 32 that we had was all

249
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:43,750
right and in 1932 ever since gave this

250
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,150
fabulous talk on the update of of core

251
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,639
genetics and it was these wonderful site

252
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,399
of geneticists that he trained or that

253
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,490
worked with him at Cornell who were able

254
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,289
to find the linkage map genes on the

255
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,169
chromosome for McClintock was head of

256
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:03,429
this whole group working with beetle and

257
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:06,789
working with Rhodes and they did this

258
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:13,000
this living maze map down down that's

259
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:20,019
the group at everywhere unfortunately I

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,899
hate this picture go online and you look

261
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,449
at this picture it says this is a this

262
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:32,559
is Barbara McClintock as a student with

263
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:35,410
Emerson wrong ding-dang wrong 1929 dr.

264
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,019
McClintock get a PhD for two years

265
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:44,199
already okay the only student in this

266
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:47,860
picture are beetles the dog and Marcus

267
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:53,440
rose those are the only students okay

268
00:16:47,860 --> 00:17:01,659
this is dr. McClintock but if you go

269
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:17,439
online you will see what nothing is that

270
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:21,909
yes okay so okay so 1929 to 1940 the

271
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,779
Great Depression people was trying

272
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,310
really hard to get jobs for people and

273
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,470
there was reduce support for graduate

274
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,299
students you can all of this is in the

275
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,490
archives you see all these letters back

276
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:38,079
and forth what are we going to do how we

277
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:40,450
support the students meanwhile there was

278
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,939
increased activity in veg crops reading

279
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,940
quantitative emergency horn somehow they

280
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,710
this guy Rd Lewis who I'm not going to

281
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,949
talk a lot about but if you wanna know

282
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,690
more about look he moved to Ohio State

283
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,700
University great stuff out there but

284
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,039
what I do want to emphasize is this

285
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,370
Rockefeller Foundation Foundation grants

286
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,930
the may Emerson wrote to the Rockefeller

287
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:04,519
Foundation he said I really want to get

288
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,080
this today's newsletter going I really

289
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,629
want to get the seats not cooperative

290
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:16,519
going which is still going today

291
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:20,660
Rockefeller and bother McClintock had

292
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:23,690
gone to Europe in 1933 didn't stay very

293
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,029
long because the war was beginning and

294
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,230
she came back and didn't didn't know

295
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:32,450
what she was gonna do she was on a

296
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:35,599
Guggenheim and Emerson wrote this grant

297
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,309
and aid for her and got her a two-year

298
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,639
grant an aide to work as his assistant

299
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:46,009
in the plant breeding department okay so

300
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,840
she was ever since TV just great work

301
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:53,839
the thing chromosome work was started

302
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:55,970
during that okay so then we had a lot of

303
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,869
international activities going on and

304
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,850
when dr. Murphy 10 years ago we started

305
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:05,389
with the Cornell named Qing China

306
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:07,009
1924-1930 love Meijer Wiggins we said

307
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,160
that was the history of International

308
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:13,819
Programs it's not sure okay

309
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:19,640
what's true is that this guy Garrity

310
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:24,289
Brill Cornell undergraduate 1888 he was

311
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:27,650
went to China and he became the head of

312
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:33,399
a new School of Agriculture in China in

313
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:37,580
1888 and that was started but then

314
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:42,140
Cornell Nanking China 1914 to 1931 John

315
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:50,329
has Henry Reisner Reisner was a minor in

316
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:51,950
plant breeding with Gilbert but he

317
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:54,309
mighta did plant breeding with Gilbert

318
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,309
but he

319
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:03,759
our series is going to be that mr. sing

320
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:06,309
a song sorry and he's going to talk to

321
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,009
you about John Henry riser and how he

322
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:13,409
got his training at Cornell to be able

323
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:16,930
to go to Cornell and work as the Dean of

324
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,690
agriculture and when he was the Dean of

325
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:23,950
agriculture in Nanking China then he

326
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:31,710
invited back professors from Cornell to

327
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:36,059
go there and work and help them only to

328
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,059
Cornell Nanking but it goes back to

329
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,599
though

330
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,969
okay so then love also worked as an

331
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:50,619
advisor in China and went to Puerto Rico

332
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:55,180
as an advisor and that's the news okay

333
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:56,859
so dr. Emerson retired in 1942 and they

334
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,750
tried to figure out who to bring back

335
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:02,439
and dr. Murphy did not want to talk

336
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:09,369
about this succession he said but let me

337
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:11,170
tell as briefly as I could make it ever

338
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,169
since wanted Rhodes to come back and

339
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,269
head Rose wanted Mangelsdorf to come

340
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,860
with him from Harvard okay

341
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,470
so there's tons of letters in the

342
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,839
archives back and forth road saying

343
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,339
should I go back essay should come on

344
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,339
we'll work together it'll be great and

345
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:42,219
so there's a letter about that you know

346
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:43,690
I was you know and so he says no and so

347
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,390
Mangelsdorf says well if you're not

348
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:51,640
going back I mean not back but I'm going

349
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:53,259
not calling so the so story so that's

350
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,560
there and so what happens is the B

351
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:59,500
throws up his hands and says what so the

352
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:06,839
next thing you know dr. love is acting

353
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,950
here and the Dean says you know this was

354
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:13,428
dr. Meyers I think it was was the Dean

355
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,139
and he says well you know since it was

356
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,250
started you were registered you know

357
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,750
everything about that department I'm

358
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,519
gonna make you acting head let's see how

359
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:27,769
goes okay and so makes an acting head

360
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:29,298
and eventually he does so well that he

361
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:32,419
becomes the chair

362
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:34,250
alright and dr. Fraiser

363
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,380
unfortunately dies during this time

364
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,648
period he was very sick with cancer but

365
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:43,039
dr. love brings in new faculty dr.

366
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:47,619
monger dr. Cushing dr. Atwood and from

367
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,619
1942 to 1946 was happening

368
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,210
the war where the men

369
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:00,369
we were the assistants all right we've

370
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,000
got to get some women in here because

371
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:07,989
there's no men to help us in the field

372
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,019
but you know actually there were women

373
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:15,910
there were women before who did research

374
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,960
they just didn't get PhDs and why didn't

375
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,000
they catch me cheating so we're talking

376
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,090
about this prejudice this morning it's

377
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,400
because the faculty felt if they caught

378
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:32,649
if they got a student in here how to get

379
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:35,230
a job and they knew that farmers so they

380
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,700
said you know let you know you could do

381
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,960
mind you can minor in clinic reading but

382
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:47,319
why don't you major

383
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:50,100
you'll get a job okay so but by the time

384
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:54,099
the war came they had a natural

385
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:56,859
evolutionary change all right and the

386
00:23:54,099 --> 00:24:00,189
first woman graduate student was Leona

387
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:04,740
she'll 1946 year was warned she got her

388
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:08,019
PhD and then we had a Chinese student a

389
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,210
funky Fung Rosalind Morris who became a

390
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:13,869
famous plant breeder and she's been here

391
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:16,029
a couple times and Florence Thomas 1948

392
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,979
so those are the new faculty of sorry

393
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,509
the new students we came and we had some

394
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,829
people retired so there's some pictures

395
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:26,470
there and the IDS are on the book you

396
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:29,409
can get them from okay so love had a

397
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,000
vision from 1944 to 1949 he wanted the

398
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,850
expansion of the plant breeding program

399
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,099
he wanted to do more on the more pure

400
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:40,209
seed program increased research or did

401
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:43,449
he get it and he increased addition he

402
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:47,380
hired additional and this is the

403
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:51,190
synapses Club 1945 49 how many people

404
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:54,820
are there but are there any women yeah

405
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,730
there's a few women in the middlee all

406
00:24:54,819 --> 00:25:02,649
right so how about students from 1946 to

407
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:04,960
1949 work so we had assistantships from

408
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,320
the state federal government and

409
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,079
I'm cooperative we got GI support you

410
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:14,528
know so a lot of men who came back could

411
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:19,240
go to school on the GI Bill so there

412
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:21,759
were 23 Bartman and then there were

413
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:30,069
national governments who gave money and

414
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:33,819
sent foreign men men and so here the new

415
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:36,099
new plant breeding faculty dr. Jenson

416
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,629
was hired dr. Johnson was hard he's the

417
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:40,898
real tall one in the middle

418
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,850
dr. Serb came in as a geneticist not not

419
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:46,329
a plant breeder but as a geneticist and

420
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:49,719
and Serb Adrian serve was a student of

421
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:52,058
beetles beetle wanted him recommended

422
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,140
that he'd come back to Cornell

423
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:59,109
dr. Murphy here on the left dr. Smith

424
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:03,159
and dr. Federer so he dr. Federer

425
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:04,178
wonderful biometry and dr. love also did

426
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,789
a lot of biopsy

427
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,190
so those are the six new faculty members

428
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:15,220
so that's another one of these what I

429
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:23,950
would correlate a macroevolutionary dr.

430
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:25,778
Murphy's here's a picture that dr.

431
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,159
Murphy called loves post-world War two

432
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:32,648
transformations dr. love was about to

433
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,270
some sort dr. love was about to retire

434
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:40,989
here and he the way dr. Murphy told me

435
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:43,690
this story dr. love decided to call dr.

436
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,849
Bailey and say look you started this

437
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,440
department I want you to come and meet

438
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:52,000
all these young people who are doing

439
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,429
fabulous work and I'm going to take you

440
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,700
out in the field and and show you all

441
00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:00,220
their research and Bailey said okay so I

442
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,840
don't know who took the but I just think

443
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,000
this is a fabulous picture of all these

444
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,308
young people and dr. Bailey in the

445
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,250
middle and here's dr. Levin here's dr.

446
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:11,589
Murphy and so dr. Murphy tells the story

447
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,970
that when they wanted to get the course

448
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,308
to go out into the field

449
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,819
he asked everybody what are you working

450
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:21,960
on and people hold up and then

451
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:30,928
first I'm gonna ride now it's one of my

452
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:34,139
first projects I love to okay so so up

453
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:36,450
until 1949 danlove retired and this is

454
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:38,428
just a summer I called the summer

455
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,950
summary slide doctor blood became head

456
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,499
in 44 following World War two he said

457
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,759
the department in a new direction Atwood

458
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:49,589
and Murphy were hired by my love and

459
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,298
they hired young faculty and then dr.

460
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:54,538
Murphy used to say all plant breeding

461
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:58,138
faculty members were leaders I had to

462
00:27:54,538 --> 00:28:00,239
show you okay so here's the average of

463
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,308
Murphy years now at work dr. Murphy was

464
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:04,348
very very much really was he talked a

465
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:05,878
lot but he was very very mops and he

466
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:08,638
didn't really want to say everything

467
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:10,259
that you know he did and so he all he

468
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:12,209
said is let me put out when Murphy

469
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,489
together and tell you about what we did

470
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,919
together and he said that they filed

471
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:20,579
loves vision they hire new faculty dr.

472
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,038
ever came along study porn dr. LOH dr.

473
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:25,618
Steele dr. York the Cornell low spaniels

474
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:32,278
project in the Philippines got underway

475
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:34,108
in 1952 because war and I'm not going to

476
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,470
go through that because dr. Turk wrote

477
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:40,949
this law spaniel story online and read

478
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,079
it in 1974 Atwood was appointed the Dean

479
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,659
of the graduate school in 1953 and then

480
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,089
the provost so another again major

481
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:50,070
change happening here a macro

482
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:51,509
evolutionary change and dr. Morgan

483
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:55,589
Murphy was appointed the head of the

484
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:58,979
department for now many of you remember

485
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:04,848
dr. Murphy as the head of department and

486
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:09,058
he did which is all most of our history

487
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:11,608
the 50th anniversary of synapses was 97

488
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:15,658
and he decided during this time that

489
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:18,439
they should have another 25 and so they

490
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:23,909
did and they fought back speakers and

491
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,080
the symposium presentation it's all the

492
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:29,720
former students and what they talked

493
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:31,819
about is in our history what happened

494
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,339
his time period some major changes

495
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,990
actually the first three things listed

496
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,549
there remodeling the facilities in the

497
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,120
plant breeding garden shed and Cordwell

498
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:42,649
field house we're done by atwood

499
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:45,529
according to what dr. Murphy told me

500
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,240
plant science building spaces we weren't

501
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:51,859
in this building yet right we weren't as

502
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,259
build until 1968 the dr. Murphy build

503
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,939
temporary plastic greenhouses lab houses

504
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,069
and cold frames because we were running

505
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,170
out of space to do this stuff so that's

506
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:05,829
what Murphy's contribution was a major

507
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,830
thing and he felt that the cooperation

508
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:12,409
contribution okay so plan for a degree

509
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:18,500
search has a picture of first

510
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:21,620
pollinating pictures of Murphy

511
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:25,369
pollinating his alfalfa so we've got

512
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:27,679
during this time from 50 54 to 60 4 we

513
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:30,019
have improved varieties wheat hybrid

514
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,150
corn oats barley alfalfa brasses

515
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:35,240
tomatoes beans I mean we were going

516
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,190
crazy stuff and if you want a list of

517
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,259
all the things that's why I was able to

518
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,539
do this Jeff it's in the book it's he

519
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,299
compiled all this see all the new

520
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:47,389
varieties that we we put together and

521
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:50,710
put out the genetics research

522
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,330
biochemical genetics was becoming

523
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,360
prominent radiation and chemical

524
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:57,859
mutagenesis quantitative inheritance

525
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,979
corn seed stocks the maize newsletter

526
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:02,419
was trans because people here weren't

527
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,809
going to take care of it anymore we lost

528
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:08,420
the grant and who was that Illinois

529
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:11,990
roads so he took care of it with who

530
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:15,680
Jeff Ellen Dempsey they did the maze

531
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,720
newsletter in Illinois okay the pure C

532
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,720
program cooperation efforts with various

533
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,910
Cornell departments lots of operation I

534
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,630
mean Emerson believe in cooperation and

535
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:29,480
that's that was the way to go okay and

536
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,920
of course everybody we follow that

537
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,250
tradition here we liked to have

538
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,670
cooperation amongst ourselves the

539
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,950
student funding from 46 to 64 from what

540
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,570
Murphy said was where he found this

541
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,590
information the federal state

542
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:50,428
had funding federal grants USDA

543
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:54,259
glf farm crops 192 student majors during

544
00:31:50,429 --> 00:32:00,509
this time 329 minor students bought a

545
00:31:54,259 --> 00:32:02,278
whole bunch of binary okay more new

546
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,950
faculty plan free these are people that

547
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,749
dr. Murphy hired plant breeding the

548
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,129
first woman everybody thinks that Lisa

549
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:18,569
was the first woman in plant breeding

550
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:19,459
know so who is the first woman in plant

551
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,470
breeding

552
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:26,249
this is Margaret Emmer Ling

553
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:30,470
where did she come from the University

554
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:35,429
of Missouri who did she do her PhD with

555
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:37,679
l.j Stadler LJ Stadler was the person

556
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:40,379
who hired Barbara McClintock and gave

557
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,489
her her first assistant professorship at

558
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:46,589
Missouri and Stadler so Margaret

559
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:56,669
levelling and and ever and dr. Murphy

560
00:32:46,589 --> 00:33:00,079
told me that it wasn't okay so that was

561
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:03,509
1958 the other person who was new and a

562
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,928
Drosophila geneticist was hired in this

563
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:05,929
department

564
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,819
anyway know who that is

565
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:12,298
Bruce Wallace standing next to dr.

566
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:14,788
Murphy

567
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:17,069
Bruce Wallace came in 1958 from Cold

568
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:19,950
Spring Harbor working at Cold Spring

569
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:21,058
Harbor and Merck said you know we're

570
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:26,850
gonna get it yourself would you notice

571
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:31,259
it doesn't matter that we're gonna get

572
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:33,748
the best person dr. Wallace came whose

573
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:39,269
walls came the other person that was new

574
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:42,720
was Harry Stinson he came in 62 6260 3

575
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:44,429
in genetics as a geneticist they hired

576
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,038
him down from the agricultural research

577
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:52,288
station in Connecticut so we have a lot

578
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,788
of new faculty and you know everybody's

579
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:55,210
identified in the book I'm not gonna I'm

580
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:57,849
not going to go through the IDs

581
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,380

with that part he said okay I can't

587
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,480
write about the history of so I don't

588
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,519
know what what we're gonna do and I said

589
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,789
well here's what we're gonna do we hear

590
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,440
that living the living faculty people

591
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:34,719
who are who were department chairs

592
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,300
during this time period up to 19 up to

593
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:41,108
2007 there was dr. place dead right and

594
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,000
William party

595
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:44,918
Ronnie Kaufman Elizabeth Earle Ronnie

596
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,260
Kaufman began and Mark Searles he was

597
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,509
the new chair and there's the bell that

598
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,520
they you know like in rotary you do the

599
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:56,020
gavel pass the gavel and plant breeding

600
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:59,108
we passed the Bell okay and Mark at the

601
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:03,639
time how was the new chair of plant

602
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:07,929
breeding 2007 and we had our Centennial

603
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,389
okay so I said look we'll just ask the

604
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:13,659
chairs could you just please write one

605
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:17,670
page just one page what did you do and I

606
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:17,670
said to dr. Murphy they start writing

607
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,050
each group so I'm gonna quickly very

608
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:28,149
quickly go through what these people did

609
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,789
so on to dr. place dad we had the

610
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:34,030
Cornell Los Angeles Daniels project 63

611
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:36,338
272 the geneticists who with a

612
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:40,390
geneticist Wallace

613
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:42,699
Bruce Wallace Adrian Serb and Harry

614
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:45,039
Smithson they will all join that

615
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:48,460
assistant plant breeding at this point

616
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,070
in 1964-65 it was a new division of

617
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:55,449
Biological Sciences that was established

618
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:58,539
in the College of Agriculture and this

619
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,699
new division had sections section that

620
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:03,239
the geneticist went to was called the

621
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:04,960
section of genetics development and

622
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:10,389
physiology

623
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:13,329
that's where I got my degree okay so all

624
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:15,250
the geneticists left or the pure

625
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:17,589
geneticists not the plant breeding they

626
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,550
applied they went over to the division

627
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:21,670
of Biological Sciences

628
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,619
that's why putting in italics the McLin

629
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,400
McClintock came as an Ag white professor

630
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:29,050
at large in 1965 in this new section

631
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,420
okay and that's how I got to meet her

632
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:37,119
because fortunately her appointment was

633
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:39,280
re3 scheduled and so it was a 6-year

634
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,230
appointment and then they renewed it so

635
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,260
in 1971 when I came as a graduate

636
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,260
student

637
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:49,839
okay plant breeding moved to Bradfield

638
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,970
hall in nineteen that's when we got here

639
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:57,549
okay biometry became a semi autonomous

640
00:36:53,969 --> 00:37:02,318
and plant breeding they just took a

641
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:06,670
leading role in during this time 64 to

642
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:08,858
79 okay under dr. place there we got 10

643
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,680
new faculty the second woman was

644
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:14,108
appointed yay Lisa Earle was appointed

645
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:17,108
three retirements faculty awards to love

646
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:19,719
monger Jensen and Wallace and to named

647
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:23,348
chairs to LH Bailey chairs okay

648
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:26,048
William Pardee 79 to 87 for new faculty

649
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:28,269
another woman was hired the 75th

650
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:32,559
synapsis reunion took place here on

651
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:38,079
campus in 1982 many of you may have all

652
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:40,420

656
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:54,760
right in it was a program called the

657
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,798
Golden Age of corn genetics that all of

658
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,190
these great plant plant breeders and

659
00:37:56,798 --> 00:38:01,269
geneticists came back to talk and here's

660
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,490
Marcus Rhodes

661

00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:10,449
George Sprague and Harold Perry they all

664
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,369
gave talks and we recorded it and if you

665

can hear their presentations

668
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,940
Kaufmann became 87 to 93 he hired

669
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,950
another woman two new faculty one

670

retired we had an ad white visiting

671
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:31,789
professor Swaminathan the first fax

672
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:40,410
Ronnie he had the first email set up in

673
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,670
the planning department but college

674
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:43,879
didn't want to do it so they did it

675
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,880
themselves

676
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:55,740
everything was relinquished and so

677
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,960
Ronnie set up a North Campus irrigation

678
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,339
for experimental fields those his he

679
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,550
felt with him some of his major

680
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,710
accomplishments dr. Earl two new faculty

681
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,200
another woman she hired and during this

682
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:12,809
time three women it was increasing

683
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,460
emphasis on genomics we had she's able

684
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,739
to figure out how to get funding for

685
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,659
graduate students very inventive I'm not

686
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:21,389
going to go through all that and then we

687
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:25,889
had two faculty awards dr. Tanksley dr.

688
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:29,659
von Humboldt award and dr. so this

689
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:32,190
department had major contributions

690
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,859
Ronnie came back again we called the

691
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:37,559
Ronnie reprise I hold it

692
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,360
what new faculty member was hired and

693
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:46,980
the faculty are all tell you all I hear

694
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:50,370
oops sorry here's dr. Murphy with dr.

695
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,840
Borlaug he was a visiting professor here

696
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,089
so that's a picture from that time

697
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:59,010
during this time we had the department

698
00:39:54,090 --> 00:40:01,050
of genetics and plant breeding the the

699
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,690
I'm sorry department of genetics and

700
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:06,539
plant breeding was the new name that's

701
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:11,519
on Durrani okay so we now not know no

702
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:17,210
longer Department 2004 genetics got

703
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:17,210
added back it was it was always genetics

704
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,730
experimental plant breeding and plant

705
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:28,940
breeding so you it was planned really in

706
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,940
biology

707
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,500
the College of Agriculture had its

708
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,269
centennial in 2004 here's dr. murphy and

709
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:48,010
i holding a palm leaf over our heads and

710
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:51,599
wearing Centennial buttons okay so and

711
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,600
then Ronnie put up a modern seat

712
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:06,460
okay graduate students in Cornell plant

713
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:12,280
up until 2007 we had uh 801 degrees had

714
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:14,619
been awarded students 307 masters 494

715
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,380
doctorates and students from 70

716
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:19,359
different nations

717
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,789
okay and then we published the book our

718
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,590
book right here and here's dr. I love

719
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:24,820
this picture ground traffic on the

720
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:30,010
tractor I just have to get some more

721
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:31,780
pictures of Murphy okay um now this was

722
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,830
something that I had to try to do

723
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:39,250
because of the digital Dark Age we have

724
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:41,679
Luke we're losing or history and we

725
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,929
don't have stuff being printed and put

726
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,210
into files anymore right so you have to

727
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:51,730
try to find where is all this stuff that

728
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:56,230
happened since 2007 and during the time

729
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:58,119
that mark was chair from 2007 to 2014 he

730
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,940
was the last year of plant breeding and

731
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,940
genetics we had our centennial

732
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:09,030
celebration all new office staff except

733
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:11,349
for there had been here longer than okay

734
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,210
Judy singer Judy sink was here long

735
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:15,670
longer than mark but we had all new

736
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,800
folks you know what that meant all the

737
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:20,309
computers got upgraded and all the

738
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,310
history of

739
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:27,380
sorry we were rate the number one breed

740
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:32,110
plant breeding doctoral program in the

741
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:34,309
nation by the National Research Chair

742
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,140
there was transition at the field staff

743
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:41,529
we expanded the collaborations with

744
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:43,929
Cornell's in international program and

745
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:47,720
there was acquisition of innovation

746
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:49,219
which we just had lunch in that room the

747
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:57,409
largest number of graduate students

748
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:59,269
since 1978 when Mark stepped down okay

749
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,679
they said this is just all the faculty

750
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:02,360
honors I guess I don't have time really

751
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,609
to read this to you but there was a lot

752
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,120
of faculty honors one of the things I

753
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:11,059
want to point out as Susan Susan became

754
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,679
professor Jeff Doyle got the got them

755
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:17,929
got a merit award from the Botanical

756
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:20,589
Society and let's see there was a world

757
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:24,319
agricultural price the Kauffman

758
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:26,450
Chancellor's award to the couch women in

759
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,460

760
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:29,869
science mentoring award to Ronnie I mean

761
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,849
all these great things happen during

762
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:37,069
this time period the synapses Clint I

763
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:39,049
think I got the wrong date on this okay

764
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,800
I'll fix that and then here's Martin

765
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:45,260
okay so that's the end after a hundred

766
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,090
and seven years the department became a

767
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,760
section in the new school of Integrative

768
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:52,820
plant science and Jeff became the

769
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,460
section chair twisting and turning his

770
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:58,430
hands arms to do it is from what I've

771
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:06,710
learned I asked him for some pictures of

772
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:09,289
himself and he gave me some so plant

773
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,880
breeding and genetics 2014 faculty

774

YouTube okay now here's my epilogue

787
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:10,529
digital Dark Age that usually last year

788
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,118
wasn't this year was two years ago Vince

789
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,349
Cerf a Google vice president and father

790
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,789
of the internet predicted that all

791
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,700
images and documents now saved on

792
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:19,349
computers will eventually be lost he

793
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:21,179
predicts the 21st century will be a

794
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,250
digital Dark Age current computer

795
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,559
documents risk being lost in the wake of

796
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:29,489
accelerated digital evolution unless a

797
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:32,900
solution is digital found to dis I have

798
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:36,179
I'm begging you I am begging you please

799
00:45:32,900 --> 00:46:32,730
any time something great happens send me

800
00:45:36,179 --> 00:46:36,358
an email if she wants to he said he

801
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:38,608
wanted to wanted to he was hoping that

802
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,529
the new president of the of the college

803
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:42,529
could you

804
00:46:42,849 --> 00:47:11,469
but you know picture from around the

805
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:13,630
1932 you do have the ID you know all

806
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:52,029
those people in the big picture do you

807
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:56,980
know the big picture original prints

808
00:47:52,030 --> 00:48:26,500
from 30 to Congress that came out of no

809
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:35,110
idea how you know I first became aware

810
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:43,059
of this around 2000 and the National

811
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:46,599
Archives because the archivist they just

812
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:49,960
come so he called the meeting and nobody

813
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:54,219
else we want remember there was a guy

814
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:57,150
there from Germany the National Archives

815
00:48:54,219 --> 00:49:04,719
and each said more is known about
