1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,970
University well good afternoon it's a

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,949
pleasure to be here every time I talk

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,070
about my mom and my dad I make sure that

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,108
my mom gets first place because in an ad

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,260
she said I was mentioned first and my

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,039
name was in bold so even though she's

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,650
passed today's seminar is going to be a

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,800
little bit different not a lot of data

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,390
but hopefully an idea of because I don't

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,279
think a lot of you then become Apple

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,679
breeders but a little bit of the

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,160
fascination that we find working in this

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:41,729
crap and working in any crop from a

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,878
horticultural or breeding perspective so

16
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,709
I'm very blessed and today I am NOT

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,599
going to be able to acknowledge everyone

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,509
that's been a part of this it really

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,120
does take a village and I've benefited

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:58,710
from my predecessors dr. Roger way and

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,019
Bob lamb when I came in 1985 I knew very

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,420
little about apples I knew enough to be

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,000
dangerous and they graciously

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,969
let me be the expert and not only that

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
they welcomed me into their home and I

26
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,118
hope that I can be as gracious when I

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,140
retire but despite rumors not happening

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,430
for a while okay I'm going to

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,810
acknowledge in the front in the back

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,240
because I know I'm going to forget

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,280
people so first and foremost have been

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,199
blessed to have an amazing research

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,368
support specialist in kevin maloney

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,978
and also David Terry before Kevin many

35
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,868
colleagues past and present in

36
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:41,280
horticulture entomology Plant Pathology

37
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:43,938
food science boys Thompson Thompson USDA

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,469
we have an amazing farm and field crew

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:51,179
we couldn't do our research without them

40
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:53,399
I have 73 plus acres 33 acres of

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,070
seedlings and we have to take care of

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,649
all of them amazing students including

43
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,929
some in the room and Summer Scholars and

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,590
we benefit greatly from Cornell

45
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,880
Cooperative Extension so today's talk as

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,909
I said I'd like to give a brief overview

47
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,169
and I want to convey the fun in in

48
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,449
research and breeding

49
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,429
I am blessed because I have

50
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:19,568
one of the best jobs that I can think of

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,370
you can discover and study and there's

52
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:23,560
always questions and there's more

53
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,050
questions than there are answers and

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,729
this arena especially you're able to

55
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,330
create something that's never been

56
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:34,030
created before so you are seeing fruit

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:37,450
for the first time that no one's tasted

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,900
no one's experienced and sometimes it's

59
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:42,939
amazing and other times it's not but

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,000
either way you learn a lot about it I

61
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:49,659
got my PhD in genetics because I worked

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,479
for a very renowned plant breeder Fred

63
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,340
Huff and he showed me miles of seedlings

64
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,159
and he said see this cross it didn't

65
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,569
work and I was like what a waste

66
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,459
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna become a

67
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:04,449
geneticist and that's not going to

68
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,949
happen to me huh you can know a lot

69
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:08,619
about genetics but there's always

70
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:11,229
something that gets in the way and then

71
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,629
the other fact is apples are incredibly

72
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:16,060
diverse I could not my apologies to

73
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:19,000
those in the room I could not work on

74
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:23,259
wheat or a commodity crop I need it to

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,209
be different and apples are far from

76
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:28,599
uniform and so I'm going to share some

77
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:33,730
of that diversity also apples bring out

78
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:37,180
the fanatics so one of our showcases

79
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:39,009
used to make an apple map of New York

80
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,049
State with apples now I'm gonna have a

81
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,389
showcase a week from now we're not

82
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,840
having that but it takes a lot of work

83
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,819
the other art work is in Sweden they

84
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,009
have a festival where they put apples on

85
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:55,030
nails and they make these huge beautiful

86
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:57,009
displays we also had a researcher that

87
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,739
came and visited the repository she was

88
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,929
fascinated with the apples and she said

89
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,370
I'd like to see other diversity and I

90
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,760
took her out to see some of our

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,799
architectural mutants and she fell in

92
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,459
love and she did a photo shoot now only

93
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,129
an LA photo expert can come and she said

94
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:19,000
can we bring snow machines if there's

95
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,430
not smell word upstate New York pretty

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,149
sure there's gonna be snow there wasn't

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,009
okay so I'm doing this for a colleague

98
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:29,769
that I hope is in Geneva

99
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:32,649
but apples are extremely popular so we

100
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:36,909
got a lot of requests and you know that

101
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:38,859
they are not enjoying the cabbage so we

102
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,439
are lucky to have something that gets

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,280
general interest and I just ticked off

104
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,540
half of the researchers but you'll get

105
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,349
used to me

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,550
so Apple doesn't have we get into a lot

107
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,189
of trouble because there's not a

108
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,319
consensus where there's a fight over the

109
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:57,730
progenitors so you know you're in

110
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,490
trouble when you can't even agree on a

111
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,500
name for cultivated Apple or it's also

112
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,509
incredibly diverse so we have triploids

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,100
tetraploid a bit mix we have 25 to 34

114
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,199
species and we haven't tapped the

115
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,510
surface of those we have an

116
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,459
incompatibility system and we have in

117
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,399
breeding depression so that means when I

118
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:20,409
want to incorporate a gene I have to

119
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,139
back cross it to something different and

120
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,360
then the plus is that it's clonally

121
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:30,189
propagated so when I find something I

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,710
can fix it now one thing that I learned

123
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:34,180
and would be helpful any of you students

124
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,639
if you can take a course on

125
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,150
communicating science to lay audiences

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,029
I'd strongly recommend it because one of

127
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:47,019
the best examples how many of you have

128
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:49,509
read the botany of desire okay that book

129
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,879
brought the attention to the germ plasm

130
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,849
collection because it was written in a

131
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,189
way that people resonated with people we

132
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,580
had people come on motorcycle across

133
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:02,230
country to see the Kazakh forests and I

134
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,889
was like don't you think you would have

135
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,350
called ahead to see if that's allowed

136
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,659
but it showed the power of writing

137
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:15,040
something from a lay perspective and

138
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:18,280
that is what were we're trying to do in

139
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,610
communication so I'm very fortunate that

140
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,759
the USDA repository has over 2,000 for

141
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,770
3,000 selections that I can use so the

142
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,930
government pays for them which is an

143
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:31,149
example of government funding that I

144
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,689
really like I don't have to pay for it

145
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:37,359
then and dr. agon yunjeong and dr.

146
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,219
thomas chow are involved and I also have

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,879
a graduate student that is in the

148
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,400
pathways program so he

149
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,680
a PhD with me and ganya Juan and then

150
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,319
will go on to work at the repository and

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,319
more about him later

152
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,269
when I came and started an Apple in 1994

153
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,449
this was the list of genes that we knew

154
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:59,060
you do a Google search now on Apple

155
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,939
jeans and you just blown away many of

156
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,569
which were reported by people like

157
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:07,910
LaLanne and Greg and others that you

158
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:12,349
know we're starting to understand this

159
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:15,320
so we've come an amazingly long way one

160
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,330
of the breakthroughs was the publishing

161
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,399
of the Apple genome from Golden

162
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:22,279
Delicious there's fifty four thousand

163
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,379
genes more than a chicken how's that for

164
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,579
you I'm gonna let you win the gibbering

165
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:32,000
Jeopardy category for apples and this

166
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:35,209
really helped us in terms of discovering

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,490
new genes and then recently dr. face lab

168
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:42,379
at BTW i followed and resequenced many

169
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,470
things to look at the history of apple

170
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,779
and how the evolution of fruit sized

171
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,020
happened so if you get a chance to read

172
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:53,509
this paper it strongly recommend it now

173
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,949
a lot of breeders especially when they

174
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,719
start out aren't going to do any

175
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,219
specific hybrids because they're going

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,040
to do a cross and they want to get a

177
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,660
variety they don't want to go back that

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,390
far and work with something that's very

179
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,939
small but when we started doing some

180
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,250
interspecific hybrids to actually to

181
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,949
work on been our Cheska's progeny we

182
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,860
found that a normal apple seedling just

183
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,920
grows like a stick when you use an inner

184
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,580
specific hybrid we got 21 laterals which

185
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,000
we don't see and we also get small

186
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:28,159
laterals also so the green house crew

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,829
were going by and they said talk about

188
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,330
hybrid vigor and so if you could see it

189
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:35,449
we had trees that were growing like

190
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,690
vines and this shows the great potential

191
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,729
that we have if we if we want to tap it

192
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,729
I'm a member of Rose breed which is

193
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:47,690
marker-assisted breeding it's a scri

194
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:49,670
similar to Bruce's Vitus Jen we were all

195
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,650
the the three major apple breeding

196
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,719
programs Minnesota Washington in New

197
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,559
York were all in the room and a grower

198
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,840
commented

199
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,319
if a bomb blew out there goes Apple

200
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,470
breeding in the US so you know unlike

201
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,740
areas like Japan where there's 21 Jeff

202
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,210
Apple breeders we we used to have an

203
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,089
Apple breeding program for every state

204
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:13,009
that probably wasn't necessary but now

205
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,080
fortunately we're all good friends and

206
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,259
we share germ plasm when we share the

207
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,810
data so that we can get more markers and

208
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:25,009
we have a great advisory panel with the

209
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:29,179
industry so first and foremost apples

210
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,889
need to satisfy consumers and so we know

211
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:33,799
with consumers the most important

212
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:38,000
attributes are Crispus crunch texture

213
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:40,039
flavor flavor being a little bit less

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,528
important juiciness sugar and acid

215
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,599
however they have to be consistent

216
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:46,939
because when you eat a bad apple you

217
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,740
remember it's worse than it was and when

218
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,020
you eat a good apple you remember it as

219
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,990
better than it was so you're kind of

220
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,480
stuck because you're saying hmm this

221
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,089
isn't as good as the last one or I think

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,509
I'm switching to bananas so we need to

223
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,330
make sure that we keep on having them be

224
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:08,088
consistent whether they're grown in

225
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:10,370
Washington Germany or here and we're

226
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,670
identifying markers to help us with that

227
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,830
consistency so as Don said were one of

228
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:19,009
the oldest programs one of the largest

229
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,720
programs we've named 66 varieties we

230
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,929
integrate breeding genetics and genomics

231
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
we are very much multidisciplinary as I

232
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:29,419
said I can't acknowledge half the people

233
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,490
that we benefited from and Cornell

234
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:35,509
Cooperative Extension is key to getting

235
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:38,750
our information out so we do controlled

236
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:41,240
hybridization and this is a great job

237
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,279
for graduate students right then taking

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,620
our pollen is a lovely thing to do while

239
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
you watch TV

240
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,580
so we take a lot of pollen out every

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,379
year we have to get to the blossoms

242
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,589
before bees do because they're going to

243
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,600
bring unwanted pollen and I learned and

244
00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:00,260
anybody that's heard me lecture before I

245
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,750
got in trouble because my my new husband

246
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,149
at the time and I went out and I had

247
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,070
been working in the field all day and I

248
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,189
said said you look really tired I said

249
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,069
yeah I've been a mask

250
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:18,209
all day and he said please don't say

251
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:20,849
that so we make crosses and then this is

252
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:23,039
the beauty of it anybody has that has

253
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,370
kids you know the diversity that you see

254
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,620
but I get to have kids thousands of them

255
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,948
and if I don't like a particular mother

256
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,709
I can make her a father and I can I can

257
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:37,469
create promiscuity in the orchard and

258
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:39,649
just go wild with different combinations

259
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,689
and it's it's fun

260
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,278
so crosses and Families I hate the

261
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:47,519
Triscuit commercial where the lady says

262
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,610
she's not genetically modified so we

263
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,589
know were proponents of biotechnology

264
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,778
but we also get grief about our new

265
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,939
varieties about frankenfood so yes our

266
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:59,338
apples have been genetically modified

267
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:01,519
but they are not genetically modified

268
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,920
organisms so they don't have genes

269
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:09,360
outside of Apple so I give the example

270
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:11,278
of my children you want you picked your

271
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,560
parents and you want the offspring to be

272
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,068
different and you want the offspring to

273
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:19,318
be better and with children you

274
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:21,028
sometimes get that and sometimes you

275
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:24,240
don't we got double doses of

276
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:26,730
stubbornness of these two but the apple

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,799
progenies you're looking you don't want

278
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,430
them to be the same and because Apple is

279
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,559
so diverse that makes it easier so then

280
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:38,278
as I said you find something promising

281
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,318
and the sad part is sometimes you'll see

282
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,539
a seedling and that has two fruits and

283
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:44,610
Kevin and I will eat it oh my god those

284
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:48,659
are amazing and then you have to wait a

285
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,818
year and hope that it fruits again but

286
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:54,600
sometimes you'll find a very promising

287
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:57,208
seedling and then we clonally propagate

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,659
by budding so we take a bud from that

289
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:02,159
tree we can make hundreds of copies

290
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,778
we're fortunate at Geneva to have

291
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,629
somebody that works in the bottom part

292
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,000
of the plant the rootstock genera fazio

293
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:13,289
he gets as excited about the root system

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,389
as I do about the top and I really think

295
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,308
that we need to start looking at the

296
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:19,649
interaction between stop and sighin

297
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:21,509
because there's so much that could be

298
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,519
learned about that

299
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,619
so Cornell varieties that were best

300
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,230
known for Cortland is now an heirloom

301
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:32,339
being over a hundred years old McCowan's

302
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,489
getting close Empire and Jonagold and I

303
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,009
knew we were onto something when we were

304
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:40,709
asked to go to New York farm day in the

305
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,110
Senate and shall my student at the time

306
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:45,988
went with me and we're showing ample

307
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,619
samples and we were competing against

308
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:52,079
fresh oysters and wine and you know hors

309
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:55,259
d'oeuvres and were like oh this could be

310
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,508
a long night and a staffer came over and

311
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,889
she ate this Apple and she screamed get

312
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,278
out of here and she starts calling

313
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:04,019
staffers over to try these apples and

314
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,328
we're like okay well this is this is

315
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,209
looking promising and those are one of

316
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:11,659
them was Snapdragon little industry

317
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:14,518
overview if you don't know it we have

318
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:17,458
674 app growers we're second in the

319
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,739
nation McIntosh is still our number one

320
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,138
variety and then our growers were

321
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:24,449
finding they couldn't get access to a

322
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:29,129
lot of the club varieties like pink lady

323
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:30,988
or jazz or Pacific rose so we knew that

324
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:32,819
with Snapdragon and Ruby frost we had

325
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:35,639
two apples that were good enough to be

326
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:37,649
clubs but we needed an organization to

327
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,709
foster it we didn't want to give it to

328
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,048
one grower so we were looking for an

329
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:45,568
organization that didn't exist and this

330
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:48,058
is where I think my industry because all

331
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:50,759
these men and women have full-time jobs

332
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:55,350
producing apples packing apples studying

333
00:14:50,759 --> 00:15:00,149
them thank you yes

334
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:03,329
so club means that it's it's managed so

335
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,850
a certain number of growers can join in

336
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:09,028
our case it was every grower in New York

337
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:12,089
had the opportunity we met we spend

338
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:15,298
money in marketing we set quality

339
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:18,839
standards and it is both patented and

340
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:21,688
trademarked and then anybody else has to

341
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,519
be sublicensed so there were clubs that

342
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,889
picked and choose so a brother might

343
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,578
have he might be a member of a club at

344
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:31,740
his neighboring farm brother was not so

345
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,019
we needed a new organization we needed

346
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,119
to move the varieties forward

347
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,519
higher and honorable took forever can

348
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:41,249
take 40 years before a variety becomes

349
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,899
popular at because the growers not going

350
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,670
to take the chance and growing a lot of

351
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,129
this variety unless he knows it has a

352
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:50,428
home and we needed dollars for marketing

353
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:53,639
a promotion so Hooker was the

354
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:57,360
Commissioner of a got the time and other

355
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,759
breeding programs have sold to in one

356
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,938
state they sold to a competitor state

357
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,459
particular fruit variety that didn't go

358
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:07,469
over well and surpass Booker said it's

359
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,298
gonna be a long walk to the governor's

360
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,459
office if you sound this to another

361
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:13,230
state so we told the growers we were

362
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,328
interested in doing it but they had to

363
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,548
offer to everybody we were going to be

364
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,888
equal partners and risks and rewards so

365
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:25,198
this is the core group that started it

366
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:29,489
and that was a nice day after about two

367
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,958
years of negotiations with IP so for

368
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,209
commercialization they committed to

369
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,188
plant nine hundred acres so that's gonna

370
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,828
give grocery stores enough volume that's

371
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,498
about 60 percent Snapdragon and 40

372
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:42,028
percent ruby for us they were going to

373
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:47,339
market and it was going to be in retail

374
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:49,528
stores stands in 2013 and in stores 2014

375
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,079
the reason we wanted stands is that

376
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:54,629
Honey Crisp was never marketed and it

377
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,789
certainly is a success but it was

378
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:59,369
because retail stands people got to try

379
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:02,428
it they got excited and so we wanted to

380
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:05,610
have that interface for consumers so New

381
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:09,000
York Snapdragon is a cross of Honey

382
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:11,788
Crisp buy a Apple that's very similar to

383
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,528
JA to gold so what I wanted is I like

384
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:16,288
Honey Crisp but I wanted more flavor

385
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:21,359
I wanted less of the disorders that it

386
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:23,970
had we tried this was the first tray in

387
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,469
the row and I told kevin maloney we

388
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,048
can't pick the first tree in the row

389
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,389
because our stomachs aren't you know

390
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,038
somewhere yeah so we went back and we

391
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:34,709
looked at it and it was like this is

392
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,720
pretty amazing and some growers signed

393
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,669
on to grow Snapdragon without ever

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,548
having tasted it but they saw pictures

395
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:44,470
of the productivity and they had faith

396
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:47,408
in the Geneva program

397
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,839
so Ruby frost was actually a study that

398
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,759
I'll show later that a graduate student

399
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,908
did I wanted to look at the genetics of

400
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:58,210
vitamin C increasing vitamin C and I

401
00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:00,639
wanted to create reduced browning after

402
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,940
you cut them and so Ruby frost is a

403
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:06,278
hybrid of Braeburn by autumn crisp which

404
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,639
some of you might have tried at Cornell

405
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:13,480
orchards great reaction and consumer

406
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:17,349
tests and is high in vitamin C and low

407
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,308
in browning now I got to interact with

408
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:24,359
Deborah roseus class she had our growers

409
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:27,849
had the kids come up with ideas for

410
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,648
varieties now there was some if any of

411
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:32,980
you are still here I apologize there's

412
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:35,109
some really good ideas so they you were

413
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,940
so proud to be part of Cornell because

414
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:40,658
these kids some of them did it in

415
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:44,769
harmony they had you know merchandising

416
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:48,789
all set socks t-shirts one was Royal

417
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:53,319
Flush which may be a great card hand but

418
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:55,480
not a great Apple name but they did a

419
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,918
really nice job unfortunately we didn't

420
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,950
choose any of the names but it was a

421
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,830
great experience for all of them so

422
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:06,669
Chris Watkins and Yosef and Jackie maybe

423
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:09,009
I really benefited from Chris Watkins

424
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,299
and post-harvest now I told Chris he

425
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,288
said I'm not going to be here and I said

426
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:13,720
well you're not gonna hear the good

427
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:20,980
thing so that I say about you but he's

428
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:23,980
not here seriously he is great but I'm

429
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,870
once at a meeting said my apples are so

430
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,019
good I don't need a post-harvest

431
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:34,538
physiologist and Chris literally made me

432
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:39,339
eat my words so he's a Jackie and Franny

433
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:41,048
when she was here we established the

434
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:45,278
best picking dates we look at storage

435
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:46,720
disorders and we have growers sample

436
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:48,878
because they wouldn't believe that

437
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,819
certain harvests were better than other

438
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:53,408
and yosef knows how that goes so they

439
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:56,200
also learned that you don't stop at

440
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:58,240
Subway and get a 14-inch sub before

441
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,860
apple tasting because every

442
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,589
single one of these guys that Craig

443
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:05,109
photographed red and green so now they

444
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,808
know that you have to pace yourself but

445
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:09,639
it really having the industry involved

446
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:12,579
and what the best harvest date has been

447
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,420
really invaluable and I can't tell you

448
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,250
that

449
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,950
when you see your varieties in the

450
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,220
grocery store just nothing better than

451
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,500
that

452
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,120
because some breeders retire before they

453
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,859
see that now my husband was at the store

454
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:32,500
and I said what's the reaction you said

455
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:34,719
people are lining up for miles but we

456
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,279
still sell out and Helene Dillard when

457
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,679
she was here she went to the ethical

458
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,720
market and they only let her buy five

459
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:45,700
snapdragons and she said but I know the

460
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,950
breeder didn't help her so that's a

461
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,720
thing of beauty so this is going to

462
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,140
shift a little bit so any of you that

463
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,029
are working in horticultural commodities

464
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:59,140
understanding variation is key and it

465
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:01,240
can't be emphasized enough so you know

466
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,950
how to phenotype at the right stage we

467
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,630
had fights about this with rose breed

468
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,179
because they wanted to use a starch

469
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,309
iodine of eight the only thing a starch

470
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,340
iodine reading which shows maturity of

471
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:15,009
eight tells you is it's garbage and so

472
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:17,319
we had to pick it when a grower would

473
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:20,079
pick it understanding the right stage

474
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,970
minimizing variation so there can be a

475
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,980
variation to the fruit cluster the age

476
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,880
of the tree the rootstock the stage of

477
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,819
development the crop load and so by

478
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,670
computing garbage in garbage out but I

479
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:36,579
don't think you can't I can't emphasize

480
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,850
this point enough so like an apple if

481
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:42,339
you're doing a study on ethylene and you

482
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:45,339
have a king flower that's developed so

483
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:47,649
king dominant and laterals if you're

484
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:49,779
only picking the king fruit what's

485
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,030
happening when you're plucking that

486
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,379
apple off you're creating the wound and

487
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:56,619
you're creating ethylene

488
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,450
you're also having problems with you

489
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:01,989
know do you choose to look at the kid

490
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,150
where the laterals so understanding that

491
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,490
is important

492
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,110
sample size never enough never big

493
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,138
enough when you see somebody that looked

494
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:13,898
at five apples from a tree

495
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:16,388
that's not going to do it and apples as

496
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:18,308
I said are very variable the

497
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:20,168
developmental stage and what's happening

498
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:23,288
with ethylene so we have soutien got

499
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:26,049
here who's an expert on ethylene and we

500
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:27,940
need to make sure we understand what is

501
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:31,538
the stage that we're looking at is that

502
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,249
the best stage to be looking at now I

503
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:35,378
was switched to architecture a little

504
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:37,778
Bill Miller said don't let him down in

505
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:39,908
the seminar and even with columnar so

506
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:42,460
there's my mandatory columnar so

507
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:44,769
columnar is a dominant gene and weaping

508
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:52,569
as a dominant gene so what happens when

509
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:54,489
you cross them it is so you get they

510
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,200
fight it out so you get plumbing on the

511
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,999
top weeping on the bottom you got some

512
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,179
weeping you get everything in between

513
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:03,249
and it's just fun yeah I mean you just

514
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,609
get to go out there and and see this and

515
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:08,048
say you know Alan Alexa said that tree

516
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:11,918
is a tree that doesn't know what it

517
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:13,569
wants to be when it grows up now we know

518
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,909
that plant architecture branches should

519
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:19,479
go horizontal so we got a little carried

520
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:22,509
away not good for pruning but you can

521
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:23,319
see the variation again that's not

522
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,079
pruned

523
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,700
it's a wide branch angle it's awesome

524
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:33,519
mutation so unfortunately doesn't fruit

525
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:37,690
but you could have apples spokes of a

526
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:40,388
wheel and then just crazy so that is an

527
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,548
apple tree and I can bet money for

528
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:45,579
people that are like that's not an apple

529
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:47,469
tree and they even feel plastic the

530
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:52,028
flowers are like little Arabidopsis

531
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:54,778
flowers and it's just when I talk about

532
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:57,098
been we have different isomers of

533
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:59,829
compounds and some of these little leaf

534
00:23:57,098 --> 00:24:02,519
things are just wild they have things

535
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:05,288
that shouldn't be no Kano's you is

536
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,618
looking at a lot of this material he got

537
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:10,690
a grant working with prosthetic and he's

538
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:12,819
going to be publishing on we painting

539
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,120
very soon and his group has been a

540
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:18,279
really valuable collaborators

541
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,759
then you just have stuff so that tree

542
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:26,049
its sisters or 20 feet high so what

543
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:29,200
makes it have all that growth condensed

544
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:32,409
and then this cross those are sister

545
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,680
seedlings the same age but one is dwarf

546
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:38,140
and one isn't so why and that's the

547
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,590
beauty of having graduate students so

548
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,560
Showa who we benefited greatly from

549
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:47,319
Peters willingness to let us use his

550
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,259
equipment expensive equipment and offer

551
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:52,720
mentoring was able to look at

552
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:55,089
gibberellin and vegetative tissues and

553
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,210
while we haven't commercialized this

554
00:24:55,089 --> 00:25:00,209
these yet we have developed some lines

555
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,930
that are really good quality for

556
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:07,480
probably the whole market now when we do

557
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,600
a lot of mapping and genetic studies we

558
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,059
have skewed segregation and it's because

559
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,889
we have things like pale green label the

560
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:19,059
name is what it says they come out

561
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,710
yellow they die or dwarfs that most

562
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,869
people don't think they have they die

563
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,819
and so they don't know that those might

564
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:28,419
be linked with genes of interests so

565
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:30,669
been our Chesky it's always good to have

566
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,039
a graduate students that's as interested

567
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,350
in strange things as you are so he

568
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,019
started looking at columnar and he had a

569
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:41,019
side project until being lethal and he

570
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:44,769
found out that he'll gain lethal plants

571
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:48,609
were not able to to produce vitamin K

572
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:50,559
and that influences photosynthesis now

573
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:53,049
this is the beauty of Cornell I had

574
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,619
somebody contact me about arctic apple

575
00:25:53,049 --> 00:26:00,250
and I googled them and dr. Parker what

576
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:02,529
Sir Ben says it's phylloquinone ok so I

577
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,769
googled dr. Parker and dr. Parker's an

578
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:08,379
expert on vial upon ohm like hey dude

579
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:10,960
could you run some tests and see if you

580
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,650
can detect this sure enough he did and

581
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,079
is an author on one of those papers so

582
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:21,130
what's cool about this is the pale green

583
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:23,919
lethal is this tiny little guy and when

584
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,710
you put vitamin K on it it starts to

585
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,190
grow it never quite rescues the

586
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,360
phenotype

587
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:35,330
but poor been sprayed vitamin K on these

588
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,839
plants and finally he said can I stop

589
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:40,970
this is like everyday but you can see

590
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,638
the black the blue line was where he

591
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,370
stopped application and sure enough you

592
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:48,918
have the restored phenotype but then it

593
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:51,048
starts becoming chlorotic and so it was

594
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,129
a great proof of concept between the

595
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:57,440
gene and the cause now bend the chairs

596
00:26:55,128 --> 00:27:00,259
here and I had a picture of him with a

597
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,320
tomato plant and I don't hate veggies

598
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:05,990
but I wanted to have a picture of him

599
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,980
with apple trees well he brought in this

600
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:12,440
baby to see me this past weekend now I

601
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:19,069
have to ask you what has he told this

602
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:21,649
baby about his adviser but Ben is very

603
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:25,519
smart he has his defense Friday nothing

604
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:27,378
like bringing a baby and advisor so he's

605
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,538
coming the summer I'm not going to I'm

606
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:31,398
not going to steal his thunder about his

607
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:33,230
work and dihydride child homes but it's

608
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:35,569
really exciting he's given his exit

609
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,339
seminar Thursday and if you can attend

610
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:42,109
that would be wonderful

611
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:44,269
and I'll straighten it get out so sober

612
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,548
scholar it's what we are able to do is

613
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:49,220
we have a program at Geneva that for

614
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:52,038
eight weeks kids come there juniors or

615
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,089
seniors and for eight weeks they become

616
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:57,769
scientists now in eight weeks

617
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:01,128
granted we all have other stuff to do I

618
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:03,259
can't do a little search do a research

619
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:05,418
project and get a poster out of it

620
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:09,620
but every single one of these kids does

621
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,419
and they do amazing work so I've been

622
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:14,808
fortunate to have one every year

623
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:19,879
this is Kaitlin she's from Wisconsin

624
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:21,648
she's one of either 8 or 11 kids she

625
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:24,378
came to the station with a little

626
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:26,298
suitcase and I said you know don't you

627
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:28,668
have more stuff and she said well I'm

628
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:31,429
one of you know eight kids we had five

629
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,509
kids a three-year absent and triplets so

630
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:35,509
she's a triplet

631
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:39,980
she was really low maintenance so it's a

632
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:41,269
wonderful bright girl but loved being at

633
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,579
the station we

634
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,650
looked at ornamental crafts so Nina

635
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:47,899
knows I started in ornamentals and I

636
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,790
love them so this is my creative side

637
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm not going to replace smart grant

638
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:58,159
with this she's frigid

639
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,769
with his Ostrom area but these are

640
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,720
columnar and different lobing and so she

641
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,980
was able to look at lo being and the

642
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,309
genetics of that in an eight week period

643
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,799
my last scholar before this year looked

644
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:15,799
at fruit set and cider apples so bad

645
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,769
were looking at and the beauty of apple

646
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,569
is she looked at fruit set and a malice

647
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:22,670
phosphor cross that we're looking at

648
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:25,549
because of tannin content for a hard

649
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,830
cider but she gets data that she can

650
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,819
publish because nobody's really looked

651
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:30,819
at fruit sadness

652
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:40,039
biron Rostock was my last sturdy and

653
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,320
Jeff was also a student in the the

654
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,259
Summer Scholars Program and he was able

655
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:48,769
to do phenotyping of a progeny that Ben

656
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:51,230
had done GBS for and was able to

657
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:53,599
discover a new QTL for the columnar

658
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,809
locust in that eight week project so

659
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,089
it's it's pretty amazing okay so I'm

660
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,669
going to wrap it up quickly red skin

661
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:03,259
color red is dominant to yellow but what

662
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,810
they don't tell you is what does that

663
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:08,329
mean so we have a red apple we can have

664
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,980
a green apple we developed a marker for

665
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,559
red and yellow but it didn't work for

666
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,250
green I have been trying to breed a

667
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,950
green apple and I have created the most

668
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,890
sickling Lee shade of greens that you

669
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:25,700
can ever imagine they they don't come

670
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,490
out pretty so we have learned that it's

671
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,529
due to a mid transcription factor we're

672
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,170
doing transgenic studies not us but

673
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,720
others on overexpression but the color

674
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:40,519
pattern whether it's striped or our

675
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:43,519
blushed matters now this is just the

676
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,019
kind of the Wow so these red apples

677
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,859
which I'm sorry I don't know your name

678
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,839
katie loves our sour they're going to

679
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,369
market them and I think I predict that

680
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,769
people are going to buy them once and

681
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,469
say well I was in the school and then

682
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,179
by the begun but I said that about

683
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,220
rocket apples and they got bought out

684
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:05,470
for 8 million so I better keep my day

685
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,900
job but what I'm showing you is the

686
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,970
Caitlin went out and she looked at the

687
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,340
progenation she said all the leaves are

688
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,769
green and I said that can't be they have

689
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:19,639
a dominant gene for red well look at the

690
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:22,519
laterals so I don't I can't explain this

691
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:26,030
the leaves came out green and then the

692
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:29,990
laterals produced red after that so

693
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:31,609
maybe a phase change so this is just a

694
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,799
bit of the diversity where we're looking

695
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:37,089
at beautiful double flowers scab

696
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,279
resistant different forms and shapes

697
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:43,519
emphasizing disease resistance we look

698
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,759
at resistance to scab and blessed to

699
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,869
have her bald Winkle a vase Khan care

700
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,619
Cox

701
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:54,489
a number of people that collaborate in

702
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:56,899
plant pathology and I'm gonna miss a few

703
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,019
we look at scab resistance powdery

704
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,800
mildew black rot climate change is real

705
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:06,440
we have southern diseases and you need

706
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,960
to know what your material is because we

707
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,090
love this novel stuff but another

708
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,579
breeder said well if you want if you

709
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:15,500
want my crazy stuff - I usually throw it

710
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:18,049
out but I think that we're going to

711
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,170
we're going to get answers by having

712
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:23,808
some of that crazy stuff so this I love

713
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,019
because this is one fruit in a

714
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:30,619
population of an ugly high-quality apple

715
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:33,289
i mean ugly by a speckled apple that's

716
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,178
good quality and you can see that i

717
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,639
think the yellow is an out cross but you

718
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:42,790
can see that you get varying degrees of

719
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:45,890
red and color you get ugly again and

720
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,230
then you get pretty amazing lenticels

721
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:51,080
and the quality of these things is

722
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,929
amazing so every single Apple is good

723
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:58,069
that does not usually happen Bruce knows

724
00:32:53,929 --> 00:33:01,730
that there's a fruit size five genes for

725
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:04,308
fruit size I hit the jackpot on this I

726
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:07,039
can't win the lottery but I can line up

727
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:08,418
those genes for fruit size where we show

728
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,858
that he's going to pull an apple

729
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,869
so we're gonna laugh all the way to the

730
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:15,259
bank I don't think so

731
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:17,778
reduced vitamin C is important for Apple

732
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:20,269
dippers this was andreas research that

733
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:23,509
shows some of our advanced selections

734
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:26,868
are amazingly high in vitamin C compared

735
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:29,358
to the standard varieties we do

736
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:31,548
transgenic research when I say we I mean

737
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:34,849
lalang a vase

738
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:39,319
Kanaan so silencing is teaching us about

739
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:41,599
ethylene and Other Stories LaLanne has

740
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:44,178
reduced sorbitol lines and of course is

741
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,219
interested in arctic apples now I don't

742
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:49,820
I show this especially with Peter here I

743
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:54,079
am Pro biotechnology what it offers but

744
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:57,108
it's amazing what groups do to prey on

745
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,710
your heart because that's brilliant to

746
00:33:57,108 --> 00:34:04,460
have a baby you know I'm a baby sucker

747
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,350
let's have a baby and Snow White and you

748
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,510
know it's not based on science but it

749
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:11,480
does resonate with a lot of people and

750
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,520
so arctic apples are being test marketed

751
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,159
now so we'll see what the public decides

752
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,378
we have a number of different hybrids

753
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,250
with potential for future

754
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:21,889
commercialization we're writing three

755
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,929
patents right now I apologize the

756
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,419
problem with having apples is I wanted

757
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:32,148
to bring some today but they're not

758
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:33,618
easily carried so I owe you one again

759
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:35,690
acknowledged in current and former

760
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:38,298
students my technicians Cornell

761
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,789
colleagues USDA everybody has been

762
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:42,829
amazingly generous we've been able to

763
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:45,980
garner funding from different sources

764
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:48,818
and I showed the shop Martin definitely

765
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:52,280
after fall to show that we really are

766
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:54,199
creating some very productive apples but

767
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,910
somebody asked me why I engineered them

768
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:01,460
not to have leaves so thank you for

769
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:04,068
attending and I'm glad to answer any

770
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,019
questions if anybody has them and I'm

771
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,058
going to reach out to my Geneva crew

772
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:12,409
because I feel bad that I'm not there so

773
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:16,630
Geneva do you have any questions I

774
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:20,118
learned from Kevin this fall that

775
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,789
Snapdragon does not drop below

776
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:24,800
on the fruit a pressure of 20 and

777
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,318
therefore you have to decide when to

778
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,190
pick it by the starch number and so is

779
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:34,039
that a beneficial character which

780
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,450
improves this post-harvest behavior and

781
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,289
if so are we going to see more

782
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:41,598
selections very similar yeah we have a

783
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:44,239
we have a lot of selections that are

784
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,059
performing very well from a storage and

785
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,318
shelf-life perspective

786
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:55,338
thanks Jay any other questions of Geneva

787
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:59,119
okay if it was turned on many years ago

788
00:35:55,338 --> 00:36:00,469
we had a researcher from Geneva film

789
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,880
Forest Lawn yes

790
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:08,779
speak about the origins and in your

791
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:14,930
early years of breeding were you able to

792
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:18,710
learn from um feels a wonderful person

793
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:22,129
and at that time I was not so interested

794
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,470
in going back and quality so malice

795
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,710
adversity is the progenitor species but

796
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:30,858
it's yellow it falls off the tree it's

797
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:33,769
pretty acid and so I admit that I you

798
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:36,588
know kind of put it aside now we are

799
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:38,509
very much embracing the use of inertia

800
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:41,480
Pacific hybrids Phil is going to be with

801
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,970
her bill all dwink Alon a CBS News show

802
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,809
on the Cossack apples and their trip to

803
00:36:43,969 --> 00:37:01,578
to the center of diversity so I probably

804
00:36:47,809 --> 00:37:04,460
should have but I didn't Peter yeah so

805
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,680
that's the key is you need you want a

806
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,139
branch angle to be as close as 90

807
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:12,348
degrees as possible that's the strongest

808
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:14,059
branch homeowners tend to have very you

809
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:15,650
know they're not pruning it or training

810
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:24,259
it they'll be like this and then that's

811
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:27,440
weak and it'll just crack yes and also

812
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,839
not dropping the fruit that has its

813
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,130
disadvantages because if fruit don't

814
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:37,599
draw the when we thin them some

815
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:40,150
money stayin and that's a a veneer for

816
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,239
further diseases I got criticized that

817
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,820
my apples are too firm and I was like

818
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:48,639
that's not criticism you know I

819
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,170
understand that people with dentures

820
00:37:48,639 --> 00:38:03,069
aren't going to like it but just use a

821
00:37:50,170 --> 00:38:05,320
knife then you know type does the the

822
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,720
would stop and I'm sorry and I

823
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,990
apologized so the progeny because I

824
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:13,449
forgot to repeat the question so the

825
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:15,549
question is if the rootstock affects the

826
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:18,399
variety absolutely so there are

827
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,430
resistances and the root stocks it can

828
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,900
make them bear earlier it influences

829
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,619
branch angle which I thought was

830
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,400
brilliant

831
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:29,139
there's also influences on calcium and

832
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,840
magnesium so the work that were laying

833
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:34,869
them been and others are doing so the

834
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,059
rootstock holds a lot of potential and

835
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:39,369
that's why I really think being able to

836
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:42,809
study what gets transported and what

837
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,809
doesn't would be hugely helpful

838
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:03,010
okay so he was asking about how does a

839
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,490
club work what about when other people

840
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,290
outside of New York State want access so

841
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:10,959
one grower asked if he could buy a foot

842
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:14,400
of land in New York and become a New

843
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,659
York grower we do have the ability to

844
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,940
sublicense and I think in the future

845
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:20,589
cosmic crisp is going to come from

846
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,869
Washington with millions and millions of

847
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,300
boxes so I think we will sublicense to

848
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:29,650
other states but for international

849
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:31,300
marketing we are we are going to license

850
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,000
to other countries with the caveat that

851
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,660
they can't export into the u.s. so that

852
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,940
protects our our industry we had a

853
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:42,159
grower from a nursery mint from Belgium

854
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,710
and he said we went out to dinner and he

855
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,449
asked the waitress about Snapdragon and

856
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,088
she just looked at him like

857
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:51,189
what and he said I came all the way from

858
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:53,710
Belgium to test this variety and she

859
00:39:51,190 --> 00:40:00,389
said this is where you get humbled sure

860
00:39:53,710 --> 00:40:00,389
you did any other questions

861
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:15,368
tastes like very sweet

862
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,190
how do you deal with that your selection

863
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:21,039
okay so I so the question was how do you

864
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,170
deal with that some like 70% of the

865
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,630
population tends to like a sweet apple

866
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,220
where 30% tends to like the tart apple

867
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,960
how do we deal with that in our breeding

868
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:33,578
i i've been consumers if they're exposed

869
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,820
to something outside of their comfort

870
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:39,880
zone will embrace it

871
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,769
and so i think especially we're losing a

872
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,289
lot of the kid market and i think we

873
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:47,550
have some robust things that children

874
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:50,500
would like more than adults so i'm

875
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,740
selecting a wide range of things and I'm

876
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:59,289
not going for middle-of-the-road because

877
00:40:53,739 --> 00:41:01,059
that's a dangerous precedent to say well

878
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:09,039
you've been a great audience thank you

879
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:12,789
very much this has been a production of

880
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:15,480
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

881
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:15,480
