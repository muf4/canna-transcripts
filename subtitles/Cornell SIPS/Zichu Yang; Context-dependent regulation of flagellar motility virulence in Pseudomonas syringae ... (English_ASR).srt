1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,679
University um so today my talk uh first

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,679
I want and another thing I want to thank

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,118
Brian for his kind introduction it has

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,600
always been a great pleasure for me to

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,679
work in this lab since I was honrad and

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,199
uh I believe that will convey to you

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,879
through my presentation okay so today

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,800
we're going to talk about uh motility

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,759
regulation in this pathogenic system as

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,600
moning G pass Our tomato disease

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,439
resultant and the first thing I want to

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
touch on is to show you a little bit

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,439
about this bacteria so here you have a

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,640
picture of our road shap stus cell this

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,320
is a regosa cell unfortunately not a

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,039
sery but this is the highest uh uh

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,359
resolution I can find uh on the internet

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,039
so you can see that uh we have a rod

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,559
shaped uh cell and with polar flagala

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,478
which we we will touch on in a minute

22
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:07,200
but our species suumo Seri is a plant

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,039
pathogenic bacteria that has a wide Host

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,320
range because there's over 60 total

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,640
Passover uh the model strand we're

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,478
interested in uh is dc3000 which is a

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,960
tomato pathogen but can also affect uh

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,039
arabidopsis as well as tomato uh this

29
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,118
strain has been developed as a model

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,880
strand largely thanks to people in this

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,040
department on this very campus because

32
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,599
uh people like Alan comr and Greg Martin

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,118
we know oh we know a lot and a lot about

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,519
their types series equation system and

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,640
infectors so but today I'm going to talk

36
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,399
about not the uh verance part of it but

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,879
the mtil part of it and I got into this

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,680
because when I joined the lab back in

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,599
2017 uh swingle lab has already been

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,600
working on motility for a while and this

41
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,199
is the result at the time I joined the

42
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:05,718
lab where you have uh s disease

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,080
resultant use this motility to invade uh

44
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,799
to evade plan immunity especially the

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
part of uh PTI which is where the plant

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,760
are detecting

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,000
feling so without going too much into

48
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,439
this uh the detail about this model

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,360
which uh concerns a chapter of my S that

50
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,639
I won't be present here today but will

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,120
probably come up in my B exam uh I just

52
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:31,199
want to say that at the time we already

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,719
know a little bit about uh motility in

54
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,639
has this ecological function so what

55
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,080
motility are we talking about there are

56
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,799
total five different types of motility

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,920
that are present in

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,640
bacteria uh and we're mostly concerned

59
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,399
about swimming motility in this strand

60
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,279
so uh several features of swimming

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,519
motility I'd like to point out is one it

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,000
requires the bacteria to be inside of a

63
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,719
certain liquid or semi liquid

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,878
environment two it needs this file

65
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,039
it needs fum as the main organ if you

66
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:09,000
would say or as a main structure it

67
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,959
relies on to facilitate the movement and

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,719
three it is consuming energy the uh the

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,719
fum rotation relies on proton Moto Force

70
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,280
to power itself to generate the torque

71
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,519
and pull the bacteria

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,239
forward now motility in bacteria in

73
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,879
general has been topic of study for past

74
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,280
half century or more and the most

75
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,199
well-known model of motility regulation

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,719
in all of bacteria is

77
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:43,759
chemotaxis this is a kind of a algorithm

78
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,000
or building the bacteria if you say that

79
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,079
follows a very simple logic it always

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
want to improve the chemical uh

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,360
environment for the bacteria and here

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,438
I'm showing you that if you put a

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,799
bacteria a hypothetical scenario where

84
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,280
you have from cold color to warm color

85
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,920
the concentration of say a neutrient or

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,438
some kind of chemical bacteria really

87
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:12,679
likes and you have our a polar Flite uh

88
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:14,959
fulum bacteria such as ponas going uh

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,079
moving or swimming inside this

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,079
environment so what you would observe in

91
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,840
any case would be kind of run and Tumble

92
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,000
model which describes the movement and

93
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,439
the sudden break and then the

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,439
disassociation of all

95
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:37,360
of all the po polar flum and then

96
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:40,000
reorientation at a random angle and it's

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,240
also described as a bias random walk

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,439
because uh the randomness of the break

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,560
but also it's biased towards in such a

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,879
way that when it's going above or it

101
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,280
when it's climbing the the gradient of

102
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,279
the nutrient or the chemical it actually

103
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,399
likes it has a lower probability of stop

104
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,359
and reorient so the biased r more well

105
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:07,879
ended up help the bacteria move uh to a

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,038
higher concentration of the of the

107
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,600
chemical that it actually

108
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:16,120
likes

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,240
so ponus is a well annotated strand is

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,160
one of the F uh this is resultant is one

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,240
of the first fully sequenced bacteria uh

112
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,840
plant pathogenic bacterium thanks to

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:31,160
that we can fully transfer the knowledge

114
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:33,599
we know on eoli and all other IIA uh

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,439
about this chemotaxis regulation into

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,439
this strin now this is a very

117
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,279
complicated system and I won't go into

118
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,038
much detail about it but all I want to

119
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,559
show here is that we know what these

120
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,918
genes are in our genome and we can find

121
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,639
them by any kind of like screening uh we

122
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:54,839
have so let's touch a little bit on what

123
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,800
motility can do in general the most

124
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,638
basic function of motility in any

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,439
bacteria is try to get to different

126
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,120
different location where there are

127
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,079
nutrients present and on the it's kind

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,280
of like the two sides of the same coin

129
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,758
that you can also kind of get away from

130
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:16,638
your clone mates so as a group of the

131
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:20,000
same identical strands you are evading

132
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,280
competition with your king and that way

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,639
your group in general or overall will

134
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,559
have a higher efficiency at uptaking

135
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,160
nutrients to into your organism and help

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,478
with reproduction and so on or other uh

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,319
important functions so as I elud to a

138
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,439
little bit earlier our group has been

139
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,720
working on the bacteria using its

140
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:47,038
motility to evade plant immunity so one

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,880
other motility what other functions can

142
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:54,598
motility achieve in a plant pathogenic

143
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:57,279
bacteria well in our example the plant

144
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,959
uh thisas result and getting to plant

145
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,399
apple plast and the challeng is face in

146
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,839
there is that the PTI is detecting it uh

147
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:09,638
the PTI is detecting using feling and so

148
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:12,279
on so that adaptation as our lab has

149
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,680
previously found uh is that it can use

150
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,318
LG to downregulate motility as well as

151
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,360
fla synthesis there you can apply the

152
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,439
same logic to other locations where the

153
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,160
plant pathogenic bacteria can land on

154
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,598
such as Leaf surface before they enter

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,439
the aplast uh Steve Lind group uh in UC

156
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,839
Berkeley has previously found that some

157
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,240
of the challenges plant paic bacteria

158
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,519
can face on top of leaf surface includes

159
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
it is has it has very unevenly

160
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:45,240
distributed nutrient and as we all know

161
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,758
as plant uh if you're ever taken a 3010

162
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,918
or 4010 you know that there's also very

163
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,158
limited entrance into APO Plus for any

164
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,680
bacteria pathogen of uh plant so that

165
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,839
could potentially be mitigated by kot

166
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,400
taxes there has been literatures showing

167
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,839
that

168
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,758
bacteria can use some kind of organic

169
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,638
acid as a signal they're tracking to

170
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,439
find those natural openings and wounds

171
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,360
well but there are also other known uh

172
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,478
challenges that are present on the plant

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,158
surface such as the extra environmental

174
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,519
hazard from the sound the UV lights and

175
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:22,839
also civil lindos group has also shown

176
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,038
that there's very high osmotic stress on

177
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,878
top of that uh and another thing that

178
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,240
haven't been discussed a lot in the

179
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,120
literature is on top of a PL surface you

180
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,839
can have the competition with the

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,839
epified microbiome and we don't yet know

182
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,240
a whole lot about what the bacteria is

183
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,599
doing to deal with or to cope with those

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,560
challenges but as a small spoiler I

185
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,320
think we have found some evidence in our

186
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,838
screening and uh later I will show you

187
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,320
the data that they might have uh some

188
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,480
mechanism already in place for

189
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,920
that uh in addition to that I'd like to

190
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,039
show you also introduce to you the idea

191
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,159
that the disase resultant is a social

192
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,559
bacteria in that it it engages in social

193
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,879
behavior such as cell cell communication

194
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,199
here I'm showing you that it does hover

195
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:15,000
our a typical Corum sensing system uh

196
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,200
this is how the bacteria is most

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,039
famously known to interact with its own

198
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,399
species as well as some other species

199
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,199
and they can co-ordinate expression of

200
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,278
genes and so on and this is result also

201
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,480
engaging production of public goods such

202
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,439
as surfacant and such th four so here

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,120
you are show seeing the typical or the

204
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
most uh famous yellow pigment p in in

205
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,480
our

206
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,519
stren so with all that I like to present

207
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,440
a question I uh I like to discuss today

208
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,000
uh that is what eological functions can

209
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,800
this isant achieve with this motility

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,519
control because now we already kind of

211
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,199
know it can do a little bit of you know

212
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,120
dealing with the host uh maybe help with

213
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,920
this virulence and such

214
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,519
and with that I'd like to present the

215
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,759
first two chapters of my

216
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,679
thesis the first project I want to get

217
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,519
into is a TNC based screen of noble

218
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,479
swimming mtil gen in this this is a

219
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,240
collaborative project between our lab

220
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,959
and the philal lab uh mainly with uh Dr

221
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,079
Tyler Helman who joined us a couple

222
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:25,958
years back as uh a post do so at the

223
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,519
time we already know that we want to

224
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,919
find novel motility Regulators in this

225
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,679
3,000 because because the LG we have

226
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:38,439
done a couple um screenings with the LG

227
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,519
project and with various success and

228
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Tyler at the time joined us with a very

229
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,200
powerful tool that is

230
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,480
TNC so what exactly is TN well TS in its

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
essentiality is asking the same

232
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,600
questions over and over again across the

233
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,719
genome that is if a strand has a point

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,360
mutation in this is introduced by

235
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,440
transposon insertion in a given Locus in

236
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,600
genome does that strength grow Better or

237
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
Worse under any type of environmental

238
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
selection you impose or not

239
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,799
impose so you can imagine that we have

240
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,278
two strands here each represented here

241
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,399
uh those black dashes represent their

242
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,320
relative abundance or how many copies

243
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,759
there are in a population the first

244
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,240
strand we have here has a copy uh has an

245
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,958
insertion on the tip of G A and the

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,360
second strand we're talking about here

247
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,919
has a insertion that at end of the g b

248
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,480
so what you can do here is you can pull

249
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,039
this Library population pull them and

250
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,519
let them go through some kind of

251
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,120
selection and after they grow you can

252
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,320
sample the posterior or the after

253
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,360
selection population and then count the

254
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,079
relative abundance of the copies of each

255
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,959
of those strands and with that you can

256
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:58,319
see that g a in this uh hypothetical

257
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,838
scenario it's abundance decreased after

258
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,079
the selection whereas g b remain more or

259
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,000
less the same and with that we can say

260
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:11,278
oh G A the loss of function in G A is

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,320
not is preventing the growth of that

262
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,919
strand under our selector uh under our

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,920
selection

264
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,519
criteria so with that we can scale it up

265
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,958
and make it a full

266
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,120
screen instead of just one strand

267
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:29,679
purging you can have multiple

268
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,959
now and so for each one of those strands

269
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,159
you can calculate the relative abundance

270
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:39,159
of the the before and after our

271
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,958
selection in the in the final in the the

272
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,078
respective populations and with all of

273
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,239
those strength inness or the strength

274
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:50,278
relative abundance you can calculate the

275
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,799
gene average thinness so that will be a

276
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:56,879
ratio that is either below one equal to

277
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:59,359
one or above one and this helps us to

278
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:05,120
establish a link between a gross genome

279
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,919
type to a Gene's function to uh a Gene's

280
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,480
contribution to a selected function and

281
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,799
this selection is totally arbitrary we

282
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,360
can manipulate it as we

283
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:19,799
want um and ttler come with us uh come

284
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,320
to us with this method as well as a

285
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,719
library that has been generated by Dr uh

286
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,600
Jennifer Lis in UC Berkeley which has uh

287
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
been mapped but hasn't unfortunately

288
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,199
been published

289
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,278
uh and another note here is that uh in

290
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,319
the data I will present you in the

291
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,240
following slides those ratios will be

292
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,639
converted by log scale so everything

293
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,039
that's below one will now be negative

294
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,240
and everything above one will be

295
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,319
positive well so now we have this

296
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,919
powerful tool the next thing to figure

297
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,519
out is how we do we link that to

298
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,759
motility because we're essentially

299
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,720
interested in motility contributing

300
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,959
genes well the at the time when I join

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,639
the lab

302
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:06,000
this method of using soft hour swimming

303
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,600
media to quantify the swimming phenotype

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,078
is already long established in the lab

305
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,879
and also it's a standard uh method in

306
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,559
the field so what you do here is you

307
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,078
just inoculate your bacteria strand in

308
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,758
the middle of a 3% aror plate in this

309
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,719
case I'm showing you a minimal medium

310
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,959
that is Mob spaced uh and you let it

311
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,278
grow for this is resultant in this

312
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,159
particular media con uh recipe it really

313
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,679
takes 48 hours for you to get to the

314
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:39,519
size of decent measurement and if we're

315
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,799
dealing with some kind of mutant that

316
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,078
does not actually uh move or somehow

317
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,639
have impaired motility it the colony

318
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,638
simply does not expand from the

319
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,079
inoculation point so the logic of this

320
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,000
essay is that the low motil low motility

321
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,239
strength cannot move far from the

322
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,600
ination

323
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,079
point so how do we incorporate that and

324
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,759
the TNC method to make a

325
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,559
screen

326
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,519
well the most easy thing to do is just

327
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,399
like BR force and fuse them together so

328
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,480
well that's what we started doing um so

329
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,360
we take the library culture and we make

330
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,480
an inoculum from that which is easy and

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,839
we take the time zero sample as you do

332
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,120
in all TNC experiments and you and we

333
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,120
just inoculate and let the swimming

334
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,240
asset go with a library so this is a not

335
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
a single strand but a pool of bacteria

336
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,039
strands that each has a single mutation

337
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,519
somewhere in the genome and we let them

338
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:43,078
grow we sample everything that's in the

339
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:46,879
red circle which is a whole colony and

340
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:51,239
then we use that as our samples to

341
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:53,519
repeat this process or we just uh and in

342
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,799
addition to that we also keep a sample

343
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,679
for DNA extraction and

344
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:03,000
barsic so in that you can see that the

345
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,198
selection we're imposing here is not

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,799
much it's just the growth in the media

347
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:11,000
recipe we provide them and as well as

348
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,359
the swimming

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,318
Aur so the the expected hits we are

350
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,199
looking for here is that we're looking

351
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,879
for nutrient restrictions because this

352
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,278
is a minimal medium and also metabolism

353
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,799
genes that help them going through those

354
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,838
nutrient um but we're also thinking

355
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,039
because this is a

356
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,000
this is a neutron limiting environment

357
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,000
so motility will help in this case and

358
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,600
we're not sure how many of those we will

359
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,879
find so let's just roll with this and

360
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,639
set up a

361
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,559
baseline but in the end what we found is

362
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,480
we actually hit a quite a lot of

363
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:52,318
motility genes so here I'm showing you

364
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,039
uh the four tiers of th motility

365
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:57,838
regulation that is present in origin

366
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,120
sudon orosa and I'm transplanting that

367
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,240
here uh in this is resultant genome so

368
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,038
here you can see some of them are in

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,720
white those are the ones that are

370
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,240
missing homologues in our strand uh the

371
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,240
ones in Gray are the ones we didn't find

372
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,038
in our mutant Library uh at all and then

373
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,640
the red ones are the ones that we found

374
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,919
across the seven replicates we did with

375
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
uh seven total passages we did if at any

376
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,079
any point of time they have a

377
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,279
significant penalty for loss of function

378
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,119
so that means those strands with if the

379
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,359
bacteria has a lot of function in any of

380
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:39,359
those genes they're not growing or we're

381
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:43,479
not P getting them from the final

382
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:46,159
samples uh black means the the ones uh

383
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,279
black means exactly opposite of that

384
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:54,360
meaning that they are always uh being

385
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:58,960
recovered so we found total 34 out of 47

386
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:01,599
uh of this and that is pretty nice but

387
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
also we're still facing the problem that

388
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,839
we need to distinguish them from the

389
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,199
nutrient restriction genes and

390
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:12,519
Metabolism

391
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:15,080
genes so to counter that uh after long

392
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,558
time of trying to figure out what to do

393
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,199
uh I came up with this scheme which

394
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,038
turns out to be I I think it's intuitive

395
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,319
at least is that if we add another layer

396
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,839
of selection what if now I select

397
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,399
against motility if the bacteria if the

398
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,918
environment itself is selecting for

399
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,640
motility and I then add an arbitrary

400
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,559
selection against motility doesn't that

401
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,080
mean only the motility genes will

402
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,798
respond to this selection they are still

403
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,279
growing in the same Neutron condition

404
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:46,720
and all so they should though if those

405
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,678
genes are having high M uh finish

406
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,200
phenotypes they should be present in

407
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,120
both groups but if there is a difference

408
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,798
between those two selection schemes

409
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,839
those should be the response I detect

410
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:02,879
from just the motility contributing CHS

411
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:05,119
so we want with this uh model and the

412
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
first thing we expect is well now we're

413
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,599
selecting against motility so the

414
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:14,038
motility should decrease on population

415
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:17,599
level and voila they did uh which is

416
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,879
pretty neat and when we then look into

417
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,558
how the finish for genes are behaving

418
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,280
across these

419
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:29,319
passages we found a very clear

420
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:31,399
split uh that when we're selecting for

421
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,720
everything the population kind of

422
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,360
evolved this way and when we're

423
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,000
selecting just for the uh non motal

424
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,759
population in the middle of the plate

425
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
the population evolved in a very

426
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,558
different

427
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,799
trajectory so what do we find so so this

428
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,798
is a good start we think we're hitting

429
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:52,720
something so we look into the highest uh

430
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:55,519
finish values or finish phenotypes we

431
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,360
have in all the all of these lists of

432
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,879
genes and we found three groups of them

433
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,678
that are behaving very differently the

434
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,600
first group represented by the

435
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,038
chemotaxis genes uh QB and kyy these are

436
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:12,439
known chemot taxis uh motility

437
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:15,599
contributors they have a fness that is

438
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,960
lower when the whole con is passage when

439
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,879
the plate itself is selecting for modil

440
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,360
but when we then added the extra layer

441
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,520
of selection they reverse back their

442
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,759
finish to be positive meaning now losing

443
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,558
those genes are not as bad for the

444
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,960
strengths once select for low motility

445
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,839
the second group represented by FL motor

446
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,038
genes mode a and mode B uh do the exact

447
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,759
opposite their response is flipped and

448
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,400
that is still a mystery to us why they

449
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,879
would do this uh and then the third

450
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,600
group of genes which I think most of

451
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,520
this audience will be interesting is why

452
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:55,558
we hit HP three equation CH uh they are

453
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,279
active and they are having a positive in

454
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:01,678
scores in either cases meaning that

455
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:04,038
they're on in this uh minimal medium

456
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,000
situation but mob's minimal medium is

457
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:09,119
not the Euro hard minimal medium pH so

458
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,519
we're very curious why they're actually

459
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:16,879
on here U and we tested them they didn't

460
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,839
BR do anything to motility

461
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,240
unfortunately uh and those three groups

462
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,959
when we plot out every Gene and their

463
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,519
respones across all our passages you can

464
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,038
see a very clear split of this

465
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,960
Rears so because we have so much so many

466
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,119
more questions about the second and the

467
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,240
third group of genes we ended up

468
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,719
focusing on the chemotax genes because

469
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,038
we know what their phenotypes should

470
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,200
look like once we go into individual

471
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,158
mutational study of this

472
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,080
genes and the three members uh other

473
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,360
members of this group are pspd 46 which

474
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:55,480
is a cyc GMP enzyme so this uh kind of

475
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,759
like links it to multil in its nature

476
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,679
just by what we know about cyen p and we

477
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,278
find that well indeed you have a

478
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:06,278
phenotype where you knock it out and

479
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,599
it's slightly uh it impairs motility and

480
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,679
when you complement it back the motility

481
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,599
come back a little bit not fully but

482
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,880
partially also this is a overex

483
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,839
expression instead of its natural

484
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,960
promoters uh T 42 is another interesting

485
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,199
one because this is anti-ma factor for

486
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,960
oxidative stress that has been shown uh

487
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,880
uh by the previous member of philal lab

488
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,278
and it has not really been link to

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,760
motility or confirmed to link to

490
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,359
motility in the past and we found it has

491
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,960
a very clean impaired motility by now

492
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,599
Cod and overe expression at completely

493
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,558
restor the mtil phenotype here so that's

494
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,158
telling us that there are linkage

495
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,399
between stress response and motility

496
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,919
control the Ecology of it we don't know

497
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,000
yet and then the outb of Mo the

498
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,278
hypothetical protein pspto

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,200
429 absolutely stunning result in that

500
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,319
knock out knocking it out does not

501
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
really do that much it slightly impairs

502
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,879
motility but when we overexpress it it

503
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,919
abolishes

504
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:13,400
motility so very odd and we don't know

505
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:17,480
anything about it that's where we get

506
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,679
SRA acted into go for in on

507
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,919
40229 um so this is a hypothal protein

508
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,519
as many of them are their small proteins

509
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,200
that it has total amino acid

510
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:32,440
273 it has a only annotation on the

511
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,278
protein is hdod domain from 23 to 210

512
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,919
which does not tell you really anything

513
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,519
hdod domain is such a general term that

514
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,640
incorporates all kinds of functions it

515
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,319
doesn't really contain much information

516
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,480
and I'm showing you a kind of a model

517
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,278
here so we tried a whole bunch of

518
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,599
methods trying to figure out what this

519
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,278
protein is doing the one that ended up

520
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:56,240
working for us is error P PCR so this is

521
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,119
we generate another Library well that's

522
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,278
a lot of Library generation within one

523
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:04,558
talk there's one more um so we generate

524
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:07,278
a library of sequence each with few

525
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,918
single point mutations by aror Point PCR

526
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,038
so this is you're trying to use a

527
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,640
different polymerase and so on trying to

528
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,000
get error sequence happening during PCR

529
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,240
and then we fuse that we put all of them

530
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,960
into our expression constructs and ask

531
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:27,079
them to perform uh on swimming media so

532
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:31,038
what happens there is because we know

533
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:33,759
the while type 429 overe exer phenotype

534
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,798
is complete abolishment of motility is

535
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,398
very easy to screen for them and we

536
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:44,519
ended up getting 40 different plasmids

537
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:47,439
that are uh having fail to suppress mtil

538
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,679
phenotypes um so here I'm showing all

539
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,880
the sequence we got amino acid sequence

540
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,679
we got that are still fallen and uh I'd

541
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
like to divert your concentration into

542
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,759
the conservation plot here in yellow

543
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,639
these are where we found among those

544
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,960
Fallen sequences that are having

545
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,880
mutations from the wild type which is on

546
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,759
top uh and also we use this tool called

547
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
scan it which can predict protein

548
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,079
protein interaction by just inputting

549
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,480
amino acid sequence that is recently

550
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:20,038
developed and that gives us a prediction

551
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,519
on each uh amino acid residual How

552
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,359
likely they are involved in protein

553
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,440
protein interaction and we indeed find

554
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:30,639
the highest uh predicted interacting

555
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,919
side is kind of like aligning with a hot

556
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,679
spot here so we went in and we did the

557
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,720
mutation we replace those two arginines

558
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,440
that are being flagged out with

559
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,519
allings and we found that the phenotype

560
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,080
is

561
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,359
gone so great now we know there is an

562
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:54,319
important residu for this suppression

563
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:57,599
phenotype uh the ecolog of it again no

564
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,439
idea so what have tell you so far for

565
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,480
just one of those uh for the first

566
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,038
project is that one TN is again very

567
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,880
powerful as Lori told you a couple weeks

568
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,720
ago and as long as you can select a

569
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,600
function this is a tool that can get you

570
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,278
most of the Gen you're interested in or

571
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,079
give you great candidates uh second

572
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:21,679
swimming motility in this can be

573
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,158
co-regulated by stress response uh with

574
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,360
no previously known connections to

575
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,919
motility uh 4229 has a dominant

576
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,319
suppression FAL on motility it's

577
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,278
swimming but as additional note it's

578
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,960
also swarming I didn't show the

579
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:40,000
phenotype here uh and yeah because we

580
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,960
know nothing about the ecological

581
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,200
significance of this there's a lot more

582
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,000
study to do uh if we want to follow up

583
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,919
on them so I hope this has picked some

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
of your interest in motility because the

585
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
next story is going to be a little bit

586
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,000
more wild than

587
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,799
this um I'm showing I don't know how

588
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,720
much it's showing here but I'm showing

589
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,440
you a very weirdly shaped disas Colony

590
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,480
here and this is something we found

591
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,440
almost

592
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,159
coincidentally or by accident uh back in

593
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,919
the days and this is a socially induced

594
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,159
disas res swimming motility we call

595
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,919
beted

596
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,760
expansion so back when I joined the lab

597
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,840
uh Brian and Kar was interested in the

598
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,359
phenotype when you put two colonies of

599
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,119
the same species bacteria onto swim

600
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,558
media they somehow form this Gap and

601
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,839
they don't they behave slightly

602
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:39,038
different than they were if they are

603
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:41,439
growing along so I was uh I had the job

604
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,558
to replicate this phenotype uh a bunch

605
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,360
of times and in doing that we also

606
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:49,639
incorporate the interspecies

607
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,158
interactions as sort of like a a second

608
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,840
control for these

609
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,880
phenotypes so in doing that what I

610
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:59,359
realized is sudas is doing something

611
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:03,679
weird when sudas is paed again deia on

612
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:06,519
third day or uh paired with eoli or

613
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,000
zenonas on fifth day you start to see

614
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,440
the colonies are doing something uh on

615
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,640
this edges that are closer to the

616
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,240
interaction partner and I was very

617
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,278
interested by this I don't know what

618
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,319
they're doing but I want to study it so

619
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,960
I try to standardize it the problem is

620
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,759
this colonies are not really

621
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,798
standardized this one is on day three

622
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,759
this one day five day five

623
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:35,519
so I need a way to bring them to a more

624
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:38,359
comparable level so my solution I

625
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,759
because the strands were using uh our

626
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:43,959
model strands and our strands with more

627
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,720
genetic uh resource wisdom I was able to

628
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,159
get non motal mutants of them and

629
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,120
standardize this phenotype to such so

630
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,240
you can see that when you have a unated

631
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:56,599
control of disas result and is more

632
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,880
regular uh is radial and a uh symmetric

633
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:03,038
whereas when you have a EOL bait here it

634
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,840
start to behave non symmetric uh the

635
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,240
same with DK but when you put another

636
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,839
disis result and as it's interacting

637
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,679
partner here it's back to being

638
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:18,119
radium so great now we have a

639
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,240
standardized phenotype I can start to

640
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,278
quantify

641
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,319
this the first thing we quantify is how

642
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,278
much grow they are having on each side

643
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,519
or how much the bacteria Colony

644
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:31,319
expanding on each Direction regarding

645
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:34,159
the position of the bait so here you can

646
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,558
see the blue uh lines here represents

647
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,840
the proximal because it's Crossing well

648
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,918
to the bait uh and the red uh is the

649
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,639
disto because it's away from the bait

650
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,120
from the both stars and the inoculation

651
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,399
point and the quantification of that uh

652
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,319
is laying up here you can see that with

653
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:55,959
eoli or dekia as a bait the overall

654
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,599
Colony expansion is up but within the

655
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,679
two sides of the colony the proximal

656
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,398
especially is induced by the presence of

657
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,679
a

658
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:10,079
bait and we can we later uh we recently

659
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,880
come up with this actually is to trace

660
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,599
the colony edges and then just overlay

661
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,240
them to show that there is a significant

662
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,798
difference in how the colony morphology

663
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,200
is happening so here you can see that

664
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,158
even with uh control plas made so

665
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,440
they're growing slightly slower than the

666
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,120
previously shown uh you still have the

667
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,880
extra growth or expansion on the side as

668
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:37,599
is close to the bait proximal to the

669
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,600
bait so the next question I had for this

670
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,639
was uh is this cimot taxes because it

671
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,599
looks very much like Chim tax to me for

672
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,120
two reasons one is directional kot taxis

673
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,558
is always directional and two we

674
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:54,479
observed uh in many of our replicates

675
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:56,678
that if you're the the closer location

676
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,200
of a back single bacteria is located or

677
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:02,000
of a colony this this resultant colony

678
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,000
to aate you seem to get stronger effect

679
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,240
so those are chemotaxis like features of

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,480
what we're seeing here however we our

681
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,359
collection of chemotaxis mutants are

682
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,120
usually nonmodal which means you just

683
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,558
don't get motility and you can't really

684
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,398
use them to test whether they are behind

685
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,759
this phenotype so the next thing we

686
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:27,439
could do was to test for

687
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:30,879
inducibility so the idea of that test is

688
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
if you have a chemotaxis like Behavior

689
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,600
where it's tracking some kind of

690
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,240
accumulable s chemical signals or

691
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,959
depletion of that you can just let the

692
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,159
depletion or accumulation happen for

693
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,079
longer and then that should provoke even

694
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,639
stronger

695
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:50,638
response and we kind of find that uh

696
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:52,319
this is a Pyon I'm showing with Aria

697
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:56,079
amalo

698
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,158
e273 as a bait and you can see that this

699
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,599
bait here has been in alculated 20 4

700
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,159
hours before the disase resultant colony

701
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,240
is inoculated on the right you have a

702
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,799
bait that's the same species of aronia

703
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,519
that's inoculated at the same uh time

704
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:14,558
Point as your disas resultant and you

705
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,200
can see a very clear Behavior difference

706
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:20,119
this one has stronger diff uh

707
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,038
Behavior we can also replicate that uh

708
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:26,638
with the tracing but with ecoi it still

709
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:28,960
provokes a very different back uh Colony

710
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:31,278
morphology but in this case is more

711
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,919
lateral expansion so it's more on the

712
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:37,839
sides of the

713
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,120
colony so with that our conclusion here

714
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:43,158
is that it is something that's

715
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,199
accumulating it's either accumulating of

716
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,840
a signal or depletion of a signal but

717
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,440
it's accumulable in its nature the next

718
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:55,558
thing we did here is we're interested in

719
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,200
what is the driving force for this

720
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:00,638
Behavior to manifest and at the time we

721
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,360
have two hypothesis we it can be either

722
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:06,558
gross difference so maybe this part is

723
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:09,678
growing more or it is a major uh

724
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,720
motility difference and to test that

725
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,559
what I ended up doing is I ended up

726
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,120
cutting the plate in half so that

727
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,319
separates the plate whole plate into two

728
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,038
sides one is proximal to the bait the

729
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,319
other is distal to the

730
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:26,319
bait and I'm curious where whether those

731
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,000
two parts of the colony are actually

732
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,439
having similar amount of viable

733
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,038
cells so we did the

734
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:40,038
test and indeed when a colony is baited

735
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:43,278
the proximal side is having more viable

736
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:45,599
cells than the digal side whereas when

737
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:49,000
it's just a normal Colony growing on own

738
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,119
that didn't happen but very very uh to

739
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,398
our like biggest surprise here is that

740
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,038
we couldn't detect the immediate finish

741
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:59,518
benefit of doing the behavior because

742
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,798
the total viable El in the colony is not

743
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,880
significantly

744
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:07,798
different so that push us more laning

745
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,599
towards this is a motility phenotype

746
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,320
rather than a gross

747
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,760
phenotype so we recently uh with the

748
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,800
help of the new fancy microscope we got

749
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,960
we were able to look at that more

750
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,240
closely uh under that and here I'm

751
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,358
showing you on the top uh so in this

752
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,398
panel the bait is is towards the left on

753
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,159
the top I'm showing you the sampling uh

754
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,480
the field of view that's fixed

755
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,480
coordinate on the proximal edge of the

756
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,639
population and on the bottom is on the

757
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,280
distal and you can see that on the

758
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,760
proximal you have uh so the this is 3,

759
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,440
here is Tagg with gfp and you can see on

760
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,320
the proximal Edge you have faster growth

761
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,519
the intensity changes over the 90

762
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,320
minutes course a lot whereas on the

763
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,079
bottom there's not

764
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,200
much uh but also you can see the

765
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,400
movement of the cells so I it might be a

766
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,519
little bit hard to see on this

767
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,519
resolution but uh the first Y Line is

768
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:15,519
where I marked the initial Edge uh at

769
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,079
the beginning of 48 Hours post

770
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,199
inoculation is and the the what this

771
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,079
line here is where I could our larger

772
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:27,879
our higher resolution find the edge of

773
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,160
this this Colony uh the same is for the

774
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,280
bottom so the short of the story is over

775
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:37,519
90 minutes of observation the proximal

776
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,760
Edge moved about 600 microns whereas the

777
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,519
bottom Edge uh the the distal Edge moved

778
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,960
only like less than 200 Micron so we're

779
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,519
seeing that there is a movement

780
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,519
difference

781
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,920
here well since we're seeing that much

782
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:56,000
difference in behavior of those two

783
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,000
edges we're now interesting if we can

784
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,760
find any genetic genetic mark for them

785
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,039
so the approach we took here is we want

786
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,359
to sample those Edge populations and see

787
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:12,039
if we can find uh a transcriptomic

788
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:15,000
difference and indeed we do so here I'm

789
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:19,358
showing you exactly where we sampled on

790
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,719
each plate we used the most distal Edge

791
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:27,239
or the most proximal Edge to aate within

792
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,639
our disant colony and with wrong our

793
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,639
withle

794
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:34,719
and at the end of day what we found is

795
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,920
the proximal edges that are most close

796
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,399
to eoli bait and the proximal Edge

797
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,639
that's most close to a dek bait are

798
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,680
behaving very very differently than all

799
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:47,279
the other edges we were able to sample

800
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:50,960
and those edges kind of mix together

801
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,599
which is more clear on this PCA plot so

802
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,199
you have the deia in blue and Eola in

803
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,519
this red uh eclipse

804
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,639
so the biggest uh so we went into the

805
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,400
list we think we found something and we

806
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,559
want to is a list of differentially

807
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,480
regulated gen the biggest uh F change we

808
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,960
found was with this hypothetical Gene

809
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,760
another hypothetical Gene pspto

810
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,240
5639 does not have any information but

811
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,560
in the very close neighborhood we also

812
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,479
find this more aging and we were able to

813
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:28,159
confirm both of them are indeed uh

814
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,559
induced in that popul in in the proximal

815
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:34,598
population towards a bait

816
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:38,679
uh by qrtpcr

817
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,838
so what does that do more a it is

818
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,879
annotated and we know from it annotation

819
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:47,239
that it incles mum co-actor biosynthesis

820
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,680
protein a it's also a gtps for what we

821
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:53,919
know uh Moco is a highly conserved uh

822
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,960
function across bacteria species and

823
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,880
also across kingdoms so even humans and

824
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,519
uh plants have Olin co-actors they're

825
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,519
involved in Redux enzymes and also uh

826
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,519
those are involved in global softare

827
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,960
nitrogen and carbon Cycles Mo a again uh

828
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:16,519
additionally Mo a was the only heat

829
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,720
among all the RNC data we have uh within

830
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:21,199
this moal function within all the genes

831
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:25,639
that are linked to mum co-actor

832
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:28,239
function so well but we're genetics what

833
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:33,400
can we do we knock it out

834
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:35,479
and find out that it somehow mitigates

835
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,519
or eliminates the

836
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,838
phenotype but when you put it back you

837
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:44,239
have the extra growth as you can see the

838
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:47,119
tiny like w type control here when you

839
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,679
add it back by OV expression that extra

840
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,400
growth come

841
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:56,440
back so great Mo a is our

842
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,838
guy but is it the gtps part or is it the

843
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,760
moal part

844
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:05,078
because GTP interact with GTP that also

845
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,960
can potentially interact with cycl digp

846
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,640
so we're really curious which uh

847
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,039
approach did it take to actually

848
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:15,239
influence motility and in this case our

849
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,239
Behavior so we look into what's in the

850
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,679
moo

851
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:22,559
bensis and uh this is a moo bensis genes

852
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,519
in coli and we picked another essential

853
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,358
Gene for this file synthesis function we

854
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:31,719
picked MOA which is the last in the step

855
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:34,679
of moo assembly where it in insert the

856
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,078
mum actually to the co-actor

857
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,559
complex and we did the genetic thing

858
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,119
again by knocking it

859
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:46,960
out and again we were able to see this

860
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,200
phenotype or this Behavior disappeared

861
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,639
when we knock it out and come back when

862
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:55,239
we overexpress

863
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:58,358
it so great now we know moo is our guy

864
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:01,358
instead of just Mo a so what I have told

865
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:03,759
you so far is that uh in this chapter is

866
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,598
that swiming motility is socially

867
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,839
inducible and the behavior Rec call beta

868
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,720
expansion is tracking some kind of

869
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,679
accumulable uh signals be it's the

870
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:17,358
actual accumulation or depletion we also

871
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:20,239
know that beted expansion results more

872
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:23,519
from motility rather than growth uh from

873
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,559
our extraction or viable cell counting

874
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,519
assay and last but not the least moo

875
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,279
contributes to to the development and it

876
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:34,039
seems to be essential to the whole

877
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,839
behavior and now we enter the wild

878
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:39,239
speculation

879
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,519
word is it just me or does this look

880
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:44,279
like a charge to you

881
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:49,039
too like this looks very aggressive to

882
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,800
me right so we don't yet know that much

883
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,639
about its ecology we have speculations

884
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,920
here and one of our speculations is that

885
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,639
this is a competition behavior and it's

886
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,480
trying to get closer for either

887
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,159
territorial rench or getting into a

888
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,760
closer position to initi to initiate one

889
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,159
of the uh cell cell interaction

890
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,800
mechanism such as type six secretion or

891
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,279
actual cell killing we have no

892
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,400
information of those genes being uppr

893
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,040
regulated in our RC data at all not type

894
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,440
six not any like toxin production or

895
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,318
anything like that but we cannot rule

896
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,079
out ones they together they might do it

897
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:31,000
um but again this is just fascinating

898
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,839
and I've been looking at this and think

899
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,280
of this for last six years and we still

900
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:42,199
haven't cracked it

901
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:44,800
yet um so as a as a summary I hope uh

902
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:48,318
those materials have pick your interest

903
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,640
in motility in our very uh closely

904
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,599
studied disease resultant bacteria hope

905
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:55,759
you that help you appreciate that

906
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,599
motility regulations can respond to

907
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,400
social interactions as well well as

908
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,359
environmental stress and there's a lot

909
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,200
more ecology to be studied in this

910
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:11,358
system uh with that I like to thank uh

911
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,639
the past and coverent Steve uh swingle

912
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:17,440
lab members our collaborators Dr Jan

913
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:20,000
leis Dr T Helman Po in the audience uh

914
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,240
and uh the Cornell T-Rex and BRC that

915
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,318
helps us with a lot of the sequencing

916
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:28,039
stuff we do i' like to also thank my

917
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:31,440
committee members uh and everyone that I

918
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,558
interact in the office daily as well as

919
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,000
uh the amazing postdoc and uh graduate

920
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,359
student body uh I'd like to make one

921
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,599
more comment I have a bunch of friends

922
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:46,199
who told me I'm the like happiest

923
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,599
graduate student they ever

924
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,159
seen um and I think that's largely

925
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,280
because I'm inan this amazing community

926
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,598
and I work in amazing lab um and with

927
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,599
that I like to have my birds take

928
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,240
question from me but I will speak for

929
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,640
them so any questions for eigor Josh so

930
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:09,118
in your the second part of the talk

931
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:11,118
bacterial baiting and such the ones that

932
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,920
it's swarming towards or charging as you

933
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,838
put it at the end can it eat those

934
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,720
bacteria and or if you mix them together

935
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,519
or Co inoculate at the same time or put

936
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,159
them really close to each other does the

937
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,800
pseudomonas kill the like eoli or

938
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:29,960
whatever else is there so we have done

939
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,318
some m is oh okay so the question is if

940
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,639
we just co- inoculate the two bacteria

941
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,159
together are there evidence of uh

942
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,598
killing happening uh we haven't been

943
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:42,838
able to observe any like killing with

944
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,480
like stance and stuff uh yet we were

945
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,719
able to see suppression but if we co

946
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,159
inoculate in liquid culture but that

947
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:53,039
could also just be neutrient competition

948
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,000
uh instead of active killing we don't

949
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,880
have a lot of evidence on or we we have

950
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
very few evidence on that actual toxin

951
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,400
production or anything is involved in

952
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,039
these interactions so our main

953
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,358
hypothesis right now is that it's a it's

954
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,318
a competition Behavior but it's on the

955
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,920
level of exploitive competition where

956
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:14,400
it's just trying to grab more nutrient

957
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,159
for

958
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,838
yourself

959
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:22,639
loric really great talk um I had a

960
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,318
question about uh your TNC data um so

961
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,838
you pulled out these like type three

962
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:30,279
secretion signals do you think um um

963
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,078
since this is like I guess a social

964
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,000
interaction like do you think there's a

965
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,839
possibility of uh like another way that

966
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,760
you could look for things that might be

967
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:40,679
signals that are going between cells

968
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,480
presumably those would not come out of a

969
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:46,078
TNC because they'd be like shared among

970
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,679
the population but like can you is there

971
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,760
some other way you could look for like

972
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,039
what those type three secretion signals

973
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,160
are like what they're signaling or what

974
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:57,440
they're sensing or whatever yeah so the

975
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,440
question is is there alter alternative

976
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,760
message to screen for or look for like a

977
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,159
signal that is being transferred in

978
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,680
between the bait and the and the Dison

979
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:12,399
Colony our lab has done something before

980
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:17,039
trying to go like you know Mass back and

981
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,880
stuff like that uh we didn't really get

982
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,440
anywhere with that um I remember one of

983
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,200
the so that happened when I was do

984
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,800
honrad I think and uh the another GR

985
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:33,239
undergrad at the time Mel who was

986
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,559
working on this and I remember the

987
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,118
comment he made was there's so much

988
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:41,200
processing in so so what he was trying

989
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,960
to do was trying to extract the gel in

990
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,838
between the colonies and trying to

991
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,960
figure out if we can find something in

992
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:51,318
there u i remember the comment back then

993
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,599
was though they were super processed

994
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:56,719
like there are so many layers of

995
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:59,119
processing that he was pretty negative

996
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:03,598
about like potentially finding anything

997
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,599
and I don't think we ended up finding

998
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:09,079
anything I was gonna say like do the the

999
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,598
secretion genes you found do they do is

1000
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,160
there is there anything known about what

1001
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,838
they're transporting like that help get

1002
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:18,558
at that at all the secretion genes I

1003
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:24,039
found are there any information about

1004
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:27,920
what they could be so for the social uh

1005
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:30,800
motility so MOA a is not not a secret so

1006
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,519
malum co-actor in general are not well I

1007
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,359
think all of them are not secreted

1008
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:36,079
they're

1009
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,759
cytoplasmic so we don't that actually

1010
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,800
didn't point us to any directions that

1011
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,160
leads to like a potential secreted

1012
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,960
signal into the into the space I guess I

1013
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,920
was talking about the the hits from your

1014
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,760
TNC your your type three secretion hits

1015
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,119
oh okay so that actually does not

1016
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:00,920
involve in does not relate to the

1017
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:04,200
motility so social motility yeah Adam

1018
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,358
question typ you got in that hit you

1019
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,439
said you were surprised by those hits

1020
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,719
because those genes aren't even

1021
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,240
expressed under those conditions did you

1022
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,838
confirm that they're not

1023
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,199
expressed uh we were okay so Adam's

1024
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:21,318
question is were did we confirm the type

1025
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:24,679
three secretion genes were uh active in

1026
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:28,639
the uh mob's minimal media

1027
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:30,838
condition we did not going to that rout

1028
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,799
so when we found that uh the type

1029
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:35,279
secretion type three secretion genes are

1030
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,400
there what we did is we pulled out all

1031
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,960
the mutants we have on types three and

1032
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,119
did motility assd with them and we found

1033
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,838
that they weren't really affecting

1034
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:48,079
motility so the only other explanation

1035
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,239
is they were on and they were taking a

1036
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,519
toll on the metabolistic or on the

1037
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,078
energy for the bacteria so that their

1038
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,318
growth might be negatively affected by

1039
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,480
having them there that's what that's our

1040
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,599
hypothesis for why we might have those

1041
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,599
hits Zoom

1042
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:09,599
chat a lot of congratulations thank you

1043
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:13,760
all um but no

1044
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,760
question no further questions let's

1045
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:26,960
than this has been a production of

1046
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:29,959
Cornell University on the web at Cor
