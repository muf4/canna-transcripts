farmer so Frank thanks for joining us

35
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,039
and I think you're going to see why he

36
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:37,920
uh you might be wondering at this point

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
what's the link between living sculpture

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
and art and grass and he will be showing

39
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,680
you there'll be no doubt about

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,320
that yeah that's the first time I've had

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,040
to listen to that used to be really

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,319
short somebody my wife was nudging me

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,560
that I should write on there but then

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,559
there's the risk of sounding like a nut

45
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:04,639
do um as Marsha said

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,039
uh thanks to Mara and Craig and all the

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,598
people that work to put this on Max

48
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:14,360
downstairs um I'm really uh thrilled to

49
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:17,280
be here uh and I'm I have to tell you

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,040
spending most of my life as kind of a

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,080
functional Turf person um this has been

52
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,919
a real gosh I think we started this four

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,599
or five maybe was was it five years ago

54
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,399
you started with me in the art of

55
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:33,199
horticulture and what I want I want to

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,879
start out with the end and the end is

57
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,199
that the best part

58
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:43,079
about my involvement in all this stuff

59
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,079
has been how it stretched me I'm a very

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,920
you know I was a golf course

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,640
superintendent I'm not a big golfer I'm

62
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,639
really just a grass guy I've spent most

63
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,079
of my life I was born and raised in the

64
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,439
for section of the Bronx so I don't have

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,560
a lot of you know glorious grass stories

66
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,359
be Beyond pushing a lawn mower and

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
trying to get out to a golf course for

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,680
some open space so a lot of my grass

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,519
stuff both in golf and sports um filter

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,920
strips and functional things and now

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,080
alaca pastures has been very functional

72
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,958
and what I've liked about this work is

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,799
that it's really kind of stretched me a

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,479
lot and um and I think that's one of the

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,519
great things that comes at at doing this

76
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,719
work uh and that's why I was happy and

77
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,879
of course honored to be able to give the

78
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,318
opening talk because I think what you're

79
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,318
going to experience today is is is is

80
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,479
this stretching I mean there's a you get

81
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,039
there as a pile of dirt and a load of

82
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,598
grass and next thing you know it's

83
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:43,598
something and so I I look forward to

84
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,438
seeing uh I wish I I hope I get to be

85
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,679
there to see your faces at the very end

86
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:48,959
because I think as Mara said from

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,599
Longwood that's really the cool thing

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
about um this work and I hope that we

89
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,679
can uh just get you started with some

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,680
ideas uh to stretch you beyond uh what

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,360
you do

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:07,239
today so uh go back so we'll see a lot

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,439
of these kinds of pictures um uh this is

94
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,680
actually uh obviously near the London

95
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:16,439
Bridge this was a de a promotion for a

96
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,400
uh TV program in in the UK uh with a a

97
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,040
sculptured swimmer and mounded grass to

98
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,079
look like water we'll look we'll look at

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
this a little more closely as we get

100
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,159
into the form so we titled this The

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,360
Thrill of the grass and Craig Kramer uh

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,039
gave me one of these uh short stories

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,560
from WP canella which is the title of

104
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,519
his story and this story is about a guy

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,079
who goes on steel side from a field and

106
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,038
takes it home so it's really kind of a

107
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:46,719
fascinating story this is um U myin who

108
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,839
did their get nothing this is in the

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,360
Hudson Valley here newk and these are

110
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,918
just these Earth mounts uh that she done

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,680
there really easy to do um and and very

112
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,120
uh as as most of her work very symbolic

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,280
and of course what

114
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,079
what we're trying to do is to uh what

115
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,038
I'm trying to talk to you about and get

116
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,279
you inspired about is using uh Earth as

117
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,319
a canvas which is not unique to us here

118
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,159
but I think uh with Marsha's leadership

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,038
really I think have done some really

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,639
cool

121
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,000
things and of course we can be fairly

122
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,840
Whimsical um this is an artist down in

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,038
Texas who uh her lawn was dormant uh

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,079
Bermuda grass or dormant St Augustine

125
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,318
grass whatever the heck that crab grass

126
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,318
is you're growing down there f

127
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,840
um it looks much better with polka dots

128
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,520
sprayed on it and then of course there's

129
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,519
the functional aspect and that's where I

130
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,599
want to start this is what's been the

131
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,839
most comfortable for me um grass is

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,240
function this is uh in between the

133
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,599
strips on this tram uh where obviously

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,280
there's pavement they grass it and we've

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,919
been doing a lot of work with Nina

136
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,918
bassic uh looking at um uh the struct

137
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,318
this structural soil she developed that

138
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,918
they can grow Street trees on we're now

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,598
using it to grow grass on and thinking

140
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,639
about starting to replace these 4 acre

141
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,800
Walmart Mark parking lots with grass

142
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,960
parking lots that can then filter a lot

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,079
of the pollutants that would come off

144
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,839
the vehicles in the parking lot we're

145
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,120
nuts about grass in this country and I'm

146
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,719
sure you know that uh just in New York

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,759
state alone we have about 3 and a half

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:33,280
million Acres of turf that we would call

149
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:37,919
Turf m managed grass and we spend about5

150
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:42,478
billion a year in New York state about

151
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:46,038
75 to 80 billion nationally is spent

152
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,079
managing grass so we're absolutely nutty

153
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,959
about grass and you know I I think I

154
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,639
spend most of my career trying to figure

155
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,159
out how to help us not be so nutty but

156
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,400
the fact is most of that money is spent

157
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,280
by homeowners in and around their lawns

158
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,959
so some people go to

159
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,000
extremes take the alwn out pile up some

160
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,079
gravel and of course then you know on a

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,959
hot summer day you're going to feel

162
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,680
fairly warm matter of fact you may see

163
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,439
one of the more ridiculous things in

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,720
your life walking outside today if you

165
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,399
venture out at all uh if on this side of

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,199
Campus where we have some of our Sports

167
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:26,159
Fields there's a synthetic turf field

168
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:29,800
hockey field plastic grass that we water

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,400
four times a day with with only be

170
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,598
described as a fire hose sprinkler to

171
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,198
cool it off because it's so warm to play

172
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,839
on that the athletes can't stay on it

173
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,720
very long unless it's unless it's cool

174
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,000
off now functionally obviously this is a

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
moss mat you come out of the shower and

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,918
step on that that's actually not such a

177
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,240
bad deal and of course A lot of these

178
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,439
things you can buy or do

179
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,079
yourself now back to the functional part

180
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,800
I spend a lot of my time working at a

181
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:03,120
fairly uh you know with school school

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,879
districts uh regular folk trying to have

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,158
decent grass for the safety of their

184
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,158
athletes and then we get to talk about

185
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,519
how even at the professional level uh

186
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,918
managing tur for these athletes to

187
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,639
ensure their safety maximize their

188
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,598
performance and ensure their safety is

189
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,158
really critical this was of course a

190
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,560
game that the Pittsburgh Steelers played

191
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:26,038
a number of years ago where they brought

192
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,839
in grass and SED over an existing field

193
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,120
three inches of rainfall and it turned

194
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,319
into a muddy mess where the athletes

195
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,639
weren't safe at all so we spent a lot of

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,399
time trying to help uh clubs and

197
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,559
athletes uh have a safe surface to plan

198
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,519
now there is an aesthetic part to what

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,319
we do it looks you know what you do for

200
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,278
looks and this is actually one of our

201
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,240
research experiments where we're looking

202
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,958
at different forms of iron iron is one

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,680
of the really critical nutrients for

204
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,719
color in a in a green plant because it's

205
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,399
involved in the chlorophyll molecule so

206
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
if you really want to do something crazy

207
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,919
on your lawn and don't want to fertilize

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,720
it and we've done some work looking at

209
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:11,159
using iron as opposed to um fertilizers

210
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,120
that might contaminate water quality um

211
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,399
we found that iron is a really easy way

212
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,639
to get green grass without having to get

213
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,360
it to grow so much this is something we

214
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,958
were experimenting with now of course

215
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,720
golf courses we one could find some art

216
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,639
in this little practice facility that

217
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
was built and you start to see some of

218
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,240
the striping effects the inter with the

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
bunkers at different heights of cut

220
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,000
you've got a green a putting surface cut

221
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,078
at about a tenth of an inch a fairway

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,839
cut at about a third of an inch and then

223
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,559
you've got grass around the bunkers that

224
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,560
are probably cut at about two or three

225
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,799
inches so sometimes just different

226
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,239
heights can give you a very different

227
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,078
look this is the flower hole at the

228
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,278
Stevens Point Country Club in Central

229
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,000
Wisconsin where I used to work before I

230
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:59,200
came back to Cornell they changed this

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,320
floral display three times a year of

232
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,320
course I'm sure all of you are looking

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,480
at the flowers I'm always of course

234
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,839
looking at the grass U but the contrast

235
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,639
here between the colors in the you know

236
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,120
the Deep green of the grass and the uh

237
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,759
various colors of the flowers they

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,639
change this display three times a year

239
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:22,958
it takes about 14 employees the better

240
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:25,399
part of 40 hours to change the floral

241
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,799
displays here's one of my favorite

242
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,000
pictures this is Bandon Dunes or Pacific

243
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:34,039
Dunes Golf Course right along the South

244
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,440
Western Oregon coast it's a fairly new

245
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:40,039
golf course and what I love is how grass

246
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,279
kind of brings out the subtle wrinkles

247
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,078
in the earth here there was very little

248
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,320
done when this golf course was built and

249
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:50,519
designed by Cornell Al do this is a very

250
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,079
minimalist Golf Course um very little

251
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,799
was done here you can see they just kind

252
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,838
of threw some sand in places this is

253
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,399
just a beautiful piece of land that uh

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,320
they planted some grass over the the top

255
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,039
and there's very little management done

256
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,600
out there uh to keep this a playable

257
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,319
surface of course you can get ridiculous

258
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,639
with this and some people like golf so

259
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
much they do it in their office nothing

260
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,039
living there and then there's of course

261
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,078
the occasional fool who decides to Grass

262
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,679
his entire inside of the house and

263
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,919
sucking the fumes you can imagine why

264
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,278
he's so

265
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,838
happy and then there's the functional

266
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,799
aspect of room so we have a room inside

267
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,760
and here is a room at the State Fair the

268
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,838
New York State Fair last year um there

269
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,000
was a living sculpture demonstration

270
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,360
done there where they built a couple of

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,240
uh sitting chairs a little love seat a

272
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,480
couch which you will uh be involved in

273
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,560
working on

274
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,920
today and one of the things that we're

275
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,799
you know constantly you know obviously

276
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,479
it looks good right now you're going to

277
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,078
get to do something today that might

278
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,000
help it sustain itself sometimes getting

279
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,439
these things watered and keeping them

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,759
healthy um is a little tricky so we've

281
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,839
been figuring out ways of doing that in

282
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,360
a sustainable

283
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,880
fashion um I get to work in some fairly

284
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,159
ridiculous environments um this is a

285
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,958
project I've been working on for the

286
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,078
last five years associated with the 65th

287
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,439
Street uh renovation for Lincoln Center

288
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:20,799
uh the Lincoln Center development

289
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,800
project this is the conceptual drawing

290
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,719
that they started with about five years

291
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,198
ago and this is what it looked like last

292
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,920
week this is the juliard school right

293
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,000
here this is the addition to the Julie

294
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:37,599
art school this is Alice Tully Hall and

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,759
this is a $25 million lawn

296
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,839
roof which is going to be a park on top

297
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:46,639
of a restaurant on 65th Street so pretty

298
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
soon you'll get to see this uh In Living

299
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,079
Color if you live down in Manhattan or

300
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,519
wander down that way this is at Q

301
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,919
Gardens again

302
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,320
functionally grass can be a great thing

303
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,719
for

304
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,839
bleachers maybe for stepping stumes

305
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,879
maybe for just functionally having it in

306
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,440
your backyard for stairs up and down or

307
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,439
just giving you that cascading

308
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,560
effect and make transition to using

309
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,560
grass for forms this is at Dartmouth

310
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,119
College at

311
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,958
uh Dartmouth in in New Hampshire I can

312
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,879
tell you that one of the things that

313
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,000
guys like me struggle with is architects

314
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,120
who sit there draw on a piece of paper

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,559
and say oh isn't that look really cool

316
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,679
and then somebody's got to take care of

317
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,838
it the poor guy's got to you know have a

318
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,359
sprinkler that he has here to you know

319
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,639
everybody wants it green and he's got to

320
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,039
climb up here to trim this tip by hand

321
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,320
because you can't really get up there

322
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,599
with anything so um these do create

323
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,959
unique problems uh the students love

324
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,199
them but they are a unique uh uh

325
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,679
maintenance

326
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,758
situation now from a form perspective it

327
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,919
can be fairly simple these are little

328
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,039
indoor grass planters that you can get

329
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,958
on the web just to have out in your in

330
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,719
your

331
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:07,078
house the Chia Professor maybe this is

332
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,839
where your kids will start uh you can

333
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,719
use the uh little plant seeds that they

334
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,800
send you or you can use grass seed just

335
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,920
as

336
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,639
well and here's the swimmer again just

337
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,078
you know a matter of mounding up some

338
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,879
grass and making it look like the uh

339
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,599
swimmer making his way through and you

340
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,439
can see how intricate this is this

341
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,159
obviously the structure is the one of

342
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,440
the highlights here but you can see the

343
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,600
interaction with his face and the grass

344
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,440
there and the Mounds looking where his

345
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,560
hands are going in um it's just really a

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,279
fascinating display and again one of the

347
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,879
things about some of this artwork is it

348
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,639
doesn't stay around long you do it looks

349
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,360
really cool and then they take it away

350
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,399
and all that lives are the pictures

351
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,000
there's my project this is the moss

352
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,799
snake this is from that Turf Works book

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,639
by Paul Cooper Paul Cooper who we was

354
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,838
here a number of years ago that was very

355
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,159
pleasant in meeting him and he we took

356
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,639
some of these scans right out of his

357
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,278
book again nothing more than some Stone

358
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,680
and one of the tricks we use for Moss is

359
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,480
mixing it with in a blender with

360
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,479
buttermilk take Moss put it in a blender

361
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,480
mix it up with buttermilk and just smear

362
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,278
it on there and you know it grows on

363
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,600
rocks long as it gets a little bit of

364
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,600
moisture it usually will grow fairly

365
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,720
well

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,800
some really interesting uh structures

367
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,199
that you can do with longer grass uh as

368
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,519
well as planting grass over a uh almost

369
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:41,958
like a

370
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
topar now one of the things that I've

371
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,159
liked about this is you know when you go

372
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,480
start looking around for these things

373
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,639
you see how people use grass you know to

374
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,759
make a statement and this is at the

375
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,198
University of Illinois um they planted

376
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:59,879
these boxes to represent the age child

377
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:04,399
fatality statistics there's 3,000 Blades

378
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:07,000
of grass in a square foot and and to De

379
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,440
to uh recognize the

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,318
60,000 uh people per year under the age

381
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,600
of 12 who die of age so they use just

382
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,679
having the grass out there as a way of

383
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,759
honoring that U those

384
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,758
people and then just odd forms of

385
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,519
artwork inside uh a

386
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,278
structure that is basically suspended

387
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,360
from a ceiling with grow lights and sod

388
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,439
laid over the top of

389
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,879
it of course uh again you can use

390
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,720
plastic grass and this is an example of

391
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,958
that where they use some living plant

392
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,040
material for the bucket but the uh

393
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,919
carpet itself here is Synthetic

394
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:55,318
Turf this is the London Museum of

395
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:58,039
Art um and you can see the guy watering

396
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,360
it uh it's basically just a big pile of

397
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,719
grass

398
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,038
and um it's really fascinating at night

399
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,000
when I was there it was really really

400
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:11,038
amazing this is a chapel in

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,359
Czechoslovakia I'm not Czechoslovakia in

402
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,798
the Czech

403
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,438
Republic someone sent me this

404
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,240
one Craig sends me a lot of these but

405
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,839
you can see they put grass on the

406
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,038
outside as well as on the inside and you

407
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,359
can see it growing here and and

408
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:28,119
basically it's the kind of thing that

409
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,359
they do and then strip off and every

410
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,239
year will redo it and of course

411
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,399
completely recycle all the things that

412
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,599
are used to do it but the structure

413
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
itself is

414
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,439
cement and of course here's a little

415
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,279
topiary thing with some grass on it and

416
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,720
of course now you can start again in

417
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,759
getting into the Whimsical a little bit

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,880
um the giraffe uh on the lawn people

419
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,038
like putting things on their lawns then

420
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,320
we get into the whole animal range and

421
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,919
you'll meet one of our favorite animal

422
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,678
construction people Danielle today uh

423
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,679
this is again out of uh that Turf Works

424
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,080
book again uh if you can't have grass

425
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,679
alive there's a synthetic version of the

426
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:13,599
bull and here she is um one I think

427
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,640
really one of our stars um I remember

428
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,240
when she was taking Marsh's

429
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,880
class she showed up this was part of one

430
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,038
of her art of horticulture projects she

431
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,240
shows up in my office and um you know

432
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,919
talk about doing this and she has this

433
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,359
tray with her and on the tray are about

434
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,480
seven different farm animals and she's

435
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,199
got a cow a horse and a chicken and a

436
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,880
goat and a pig and sheep and she's like

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,798
this is what I want to do like okay I

438
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,080
don't I think we got to do

439
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:47,519
one let's try to do one and I think uh

440
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,199
it was really uh really epitomized kind

441
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,879
of the energy that she's brought to

442
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:57,038
doing this and um so this is again a

443
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,200
shaped pile of soil and she built this

444
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,119
head with chicken chicken wire and

445
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,120
stuffed it with hay and there's these

446
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,839
2x4s that are attaching it into the soil

447
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:10,199
pile and I can tell you of all the

448
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,678
graduations of the 15 or 16 graduation

449
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,360
weekends I've been a part of I've never

450
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,798
seen so many people gathered around a

451
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,639
single thing uh in my entire career here

452
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,359
everybody wanted their picture taken on

453
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,480
graduation weekend in front of Morrison

454
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:31,038
Hall and the C doesn't have a name is it

455
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,038
Daisy misty

456
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,879
misty and there's some more more of uh

457
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,000
Danielle's work now what what was

458
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,000
fascinating about this piece of project

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,720
is is it evolved it started out as green

460
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,440
grass shaped letters for the College of

461
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,519
agricultural and Life Sciences right

462
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,240
cows right out on the quad but then as

463
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,879
it started to die and go

464
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,200
dormant she spray painted it black and

465
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,080
white so it had a whole another

466
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,798
um life after it was still

467
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,558
living now here's this is how simple

468
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,400
this is this was uh Marsha's from a few

469
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,359
years ago one of her art of horticulture

470
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,080
projects with a bunch of students and we

471
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:17,000
had a couple of hours to do it my staff

472
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,359
um made gave us a pile of dirt and

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,679
that's what you'll start out with today

474
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,439
if you're doing this particular project

475
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,120
and then we get out there and we get all

476
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,080
kinds of people running side cutters

477
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,879
here I am

478
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:33,399
supervising and the idea was to create

479
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,720
this walk path um around this mound and

480
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,080
that's what it looked like when we were

481
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,798
done we cut the side from an adjacent

482
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:42,519
area we used water to kind of Tamp down

483
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,038
the path area and then laid some sod

484
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,639
over the top and there's the class of

485
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,038
the very

486
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,520
end this is the year the following year

487
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,839
the class uh wanted to try something

488
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,558
different so again we started with a

489
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:59,119
mount of dirt we made stairs um and at

490
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,038
the top they planted a door

491
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,759
which I have to tell you that the

492
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,879
Cornell Golf Course is right over here

493
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,599
the eighth hole and there was an

494
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,919
enormous amount of Interest matter of

495
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,278
fact when you come over the hill on the

496
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,080
a pole and you see this all you can

497
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,119
actually see is the door and you're like

498
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,720
what the hell is the door doing out

499
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,678
there and so uh this was really quite a

500
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,159
thing until a 50 mph wind came and took

501
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,159
the door away so it has not the door is

502
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,760
no longer there but the mound is still

503
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,720
there

504
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:34,240
now this is Marsha's project at Longwood

505
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,919
Gardens that uh basically uh again just

506
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,400
another form of soil and grass there was

507
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,400
a a mold made to shape the uh

508
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:49,320
pattern yeah and I just want to Alex

509
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:51,359
lavalo who um is really he had done the

510
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,278
design for this and worked on the

511
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,879
project with me is also one of the

512
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,119
Workshop present yeah and you'll see

513
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
Alex again in another picture here how

514
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,519
long did this live

515
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:05,679
that Liv a week a week and theyed

516
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:08,359
it but it's all

517
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,440
reusable okay now how about furniture

518
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,798
this is some of what you're going to do

519
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,919
nice little bed here and a

520
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,839
chair in the middle of Paris a little

521
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,159
little lawn chair sitting there and you

522
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,959
can see the size of it relative to

523
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,600
things around it's a fairly large

524
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,480
chair and you can do this in your yard

525
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,199
all kinds of lawn furniture you can

526
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,278
actually be fairly sophisticated about

527
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,360
it or you can just take a chase lounge

528
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,240
and lay some lay some grass over the top

529
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,719
of it nice and

530
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,000
easy some variations of sad sofas here's

531
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,319
a nice one integrated into a

532
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,519
garden you can buy a cardboard structure

533
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,319
fill it up with soil and plant some

534
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,879
grass over the top and that's available

535
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,678
at inh habit.com

536
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,880
fairly easy to do um something that you

537
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,240
could do in your own backyard

538
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,919
some Whimsical things these foam grass

539
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,000
blades that we found little sod end

540
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
table

541
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,400
here another bed maybe with some sheets

542
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,679
installed really fairly inviting I

543
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,679
think and then or something simple this

544
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,679
was one of our very first efforts that

545
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,159
Alex built uh this is one of the art of

546
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,840
horiculture students fairly simple

547
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,600
here's how it started out with a bare

548
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:28,278
area a pile of compost that the Cornell

549
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,678
grounds people brought over Alex to

550
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:33,159
shape it and then you've got a side

551
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,798
couch so fairly easy to do do you have

552
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:40,039
to mow these couches you

553
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,599
can um one of the things that we've seen

554
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,038
useful is maybe just a hand trim where

555
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,599
you sit yeah but you don't have to mow

556
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,960
it you can mow it uh mowing encourages

557
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,079
it to spread and get thicker but this

558
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,880
one's so small it could be done by hand

559
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,798
fairly easily yeah I would recommend

560
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,240
that or we have some battery operated

561
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,440
shears that we use too I I don't like

562
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,880
the idea of a string trimmer because

563
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,320
they're very difficult to keep level and

564
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,080
what happens if you've ever worked one

565
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,639
it really pulls it into the ground and

566
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:14,158
then you got these Brown half Moons all

567
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,200
over the structure now this a project

568
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,320
that Mara's husband uh did at one of his

569
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,120
old camps and here's Alex who you'll see

570
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,480
today um again you

571
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,918
know like Tom Watson said over the

572
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,120
weekend a bunch of old fogies right get

573
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,320
around piling up some dirt shaping it

574
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,199
with a little bit of moisture laying

575
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,720
some grass over the top and lo behold

576
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,558
you've got a couch to sit on how long

577
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,600
did that take that took about three four

578
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,000
hours there you go can you use grass

579
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,278
seed or does it have to be all rolled

580
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,159
out yeah very good question um you can

581
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:51,200
use grass seed but then of course you're

582
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,000
waiting but I would recommend on some of

583
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,480
these slopes that if you did that that

584
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,480
you use some kind of erosion mat because

585
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,480
of the the steepness of the slope even

586
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,599
gently watering it um is going to cause

587
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,759
some erosion but you can there's lots of

588
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,759
erosion type mats you can use or you

589
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,200
know even at the Garden Center they sell

590
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,480
the that seed mulch stuff you can just

591
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,640
pack that out like a mud pad if you

592
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,519
don't want to use uh a side now you can

593
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
cut s from one part in your yard and

594
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,240
that's what we did out at the out at our

595
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,519
Research Center where we did it with the

596
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,159
students we just cut it from one place

597
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,519
and Put It In Another

598
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,320
Place Another question sorry like the

599
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:39,278
more complicated CES is there Armature

600
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:41,599
inside um some of them like the there

601
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,599
was one where there are some you know

602
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,959
little pieces of wood or metal just to

603
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,439
kind of hold things together but

604
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,200
generally it's just piles of soil and

605
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,558
once the grass gets stabilized it really

606
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,240
holds it together

607
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,200
further this is a project that Alex did

608
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,038
down at the itha youth Bureau in honor

609
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,440
of Marsha and her husband Scott and

610
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,480
again this is the nice integration of

611
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,440
stonework with a little bit of a couch

612
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,960
here this is right in our little

613
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,440
downtown tberg our little uh this is our

614
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,200
little village where we live in up just

615
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,159
up the lake a little bit and again just

616
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,720
a pile of soil a couple of rocks at the

617
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,320
end I think you Tred time up here didn't

618
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,640
you had that work it didn't work it

619
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,079
didn't work okay it gets too much love

620
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,440
this couch we think the kids love this

621
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,038
little thing here and then some of

622
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,159
Marsha's students have done some lawn

623
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,960
furniture this is nothing more than a

624
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,640
flat of grow mix put in a greenhouse

625
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,558
with tons of Ry grass seed and you make

626
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,559
a little cushion and you pull it out of

627
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:49,079
the flat put it on top of the chair you

628
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:51,480
got a long chair how about an entire bar

629
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,639
not a bad deal this is one of Marsh's

630
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,480
students what was his

631
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,640
name Zack Zach yeah he was a maniac this

632
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,558
this is just a bunch of grass grown on

633
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,278
burlap that we slapped on top of a a um

634
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:12,599
structure he made on Wheels and there's

635
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,599
his little uh Tiki

636
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,759
Bar okay so what about mowing patterns

637
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,558
and you're going to see you're going to

638
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,720
have a little workshop about this this

639
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:25,079
is probably the easiest of all things to

640
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,759
do because it's simply a matter of

641
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:31,558
mowing the grass in different direction

642
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,480
or rolling the grass or in some cases

643
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,558
spritzing it with a little

644
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,038
water there was a I I I actually didn't

645
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,720
incorporate the picture um but if you

646
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,038
watch the Major League Baseball allstar

647
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,319
game which it doesn't look like many of

648
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:45,679
you would actually turn the major league

649
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,599
baseball allar game on but if you did

650
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,399
you would have seen the St Louis they

651
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,558
played it in St Louis and in the

652
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:55,119
Outfield they had an uh in the grass an

653
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,519
image of the Gateway Arch and underneath

654
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,719
it an image burned into the grass assass

655
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,440
of the state of the the state capital of

656
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,480
Missouri and they had these little

657
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,399
windows in there and was talking to the

658
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,599
grounds keeper maybe a month or so ago

659
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:13,199
and he just gets a little water spritzer

660
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,398
sprits the water into these squares mats

661
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,159
the grass down so it's folded in One

662
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:21,319
Direction different from the way the

663
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,039
grass is mowed and you get patterns nice

664
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,960
and simple at Yankee Stadium that's the

665
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,519
way we like it there much more

666
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,840
interested in winning baseball games and

667
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,000
having fancy patterns on the

668
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,480
grass but Dave Miller wrote a wonderful

669
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,119
book called picture perfect if you're

670
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,360
interested in this it's really an

671
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,639
interesting little read very simple how

672
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:42,119
to take care of grass very simply I knew

673
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
Dave when he was the grounds Keeper at

674
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,038
Milwaukee County Stadium where the

675
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,119
Brewers used to play and he was the one

676
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:51,440
that originally started a lot of this

677
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,879
craze that's going on in the um Turf

678
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,080
industry with regard to mowing patterns

679
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,399
Dave is now the grounds keeper for the

680
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,199
Boston Red Sox at

681
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,239
Park so we have we have uh sometimes

682
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,000
grounds managers who maybe have an acid

683
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,480
flashback or something you can imagine

684
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,759
what the athletes and of course if

685
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,599
you're sitting on the other side of the

686
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,359
field it looks completely

687
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,278
different here's the starburst uh again

688
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,639
at County Stadium this was popular there

689
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,679
at sha stadium for a while before they

690
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,919
closed up this is Frontier field in

691
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,759
Rochester and preparation for the AAA

692
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,640
All-Star Game a few years ago again

693
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,558
nothing more than just mowing the

694
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,880
patterns in different

695
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,480
directions this is Rosen blat Stadium

696
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,519
home of the College World Series with

697
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,720
some baseballs on it and it gets fairly

698
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,798
sophisticated um you can get fairly

699
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:47,000
sophisticated or fairly simple this is

700
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:49,879
um uh Corey Miller's uh drawing for her

701
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,440
dad dad can you do this and he went out

702
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,240
to County Stadium

703
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,480
and now sometimes people do some really

704
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,200
goofy things by accident this was a

705
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,360
person in Central Wisconsin who was very

706
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,319
worried about fertilizer running off

707
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:10,879
their lawn so her idea was put the

708
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,918
fertilizer in a drop spreader open it

709
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,399
all the way up run around the lawn and

710
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,159
put the water on really quick because

711
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,759
then it'll all get even right if you

712
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,000
just put it down there and water it it

713
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,919
runs off so much that it'll all get

714
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,519
even we got a call from this person who

715
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,480
thought this was a mold

716
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,240
running around the yard so you can do

717
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,480
these kinds of things just with a little

718
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,079
bit of fertilizer if you course you can

719
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,079
see the fertilizer doesn't move very far

720
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,759
from where you put it down but again it

721
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,439
doesn't have to be very complicated

722
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,599
here's a very simple pattern just mowing

723
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,480
in crop circles if you've ever read

724
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,398
Michael Poland's work particularly in

725
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,919
second nature where he has this chapter

726
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,759
called why mow um he talks about mowing

727
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,559
crop circles in his lawn and most people

728
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,240
can do this fairly easily really the

729
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:06,079
only requirement is is is to have some

730
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,558
sort of a roller or a tire on your

731
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,278
moment very simple little pattern here

732
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,200
in a community leaving an area unmowed

733
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,519
this is getting more popular now as

734
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,080
we're starting to realize the carbon

735
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,120
emission problem from our lawn MERS

736
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,319
we've on been on a real push over the

737
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,759
last several years now to try to get

738
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,200
people to reduce the number of times

739
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,599
that they're mowing their lawns

740
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,480
recognizing number one Lawns are

741
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,839
trapping carbon right green plants are

742
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,240
trapping carbon and that's really good

743
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,038
taking the carbon dioxide out of the

744
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,839
atmosphere but it seems a little odd

745
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:41,960
that we're also burning a fair amount of

746
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,439
carbon to keep the LA so we're

747
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,880
constantly working on ways of being more

748
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,759
sustainable keeping the turf healthy

749
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,360
enough so that it can continue to trap

750
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,558
carbon obviously when it's brown and not

751
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,719
growing it's not trapping much carbon

752
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,879
but at the same time not going crazy

753
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,558
with the mowing strategies so that we're

754
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,760
burning so much carbon here's one that I

755
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,079
found this a lightning strike in a golf

756
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,519
course Fairway you can see sometimes you

757
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:12,000
can get artwork in Turf that you have

758
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,798
absolutely no you have no reason you

759
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,398
weren't involved in it at all other than

760
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,319
you were there to take a picture of

761
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,119
here's that artist in Texas again as the

762
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,960
lawn started to Green up she liked the

763
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:26,119
idea of maybe just purple polka dots

764
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,399
here she is really just a fascinating I

765
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,879
mean I personally think this would be

766
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,759
really cool to live next to something

767
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,320
like this is that just regular spray

768
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,240
paint what kind what it's just uh it's

769
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,918
just they make um they make Athletic

770
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,919
Field marking paint okay that you can

771
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,759
put on the grass doesn't kill the grass

772
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,559
it's good for the environment well you

773
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,079
know relatively I I wouldn't say it's

774
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,879
good for the environment but it's

775
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,278
certainly you know titanium dioxide

776
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,159
often times it wouldn't be something I'd

777
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:56,079
want to necessarily disperse but

778
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,720
certainly it's degradable most of it

779
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,398
degrades okay and how how long would

780
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,319
that last well on the brown grass it

781
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:06,319
would last a fairly long time because

782
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:08,678
it's not growing on the green grass here

783
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,359
I would say at least three weeks to a

784
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,798
month oh it will it just disappear like

785
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,839
it grows off you mow it it blows up

786
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,119
would it rhyme if it started no it

787
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,278
sticks to the grass plants fairly well

788
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,918
it sticks to the grass plants fairly

789
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,319
well now how about some flyovers these

790
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
are this is a little bit of a stretch

791
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,960
for calling it Turf right but but really

792
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,000
some fascinating things this is some uh

793
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,639
Muk soil in Japan where you can tell

794
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,839
where they plowed a little and left some

795
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,678
of the crop but some of this stuff is

796
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,038
absolutely amazing this is actually from

797
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,360
Ellenville New York this is right down

798
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:46,398
here in the cat skills and you I don't

799
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,519
know if you can see them but you can see

800
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,158
some of the hang gliders people hang

801
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:54,159
glide over these

802
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,960
things um some really cool stuff here's

803
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
one of the Hang

804
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,919
liners a promotion for the American

805
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Museum of Natural History Statue of

806
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,480
Liberty again you know not really of

807
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,358
course this is really just a a a a hay

808
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,599
field that was most but you could do the

809
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:12,319
same thing with a lawn if you wanted to

810
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,200
do it from your bedroom you could you

811
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
know get a stencil and Mark it out with

812
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,000
flags and go out there and cut some of

813
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,799
it low and you can do the same thing

814
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,039
there here's my favorite Sarah America

815
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,119
somebody that went to the trouble of

816
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:28,320
doing Sarah Palin in the middle of a the

817
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,679
middle of a Hayfield

818
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,159
so uh and this is one that we did this

819
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,760
is uh Mara one of Marsha's classes uh

820
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,720
this is our turf research facility um

821
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,440
Marsha did a one credit course um where

822
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,239
they worked on designing this thing for

823
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,878
Mother's Day and then they were flying

824
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:51,078
mothers for free uh in planes over to se

825
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,279
and so she actually produced a video

826
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,760
that I think you can get on her website

827
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,119
you think they made a video a DVD of the

828
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,599
production of this and you know some of

829
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,599
it's Mulch and you have hay bales and

830
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,720
some of this stuff here is nothing more

831
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,480
than black plastic that they put over

832
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:11,879
the top to ediate the grass so it gets

833
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,240
bleached you know if you just exclude

834
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,680
light from grass it gets white or yellow

835
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,919
depending on how long I mean eventually

836
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,919
if you leave it on long enough it'll get

837
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,159
brown but if you just leave it on for a

838
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,720
little while basically what you're

839
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:27,440
looking at is light starved grass so you

840
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,279
can do all kinds of things

841
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,200
with different shades of green and maybe

842
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,839
mulches and there's some hay bales here

843
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,319
and this was an area that she we we

844
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,960
killed out and they did a mapole or

845
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,440
something I think they it's a mapole in

846
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,400
the

847
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,800
middle this is along the coast of Oregon

848
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,358
they did a little Continental map here

849
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,079
with grass around it thought that was

850
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:51,799
kind of

851
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,839
interesting how about grass you can

852
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,960
wear right nean Marcus did a big thing a

853
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:00,880
few years ago on Garden at Tire made

854
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,880
some grass shoes again you know nothing

855
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,800
more than you know matted onto burlap

856
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,720
stapled on to a shoe this is again a

857
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,960
large sheet of burlap and you can see

858
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:15,480
here again the use of black plastic to

859
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,720
give that leopard effect by doing a

860
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,199
light excl excluding light from the

861
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:23,838
grass so you get that kind of leopard

862
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:26,358
effect on the grass coat itself here's

863
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:30,639
the garden party uh ad that nean Marcus

864
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:33,239
was running again hat pocket book

865
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:35,559
shoes how about

866
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,719
jewelry this is one of my favorites that

867
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,920
Craig sent me you can here's this little

868
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,719
guy making jewelry Spritz in his little

869
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,000
bit of grass making a fashion statement

870
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:49,199
here with a little tough of grass on the

871
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,199
end or grass Knuckles instead of brass

872
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:56,318
knuckles now here's what you need to do

873
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:59,719
these things burlap cheap grass seed and

874
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:02,239
Peep moss and you can make a

875
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,519
bag this is one of Marsh's students made

876
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,598
a grass pocket book here's a grass dress

877
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,358
how long would that stay green though

878
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,119
like or alive uh as long as you water

879
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,679
really if you put Miracle Grow on it I

880
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,240
bet you you could if you spritzed it

881
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,279
with Miracle Grow once a week and mow it

882
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm sure it would live several months if

883
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,400
you gave it hanging out on the this be

884
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,480
something you put on the clothes line

885
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,680
when it's raining

886
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,960
right instead of pulling the clothes in

887
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,199
from the clothes line put it out there

888
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,000
when it's raining so would the soil run

889
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,519
I mean there's no soil oh okay yeah

890
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
soil's

891
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,920
overrated the burlap the burlap little

892
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,400
bit of pee

893
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,119
Moss we grow sod we have an I mean this

894
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,599
is not I mean yeah this is really cool

895
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,039
but we've been doing this for the last

896
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,519
20 years on black plastic accelerated

897
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,800
sod production is very popular in Europe

898
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,239
they'll use uh you know compost at about

899
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,760
an eighth of an inch throw a ton of

900
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,118
grass on it make a grass mat and use it

901
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,160
for go Ms or other areas that wear out

902
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,119
really quickly on the cross fields and

903
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:11,399
soccer fields so grass doesn't need soil

904
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,880
no wow not if you're prepared to give it

905
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,880
water and nutrients over the

906
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,000
top you ever seen it grow into cracks in

907
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,200
the sidewalk well yeah that's

908
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,800
true see how easy my job is so how about

909
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:27,118
some devices these are somewhat

910
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,200
whimsical

911
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,400
um this is this is Whimsical but it's

912
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,519
actually a reality what $112 million

913
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,280
will buy you this is the University of

914
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,358
Phoenix stadium out uh outside of

915
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,720
Phoenix Arizona where they often play

916
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:44,239
the Super Bowl and the national

917
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:48,159
championship and they wanted to be able

918
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,919
to have a grass field inside now I was

919
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,639
involved in 1994 at at the Pontiac

920
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,880
Silverdome project when I was working at

921
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,639
Michigan State

922
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,440
University where we developed an indoor

923
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,118
grass system to play the World Cup when

924
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,800
the World Cup soccer was here in

925
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,880
1994 and um uh basically what we found

926
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,880
is really grass can't live in these Dome

927
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
stadiums for more than 30 days so we've

928
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,960
had that's why you see a lot of

929
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,199
retractable Dome stadiums they got them

930
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,119
in Arizona and Seattle Milwaukee's got

931
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,879
one where the Dome Houston where the

932
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,039
where you know you open the dome for the

933
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,400
grass and then you close it so that the

934
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,800
creatures can be comfortable when

935
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,000
they're in there well they decided an

936
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,280
alternative to doing that in Phoenix is

937
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,719
to slide the field in and

938
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:41,440
out and there you go the field takes

939
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:44,919
about an hour and 40 minutes it's on

940
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,079
this massive structure here on railroad

941
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,119
tracks takes about an hour and 40

942
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,079
minutes to move in and out so when

943
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,200
they're not using it it sits outside and

944
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,079
basking in the sun with a little bit of

945
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:01,358
water and and when they want it they

946
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,480
roll it in

947
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,480
oh okay so next time you watch a game in

948
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,400
Arizona that's what you get of course

949
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,519
these are good uses for lawn mowers the

950
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,480
redneck riding mower how about

951
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,239
that grass

952
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,719
bike really nice with a grass jacket

953
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:24,719
there the integration of apparel and

954
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,719
functional

955
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:31,679
travel the bug the grass

956
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:34,279
Accord somebody that's probably smoking

957
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,960
some of the grass that using a little

958
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,000
bit of grass dashboard how about a grass

959
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,639
grass board instead of a dashboard grass

960
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,039
on the seats

961
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:48,159
dude how about this take your shoes off

962
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,159
walk on grass all

963
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,400
day and then there's uh one of the more

964
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:58,079
interesting things we tried this past

965
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:00,800
year is the use of grass as a fish

966
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,760
film this is some work that was done a

967
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,200
number of years ago where they took a a

968
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,560
grass canvas literally grew it on burlap

969
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:12,598
which is what we did and then um made it

970
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,679
dark and then exposed the uh this

971
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,280
picture here and then shot the picture

972
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:19,719
on the grass so that it would ultimately

973
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,240
develop the picture right because you'd

974
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:24,959
have different shades of light over the

975
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,519
top of the grass and that the picture

976
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,000
itself would develop over

977
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:35,440
time this is a again a grass canvas with

978
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,358
a overhead projector and a a Plexi

979
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:43,039
plexiglass pan of water dripping down

980
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:45,000
and so you had Stripes uh on the pan and

981
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,759
water dripping in and you could see it

982
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,719
on the grass

983
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,079
canvas here are some pictures uh again

984
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,598
big grass canvas with a picture shown on

985
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,960
it same here this is how it looked one

986
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,318
that looked was developed and here's the

987
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:05,599
one Marsha did in the library uh last

988
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:09,239
year this is uh two sheets of

989
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,960
burlap with Ry grass planted on it

990
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,838
tacked to some

991
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,559
2x4s put together you can see the wood

992
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,679
that's suspending

993
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,719
it and then we took a

994
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,960
projector computer image and shown

995
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,759
Gandhi on it we had this big black box I

996
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,720
don't have a lot of pictures of it I

997
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,119
should have it but I can tell you it was

998
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,318
the talk of the campus for about a two

999
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,838
we period because it had these little

1000
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:39,239
black hole it had these little holes

1001
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:41,920
drilled in this big black draped uh

1002
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:44,439
display that was I don't know I don't

1003
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,639
know how wide was it 12 about 12 by 10

1004
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,200
12 by 10 kids could go up to it and look

1005
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:52,239
and you had all these Gandhi peaceful uh

1006
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,759
sayings all the way around it and

1007
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,759
eventually it we think we need a

1008
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,440
brighter light I think that's one of the

1009
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,000
things it didn't develop as good as we

1010
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,760
liked it did develop a little bit but

1011
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,519
what we wound up doing and I don't have

1012
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,760
the picture of it is one day I went in

1013
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,920
there

1014
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,559
with was who was the woman Christine and

1015
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,079
we kind of brushed it and we used a

1016
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,359
little bit of Lawn Lawn you know lawn

1017
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,839
patterns with the same with the um with

1018
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:22,679
the uh developing of the image on the

1019
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,318
thing as well and after we took it all

1020
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,719
away you could actually see Gandhi's

1021
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:31,079
face which was prettyy cool

1022
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:34,480
so with that as opposed to uh keep off

1023
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,559
the grass my hope is that you know today

1024
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,400
and Beyond this that you go and use

1025
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,720
grass as a way of I don't know

1026
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,960
expressing yourself as it as it's been

1027
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,799
for me uh stretching

1028
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,240
myself here's Fred I can't I want I

1029
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
can't do this without saying thanks to

1030
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,039
Craig if you don't know Craig you'll

1031
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,200
some of you may have him today this is

1032
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:57,039
Craig's dog Fred and there is nothing

1033
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,960
looks as good as a black and white dog

1034
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,519
on a nice green grass with a little bit

1035
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,679
of

1036
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,960
dandel so I hope that you have a

1037
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,519
wonderful day today and I know you will

1038
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,639
have a lot of people out there like

1039
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:12,039
Danielle and Alex and Craig and Mara who

1040
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,039
will be able to answer some of your

1041
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,960
questions but one of the things that I

1042
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,440
like the most about what this invol

1043
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,920
involvement with this has not always

1044
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,200
been that you know it's a way of kind of

1045
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,358
expressing yourself artistically which I

1046
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,799
never knew I had the ability to do any

1047
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,159
of that um but also that it's living in

1048
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,599
sustainable art this is not the kind of

1049
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:37,440
work that has to damage the environment

1050
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,280
any way working with the environment

1051
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,240
it's an easy way to make sustainable art

1052
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,040
that a lot of people can enjoy that you

1053
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,919
don't necessarily have to go to a museum

1054
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,838
to see so my hope is that you have all

1055
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,280
those thoughts when you're doing this

1056
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:52,119
work and really I think you're going to

1057
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,839
have a wonderful day it could be kind of

1058
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,440
sticky hot out there today too but as

1059
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,639
figures after been raining all this time

1060
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,358
do do you have any questions before I

1061
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:06,639
turn it back over to

1062
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:08,719
Mara Felder what kind of grass on the

1063
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,000
jewelry what kind of grass on the

1064
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,039
jewelry you know I don't really know I

1065
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,440
think some of it was Moss but most

1066
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:19,838
likely it's Ry grass because it grows so

1067
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,039
quick it's pretty almost disposable I

1068
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,639
mean it grows on

1069
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:27,279
burlap we grow it on your hat that's not

1070
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:31,719
a bad idea isn't

1071
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:35,400
say no to Grass N I can't say no to

1072
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:40,318
grass so it's no dirt it's

1073
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,800
just grass on yeah grass on burlap right

1074
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,400
just seed it really heavy and whatever

1075
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,200
the hell at

1076
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,079
it it's burlap and then M and I think we

1077
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:54,679
didn't use Pete Moss for the CI thing no

1078
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,440
that was just that was just gr on burlap

1079
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:59,279
I mean burlap has a wall water hole I

1080
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,440
mean it has a structure to hold water

1081
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,160
now there different types of burlap too

1082
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,838
we had a couple layers of burlap we had

1083
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,838
did you have a couple of

1084
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,838
layers yeah go ahead about how long does

1085
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,880
that take to grow a

1086
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:18,759
week it's really amazing just pointing

1087
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,920
out weed it just because you think you

1088
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,760
lay it down evenly and end up with a few

1089
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,800
spots so we had to go back SE a little

1090
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,160
bit more

1091
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,519
water really beautiful just this perfect

1092
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:33,639
in the middle of winter this green block

1093
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:37,119
GR in prepared

1094
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:39,960
the did you grow it on the 2x4s or did

1095
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,720
you tack it on after we we tacked it on

1096
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,318
before you tacked it on before

1097
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:50,039
frame so it'll so the grass will hang on

1098
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,960
a vertical surface it'll stick it Roots

1099
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,199
right to the

1100
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,559
burlap but how do you make it stick

1101
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:58,480
initially a vertical no no no well we

1102
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,240
grow it flat okay got and then we lift

1103
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,599
it and once it gets some structure to it

1104
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:03,519
you mow it once it gets some stru and

1105
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:05,160
that's one one of the things that's

1106
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,679
critical is when you're doing some of

1107
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,279
these things it's really important to

1108
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:11,960
mow the grass a little bit because that

1109
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,119
encourages it to get dense it's somewhat

1110
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,599
counterintuitive but by clipping it it

1111
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,280
gets thicker it causes it to grow more

1112
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,920
laterally as opposed to Growing straight

1113
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,880
up how long did you expose it to the

1114
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,280
overhead projector to get the was it a

1115
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,240
week we need it to get brighter and we

1116
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,720
need we needed a brighter

1117
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:34,318
light yeah this might be kind of stretch

1118
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:36,279
but um the whole idea with green roofs

1119
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,719
is there any way that the grass instead

1120
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:43,280
of siding we can possibly grow grass on

1121
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:45,759
the side of our house

1122
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,960
yes yes I mean it won't live unless you

1123
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,200
give it water now you could you know use

1124
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,039
the you can use warm seedson grasses in

1125
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:55,318
some places where they won't need much

1126
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:57,599
water right um but there's no reason to

1127
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,119
think you couldn't just get established

1128
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,160
on the and attack it to the side of your

1129
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,640
house good or they can make a a matrix

1130
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:07,598
structure of some sort that you could

1131
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,318
use I mean they build straw houses right

1132
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,359
straw bale

1133
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:14,480
houses certainly sod roues are not

1134
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,679
unique they've been doing them forever

1135
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,400
right and the thing that's nice about it

1136
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,318
is you can actually go up there and sit

1137
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,358
as opposed to having SE them that you

1138
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,480
can't touch or it'll

1139
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,960
die it's it can be a little bit

1140
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,639
functional as well which is what the

1141
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,639
idea was at Lincoln

1142
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:35,400
Center yeah we were talking earlier

1143
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,400
about like the picture

1144
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,199
the

1145
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:45,280
mat no I actually think that's um that's

1146
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:48,078
uh structural it's like gravel with soil

1147
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,760
mixed in that they grew grass over the

1148
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,559
top of so it infiltrates it I've seen

1149
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,400
some things in parking yes you do and

1150
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,720
they don't work very good it doesn't I

1151
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,240
don't think so we've tried that a few

1152
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:02,679
times and we haven't found that it works

1153
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:05,838
so good yeah but it's I mean grass I

1154
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:07,199
mean we really have the data now there's

1155
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:08,880
no reason why we can't have grass

1156
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:13,118
parking lots the trick with grass

1157
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:16,480
parking lots is um we think that the tra

1158
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,240
70% of a parking lot are the spaces

1159
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,159
about 30% of the traveling lanes so the

1160
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,519
traveling lanes will be something other

1161
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,199
than grass so we'll make the parking

1162
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,318
spaces grass and then what's critical

1163
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:30,960
is that you

1164
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,759
um that

1165
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,119
you have the spaces on a diagonal

1166
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,040
because what we've learned is when you

1167
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,318
turn on the grass especially when it's

1168
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:43,400
wet you can tear it so you want to be

1169
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:46,159
able to smoothly go in and park the car

1170
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,318
like that but other than that it's just

1171
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:51,759
it's this gravel grass grown on gravel Y

1172
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:54,798
and we watered it for a week when we

1173
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,720
first put it in and we we have done less

1174
00:49:54,798 --> 00:49:58,798
than nothing to

1175
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,519
we've done less I'm not we've done

1176
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:02,039
virtually nothing to it and it's been

1177
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:03,199
there we've had it out there for four

1178
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,239
years we've been driving on it and

1179
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,798
parking on it for four years now so you

1180
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,879
could do that for your driveway

1181
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:12,838
absolutely without question mow with

1182
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,760
though don't you you could mow it but

1183
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:18,838
you don't have to no is there grass that

1184
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,440
grows a determinant height no well yes

1185
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,759
grass will grow to a certain height

1186
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,838
it'll flower if you don't mow it right

1187
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,520
you'll get these wispy seed heads but

1188
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:28,719
you can mow it a little bit so that it

1189
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:32,159
doesn't flow and some grasses grow very

1190
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,159
slowly and then flop

1191
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,720
over so it's a special kind of grass

1192
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,400
that grows on the gravel that you've

1193
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:42,279
developed no we use tall fescue the same

1194
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,280
stuff you're going to sod your things

1195
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,960
with today really yeah I'm telling you

1196
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,079
do I sound intelligent I'm telling you

1197
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,760
you don't have to be smart to do this

1198
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,359
this is as easy as it

1199
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,440
gets I mean just a little sea a little

1200
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:57,440
water and you got it

1201
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,199
thanks very much I hope you have a great

1202
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,559
day
