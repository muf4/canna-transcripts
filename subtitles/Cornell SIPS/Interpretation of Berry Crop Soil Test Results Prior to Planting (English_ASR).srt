00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,400
person with their hand raised there's

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,799
several things that you can do you can

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,118
agree or disagree raise your hand to

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,799
indicate you have a question ask someone

34
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,920
to speak louder or softer to speed up to

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,640
slow down to laugh to applaud and all of

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,759
those little icons will show up next to

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,759
your name in the attendees

38
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,200
box on the bottom left hand side of the

39
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,239
screen you'll see some web links

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,159
Northeast s has its own website and it

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,438
has a link there uh Cornell fre fruit

42
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,920
resources berries is also there and then

43
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,239
at the bottom are the webinar archives

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,599
if you've missed any of the webinars in

45
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,078
the series they are recorded and you can

46
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,038
listen to the any you've missed by going

47
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,079
to that

48
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,360
link okay we're ready to start our

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
speaker for this week is Dr Marvin pritz

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,200
professor and chair of the Department of

51

horticulture at Cornell University and

52
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,598
our topic is soil nutrient management

53
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,199
he's going to discuss correction of soil

54
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,079
problems application technology

55
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,199
conventional nutrient sources organic

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,560
nutrient

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,199
sources oh I'm sorry that's next week's

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,598
topic lyming and pH reduction so now you

59
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,598
know what will be studying next

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,800
week Marvin was born in southwestern

61
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,679
Pennsylvania and got his BS in biology

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,480
from Bucknell and his Ms in biology from

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,319
the University of South Carolina he got

64
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,039
his PhD in Horticulture at Michigan

65
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,079
State University working with wild

66
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,959
species of blueberries he came to

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,879
Cornell in 1984 as the berry crop

68
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,479
specialist with an appointment in

69

and has consulted with berry Farmers

74
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,598
throughout the world he became chairman

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,920
Marvin thank you Kathy and welcome all

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,319
of you to the webinar it's a beautiful

84
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
here in New York I hope it's nice for

85
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,518
you are as well uh what we want to do

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,479
today is talk about how to interpret

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,599
soil tests and the soil tests as we

88
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,639
mentioned before in previous webinars

89
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,238
are used before planting that's where

90
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,759
we're primarily uh using our soil tests

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,920
and the goal of soil testing just to

92
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,078
refresh is to estimate the plant

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,039
available nutrient levels in the soil

94
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,480
soil tests do not tell you how much of a

95
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,400
particular nutrient is in the soil they

96
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,199
estimate how much of a particular

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,879
nutrient ENT in the soil is available to

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,518
the plant so the

99
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:10,359
extractant sort of mimics what a plant

100
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,879
root might have available to them and

101
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,200
since you can't you mimic that perfectly

102
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,358
people have come up with these different

103
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,478
extractants to try to imitate what a

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,519
plant root might be able to extract from

105
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,918
the

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,439
soil once those values are obtained then

107
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,959
a recommendation is made uh to bring

108
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,000
those levels up to some Optimum because

109
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,638
we don't want soil nutrients to be

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,038
limiting typically plants respond to

111
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,918
soil nutrients uh in a curve that sort

112
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,240
of looks like a you know it's you get a

113
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,439
rapid response at low levels but as you

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,680
get up further on the curve the response

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
that more and more nutrients begins to

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,759
level out to where you don't get a

117
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,198
response at

118
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,280
all and the goal of soil nutrient

119
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,600
testing is to somewhat build up the soil

120
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,879
nutrient back so that there's never a

121
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,919
risk of nutrients being

122
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,600
limited but there are some philosophies

123
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,879
of soil testing where you want to just

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,639
apply enough to where the economic gain

125
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,639
from an additional amendment is equal to

126
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,240
the cost of the added Amendment so let

127
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,240
me maybe try to show you that

128
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,599
graphically in some philosophies you

129
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,079
want to try to be right here on the

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,759
curve where you're just starting to see

131
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,240
a a decrease in the response other

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
philosophies say well we want to be up

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
here because we don't ever want to be in

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,400
a situation where we want to be in a

135
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,080
deficient condition and different soils

136
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,638
Labs sort of give you recommendations

137
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,758
based on that philosophy and probably

138
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,439
not surprisingly soils Labs that also

139
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,879
sell fertilizers tend to be up here at

140
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:52,519
the top end and University labs and all

141
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,120
tend to want to be down here it's a

142
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,799
little bit harder with perennial crops

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
to be in this range here where the Green

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,759
Arrow is poting out because we don't

145
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
often have have a chance to go back in

146
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,600
annually and add a little bit of

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,080
nutrient to bring us up to where we need

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,400
so if you look at recommendations for

149
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,359
annual crops they'll often be down in

150
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,038
this range with berry crops and

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,160
perennial crops we tend to have to find

152
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,800
a happy medium between here and up here

153
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,439
because we can't go in annually and

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,639
replenish very

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,240
well so the ideal somewhere between do

156
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,519
we just can't go in and incorporate the

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,478
amount of nutrients we need after u a

158
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,959
year is up

159
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,399
so except for Sandy soils the eventual

160
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,079
nutrient Supply which is how much is in

161
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,439
the soil plus how much we add as

162
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,240
fertilizer should be sufficient for the

163
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,199
life expectancy of the planting and this

164
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,639
would be looking at you know maybe 5

165
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,598
years or strawberries maybe 10 to 15 for

166
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,079
raspberries without having to come back

167
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,439
in and annually apply phosphorus

168
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,159
potassium and magnesium calcium and so

169
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,719
forth of course nitrogen we do apply

170
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,120
that annually but that's very solid and

171
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,280
it can get out into the root Zone very

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,199
quickly these other nutrients phosphorus

173
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,799
in particular very difficult to move

174
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,759
through the soil profile so we need to

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,240
have that incorporated before we plant

176
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,960
that's why we have to maybe build up a

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,038
little bit of a bank particularly for

178
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,439
longer lived crops like raspberries and

179
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,439
particularly

180
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,520
blueberries so whenever these soil tests

181
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,598
are done and recommendations come out

182
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,079
every soil is probably going to give you

183
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:35,079
a slightly different response curve to

184
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,439
the crop of interest and we can't

185
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,318
develop response curves for every soil

186
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,319
type in your state uh so we have to make

187
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,520
some

188
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,479
generalizations and also the truth of

189
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,478
the matter is these response curves have

190
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,839
not been developed for strawberries and

191
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,878
raspberries and blueberries on all

192
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,560
different soil types uh often times the

193
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,120
agronomists have done these things for

194
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,598
field crops but not so much for food

195
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,319
crops so guess the point here is that

196
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,079
we're making educated guesses about how

197
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,520
Berry crops respond often based on the

198
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,359
response to some of these agronomic

199
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,918
crops we know a little bit more about a

200
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,800
one approach that's often used is to

201
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,758
find an agronomic crop that has a

202
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,319
similar response to a fruit crop where

203
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,919
there's a lot more data for and use that

204
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,360
as sort of a foundation for some of the

205
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,598
soil testing recommendations then a good

206
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,000
example would be alala which tends to

207
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,279
have the same sort of a response to

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,079
nutrients in the soil and soil types

209
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,759
says do strawberries and raspberries you

210
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,918
know Alpha Alphas are perennial

211
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,759
strawberries and raspberries are

212
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,199
perennial they have about the same

213
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,559
rooting depth they have the same pH

214
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,919
requirement for soil for optimal growth

215
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,559
so those are oftentimes used as a basis

216
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,679
for

217
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,159
recommendation of course people do

218
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,439
nutrient response curves for some of

219
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,719
these and this is an example actually

220
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,720
from Strawberry and this is looking at

221
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,720
nitrogen and these are looking at

222
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,879
various rates of nitrogen uh fertilizer

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,160
on PL plants and this is in a this is in

224
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,200
a liquid form so it's not quite easily

225
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:09,199
to convert to pounds per acre but the

226
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,399
point is at low nutrient levels you

227
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,399
don't get much of a response but as you

228
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,759
move up you get a higher higher response

229
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,759
but then the curve kind of flattens

230
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,838
out if we look at Leaf area we fertilize

231
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:25,120
with more and more nitrogen you know the

232
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,480
leaves love it and they really expand a

233
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,560
lot and grow a lot but if we look at

234
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,320
yield it's not nearly is

235
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,518
responsive to the increases in nitrogen

236
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,120
so that says okay the optimal rate is

237
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,039
probably somewhere around this uh 10n

238
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,919
situation here so we can do these

239
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,078
response curves to some extent and sort

240
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:50,240
of calibrate our soil test by

241
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,519
that so it's not that they don't exist

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,839
for Berry crops it's just that there's

243
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,278
not a lot of those out there to

244
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,279
calibrate

245
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,480
on some recommendations are based on

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,040
response curves that are dependent on

247
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,000
the soil type in other words to get a

248
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,319
good recommendation you have to input

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,078
the soil type so then the software knows

250
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,079
what soil type that is and can make a

251
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,359
recommendation based on that uh a Morgan

252
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:20,519
extracting is a good example of a type

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,800
of soil test that is you have to have

254
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,200
the soil type or at least know whether

255
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:29,838
it's a a Sandy LOM or a LOM or a silt or

256
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,800
a clay because the response curve and

257
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,600
the extracting is based on that soil

258
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,399
type you have many labs are getting away

259
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,360
from those tests that are dependent on

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,399
soil type and looking at other tests

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,240
that that's less important and the

262
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,399
modified Morgan is one of those tests

263
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,159
that is a little bit less dependent on

264
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,440
knowing the type of soil that you have

265
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,240
in there and a lot of this is due to the

266
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,839
amount of potassium that the different

267
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,839
extractants pull out of the

268
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,399
soil but you have to sort of assume that

269
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,440
this soil tests that you're using the

270
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,480
procedures and all are are good and

271
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,880
accurate and that the recommendations

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,680
come out are on target now a question

273
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,200
was asked like a a week or so ago about

274
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,199
organic versus conventional

275
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,360
recommendations the recommendations that

276
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,600
come out should be mostly the same

277
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,000
whether one's organic or conventional

278
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,680
it's not what's recommended that should

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,200
be different it's the

280
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:31,719
amount and the type of product that's

281
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,320
used that's different so a soil test

282
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,160
might recommend you know 50 pounds of

283
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,800
potassium but the source of that

284
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:43,039
potassium is what would differ then

285
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,120
between the organic and the conventional

286
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,278
grower there is some difference in

287
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,879
amount based on release rate some

288
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,039
organic nutrients are a little bit more

289
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,559
slower to release their nutrients so you

290
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,519
may have to apply more of that uh

291
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,679
because the release rate slower but in

292
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,959
general it's the total amount would be

293
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,958
the same

294
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,720
so when you get your soil test the most

295
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,480
important adjustment that we usually

296
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,360
make is to soil

297
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,920
PH if the soil PH isn't within the

298
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,360
desired range then the ability to take

299
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,078
up nutrients will be compromised so if

300
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
you don't have the pH right you can put

301
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:21,638
on a lot of a certain nutrient and it

302
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,320
might not even get into the plant

303
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,320
because of the ph and you probably all

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,278
seen this in soils classes back in

305
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,040
college but the amount of nutrient

306
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,679
that's available to the plant is very

307
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,719
dependent on soil PH and the optimal

308
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,719
range for most crops is a little bit

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,440
less than six up to about

310
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,440
6.5 and of course you all know

311
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,880
blueberries are the exception they're

312
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,360
down around 4.5 for the optimum but for

313
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,439
most of the plants that we're dealing

314
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,519
with with the berries and even vegetable

315
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,839
crops it's up around 6 to 6.5 because of

316
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,839
that range most of the nutrients are

317
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,839
reasonably available to the

318
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
plant

319
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:08,278
now if we have to make an adjustment to

320
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:10,919
the pH we use sulfur to lower it and

321
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:14,000
lime to raise

322
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,919
it often times in cataloges and

323
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
particular for homeowners you'll see U

324
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,278
aluminum sulfate recommended to lower

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,198
the ph and we do not recommend that

326
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,879
because aluminum is toxic to plants at

327
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,399
high rates now granted it provides a

328
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,919
rapid change in PH because because the

329
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,639
sulfur is already oxidized when it's in

330
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,838
aluminum sulfate form so it could go

331
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,039
right to work and lower that pH almost

332
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,839
right away whereas sulfur takes some

333
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,919
time but you don't want all that

334
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,959
aluminum so we don't recommend that for

335
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,599
lowering

336
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,638
pH and changing the soil PH after

337
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,240
planting is extremely slow and difficult

338
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,278
that's why it's so important to do it

339
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,079
before planting I have a couple of

340
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,278
photos here of people who have planted

341
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,359
and then realize that their pH is too

342
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,958
low

343
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,560
and tried to raise it with lime and you

344
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,119
can see it just makes a real mess in the

345
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,239
field it's really hard to incorporate

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,759
and get that lime down into the root

347
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,440
Zone where it has an impact so if you

348
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,639
can mix it in the soil before you plant

349
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,120
it just makes a world difference um

350
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,039
raspberry field same way how are you

351
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,039
going to work that line down into the

352
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,719
soil well enough to really change the pH

353
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,240
around the root Zone where those nuts

354
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,680
can be taken up better it's really hard

355
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,680
to do

356
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,679
that

357
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,440
so the amount of lime that you're going

358
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,480
to apply to the soil the change the pH

359
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,279
is dependent on two things and one is

360
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,839
the difference between the current pH

361
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,198
and your target pH so how big is a gap

362
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,880
between where you want to be and where

363
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,639
you currently are and then the second

364
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,360
thing is something called a c Caton

365
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,600
exchange capacity or the soil buffering

366
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,839
capacity this is the ability of the soil

367
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,639
to hold on to the catons in the soil

368
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,720
through these exchange sites they're

369
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,039
like negative charges on the soil

370
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,320
particles and it's the ratio of the cats

371
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,319
that are bound to these negative

372
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,320
charges uh

373
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,399
to charges that only have hydrogen

374
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,120
attached to them it's the ratio of the

375
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,360
cat to the hydrogen ions to determine

376
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,360
your

377
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,799
pH this is often called base saturation

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,440
or the percent of the exchange sites

379
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,799
occupied by the bases so just think of

380
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,040
it as a like a column the column has a

381
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,479
lot of NE of negative charges on it some

382
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,679
of those charges then attached to

383
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,278
positively charged cat such as calcium

384
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,758
magnesium and potassium those are the

385
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,639
major ones the remainder uh tend to be

386
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,959
populated with hydrogen ions and the

387
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,759
more hydrogen ions you have the lower

388
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,838
your pH remember pH is the negative log

389
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,240
of the hydrogen content or something

390
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,959
like that anyway um the higher the ratio

391
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,399
of the hydrogen ions to cations the more

392
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,119
acid to

393
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,000
soil so the more of these exchange sites

394
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,959
we have and if we want to change it and

395
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,839
knock some of those hydrogens off the

396
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,838
exchange site we have to add a lot more

397
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:22,599
base the negative charges on our soils

398
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,519
arise from either clay particles or

399
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,800
organic matter those are the sources of

400
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,440
the negative charges so the clay

401
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,399
particles and organic matter hold on to

402
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,000
those positive charges that are out

403
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,679
there SS that have a lot of exchange

404
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,679
capacity in other words they have a a

405
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,120
lot of negative charges are more

406
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,239
difficult to adjust the pH so if you

407
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,959
want to knock hydrogen ions off that

408
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,680
exchange sites you have to use a lot of

409
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:53,039
of line but once you make that

410
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,078
adjustment soils that are high and C

411
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
exchange capacity tend to be more stable

412
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,000
they a lot more resistant to change once

413
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,799
you make the change

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,838
so those are low are easy to change but

415
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,119
they'll revert back to a low PH as those

416
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,599
calcium and magnesium and potassium ions

417
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,279
Leech from the soil and then the

418
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,279
hydrogen takes over those exchange sites

419
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,279
and the pH drops

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,279
again so to reiterate it's easy to raise

421
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,678
the pH of a sandy soil with low organic

422
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,960
matter because Sandy soils and low

423
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,480
organic soils have low cat Exchange

424
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,200
capacities conversely it's hard to lower

425
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,279
the pH of a clay soil having a h organic

426
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,679
matter content because both clay and

427
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,798
organic matter contribute to these

428
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,798
negative charges in the

429
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,079
soil so the amount of sulfur this is

430
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,038
just estimates ballpark estimates to

431
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,678
lower the ph to a desired level of

432
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:57,119
4.5 depends the two things we mentioned

433
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,400
it depends on the current pH which is

434
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,399
over here

435
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,279
and of course the further we are from

436
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,519
4.5 which is our Target pH the more

437
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,798
sulfur it will take to lower it and the

438
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,839
higher our Canon exchange capacity the

439
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:19,200
more sulfur it will take to lower it so

440
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,879
in a sandy

441
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,720
soil not much lomy soil with more

442
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,000
negative charges higher cat exchange

443
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,038
capacity it takes more sulfur and with

444
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,480
Clays even more sulfur so when we're up

445
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,158
in this range here with a high pH soil

446
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,519
with heavy soil it's really really hard

447
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,200
to lower that pH uh to 4.5 even with a

448
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,240
lot of sulfur it just takes a huge

449
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,880
amount so often times soils up in here

450
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,880
aren't really suitable for blueberry

451
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,240
production so soil tests attempt to

452
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,880
estimate the amount of lime or sulur

453
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,519
required to bring the pH to within the

454
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,640
desired range for a particular crop and

455
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,599
it's based on this kind exchange

456
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,759
capacity soil tests do not measure Caton

457
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,000
exchange capacity directly in other

458
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,279
words it doesn't go in and directly

459
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,839
measure the amount of negative uh

460
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,240
charges of there and how many of those

461
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,199
negative charges are populated by

462
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,480
hydrogen ions they use indirect methods

463
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,558
to measure that it's an inexact science

464
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
different procedures are used in

465
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,000
different labs and a can exchange

466
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,360
capacity itself varies somewhat with ph

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,200
and other factors so guess what I'm

468
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,599
trying to say here is that often times

469
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,960
the lime recommendations we think of

470
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,719
them as being really really precise but

471
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,519
the truth of the matter is they're

472
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,038
estimates they try to put you in the

473
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:45,839
ballpark but they're not absolutely

474
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,679
precise the Canon exchange capacity

475
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,519
varies with various

476
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,919
soils Sands of course have low and loms

477
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,720
a little bit higher and Clays have

478
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,679
higher and you can see that reflected in

479
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,480
the sulfur recommendations in the

480
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,200
previous table humus or organ oric

481
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,919
matter and it's sort of broken down form

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,960
has very very high cat exchange capacity

483
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,038
so that's why soils high in organic

484
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,200
matter require a lot of sulfur or lime

485
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,200
to make adjustments to

486
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,319
them and we don't want to forget that

487
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,840
adding lime or sulfur to the soil does

488
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:24,158
not change the pH instantly it takes six

489
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,599
months or longer usually it's dependent

490
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,799
on the size of the particle of the lime

491
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,199
and the sulfur small smaller particle

492
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:36,200
sizes adjust more quickly depends on

493
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,319
soil moisture in dry soils you get very

494
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,600
little very slow oxidation conversion

495
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,079
takes a lot of time you have to have

496
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,158
adequate slow moisture to make sure it

497
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,918
happens relatively quickly and in

498
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,200
temperature in the winter time not much

499
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,159
happens in the soil that process of

500
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,038
oxidation is a biological process it

501
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,520
requires soil bacteria to make that

502
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,359
conversion so when it's cold there's not

503
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,960
a lot of activity also those bacteria

504
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,158
have to have Iration it's an aerobic

505
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,720
process and the soil has to be aerated

506
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,480
so all those things have to happen for

507
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,679
that pH to change after we add our lime

508
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,679
or

509
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,360
sulfate so now let's get into the Crux

510
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,919
of the matter here with that background

511
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,319
an interpreting soil test we're going to

512
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,840
look at soil

513
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,879
PH the macronutrients and micronutrients

514
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,439
and I'm going to run through seven or

515
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,679
eight examples and we'll work through

516
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:34,240
those and see how a soil test um might

517
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,919
interpret those and recommend those this

518
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,038
is just an example of a a soil test

519
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,360
we'll look at some of its various parts

520
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,720
the of course the reports that come back

521
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,759
vary a lot from Lab to lab but this just

522
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,960
assume this is sort of a general

523
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,879
recommendation the first thing you want

524
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,038
to look for at least I do is the

525
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,480
ph and we want to look and see whether

526
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,960
that's within the ballark range or not

527
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,079
and in this case here is for

528
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,600
strawberries the PH range that we use

529
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,439
before we provide a line recommendations

530
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,439
is between like 6 and 68 so the pH is

531
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,360
within that range so we wouldn't

532
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
recommend lme

533
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:15,158
here sometimes uh you'll see a different

534
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,520
pH number there and in this case here uh

535
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,919
there's this thing called buffer pH in

536
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,839
water and people say what is that does

537
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,960
that mean my pH is too low because it's

538
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,639
less than six well no in this case here

539
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,840
this soil testing lab is using something

540
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,400
called the buffer pH to estimate cat and

541
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,038
exchange capacity and the difference

542
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,440
between the buffer pH and the normal pH

543
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,359
in water is an estimate of the cat on

544
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,080
Exchange capacity and there's

545
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,439
complicated curves and correlations and

546
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,399
so forth but suffice it to say that the

547
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,320
greater the difference between the ph

548
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,559
and a buffer pH the greater the Caton

549
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,879
exchange capacity therefore the slower

550
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:54,720
or harder it's going to be to change

551
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,039
that pH if you had to change it this

552
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,600
case here we wouldn't have to change it

553
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:02,558
but the situation where the buffer pH

554
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,000
differ greatly from the pH in water that

555
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,440
would imply a high cat exchange capacity

556
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,359
so we don't worry about that for

557
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,759
interpretation we assume that the

558
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,519
software takes that into account and

559
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,359
spits out that line or software

560
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,798
recommendation based on that difference

561
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,000
and we don't have to worry about it but

562
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,278
it's often shown there uh so you can see

563
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
that it's there and it gives you just

564
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:25,599
some sense of when you're comparing

565
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,519
different soils what that cat exchange

566
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,639
capacity difference is if it doesn't

567
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,000
print it out directly on the form some

568
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,440
soil tests printed out directly this one

569
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,319
prints out that buffer pH to pH

570
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,640
comparison other thing I like to look at

571
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,678
is the organic matter content I like to

572
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,679
see organic matters you know 2% or

573
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,679
higher this one's pretty good

574
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:50,200
4.6% it indicates that this cat exchange

575
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,640
capacity is reasonably robust and

576
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,798
there's organic matter in the soil and

577
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,400
the plant roots tend to like that so

578
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,639
when the organic matter gets below 2%

579
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,480
then one of the things you would think

580
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,440
about recommending to a grower would be

581
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,319
some sort of a cover crop or manure

582
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
application or something to boost that

583
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,079
organic matter

584
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,520
content soil tests generally report

585
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,880
values for phosphorus potassium calcium

586
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,079
and magnesium we talked about those

587
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,000
curves before those response curves it's

588
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,599
usually they've been done for these four

589
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,200
macronutrients and not for the

590
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,798
micronutrients those are the ones you're

591
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,720
going to get results from

592
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:35,079
often times these micronutrients will be

593
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,240
printed out but they're kind of hard to

594
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,960
interpret um the techniques that are

595
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,359
used to analyze nutrients are often

596
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,480
times something called an

597
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,879
ICP they send the extractor through that

598
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,919
ICP and it prints out not only the PK

599
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,559
calcium magnesium but it prints out

600
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,240
everything else too so it's not unusual

601
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:58,480
to see a soil testing lab present

602
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,720
present values for zinc and manganese

603
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,919
and

604
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,679
iron even aluminum most of the time

605
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,799
these aren't really very useful like we

606
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,360
don't use those for guidance and what to

607
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,000
apply to the soil usually we use these

608
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,079
when we want to try to diagnose a

609
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,398
problem like a toxicity or some sort of

610
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,000
an imbalance that they're typically not

611
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:20,759
used to give recommendations on those

612
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,640
are usually just PK calcium magnesium

613
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,919
and any sort of pH adjustment Marvin we

614
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,399
also might see yes I'm sorry I didn't

615
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,159
mean to interrupt Jeff Jeff had a

616
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:33,319
question about pH when you're finished

617
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,320
with what you're discussing okay let me

618
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,599
read so the question is do we assume a

619
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
natural reduction in PH over time and

620
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:44,759
therefore apply lme to maintain a pH in

621
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,440
a range of that over a 5year period we P

622
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,000
so with normal rainfall conditions and

623
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,558
all we lose maybe you know 500 pounds of

624
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,919
catons from the typical soil a year so

625
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,879
if you have a lot of calcium in your

626
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,559
soil or potassium and so forth we lose

627
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,159
some of it but it might not be enough to

628
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,960
really knock the PH down even over a

629
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,840
5year period the time when we have to

630
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,079
worry about that is on Sandy soils where

631
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,199
we can't really build up the reserve too

632
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:15,000
much without pushing a pH too high so if

633
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,038
we puts the pH to 6.5 and we have a

634
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,599
sandy soil and we get a lot of rain year

635
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:22,000
after year after year yeah it's true we

636
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,319
could knock the pH Down Below a

637
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,440
desirable level and then we might have

638
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,720
to go back in and reapply but as I

639
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,000
showed earlier it's really difficult to

640
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,440
do that in something like raspberries

641
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,398
because they might live longer than 5

642
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,320
years strawberries you just wait till

643
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:37,398
the end of their normal life and reapply

644
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,599
the line but on raspberries it's kind of

645
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,038
hard to do that so we want to try to

646
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,278
make sure we get all that in there

647
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:47,558
before we plant so we don't have to go

648
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,558
back in and try to add later

649
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,120
on I wanted to mention that

650
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:57,439
the nitrates uh some soil testing Labs

651
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,839
present a value for nitrate but really

652
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,240
is is so variable almost from dayto day

653
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,319
it's not a very useful guideline for

654
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,880
making

655
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,278
recommendations so uh this lab here

656
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
doesn't even print it although they

657
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:14,919
would have it if you would ask for

658
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,960
it the other value we sometimes ask

659
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,559
Growers or to run or make requests for

660
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,360
is boron Boron is one of those

661
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,599
micronutrients that can have an impact

662
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,759
on plant growth and those values do mean

663
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,359
something so we will uh recommend it

664
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,640
Growers particularly of strawberries and

665
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,599
raspberries ask for Boron if it doesn't

666
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,038
automatically come with the test

667
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,038
sometimes it does sometimes it

668
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,519
doesn't this is just a diagram of the

669
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,879
different forms of nitrogen and the

670
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,079
different cycles that are happening

671
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,760
within nitrogen and it's just so

672
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:52,278
variable that anytime you do a nitrate

673
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,038
or a nitrogen test of the soil it's just

674
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:56,960
a snapshot in time it's so Dynamic that

675
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,558
those numbers really don't mean anything

676
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,000
so we don't pay much attention to them

677
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,798
when we get them Boron on the other hand

678
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,720
I mentioned is a an important nutrient

679
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,798
it's important for cell elongation and

680
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,240
if you don't have Boron your cells tend

681
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,759
not to elongate very well and so this is

682
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,679
a root of a strawberry plant grown in a

683
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,519
nutrient solution is complete has

684
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,679
everything in it the next slide I'm

685
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,319
going to show you is one where the Boron

686
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,200
was removed from the nutrient solution

687
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,639
and you can see how that roots are real

688
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,080
stubby and of course a plant without

689
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,640
boron has a difficult time taking up all

690
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,678
the other nutrients that it needs that's

691
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,919
why we want to make sure we have

692
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,519
adequate boron in the soil so you don't

693
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,960
get a situation like this where the soil

694
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,839
tests will show well you got adequate

695
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,519
potassium and phosphorus and magnesium

696
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,199
and calcium but the plants are showing

697
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,919
deficiencies in those values well it

698
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,720
might not be too low of potassium or too

699
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,080
low of phosphorus it might be that your

700
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,000
Boron is inadequate that's why we want

701
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,000
to look at that particular

702
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,439
nutrient okay back to the soil test the

703
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,119
other thing we want to look for is a

704
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,558
type of test that we've run in this case

705
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,518
here it was modified

706
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:11,278
Morgan but different Labs run different

707
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,960
tests so when you get the values under

708
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,038
there they don't really mean a whole lot

709
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,880
if somebody sends me values of a soil

710
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,558
test um I don't really have any basis

711
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,320
for knowing what's low medium and high

712
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:26,480
you have to trust that the soil testing

713
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:29,319
lab knows what low medium high is for

714
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,319
your particular CR

715
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,558
so here we have recommendations on what

716
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,000
low medium high is and again because

717
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,839
different Labs use different methods

718
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,079
different extractions you got to trust

719
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,678
that they know what they're doing

720
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,720
now and then you get your

721
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,159
recommendations printed out down here

722
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,159
based on the soil test levels

723
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,960
above mentioned you have to have

724
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,200
confidence in the recommendations

725
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,079
provided by your lab the best analysis

726
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,480
in the world is useless without a good

727
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:04,000
recommendation unfortunately many

728
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,798
analytical labs provide these General

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,919
plant recommendations that are good for

730
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,639
fi crops but they don't really fine-tune

731
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,120
them to the needs of the specific crops

732
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,559
that we might be interested in like

733
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,398
strawberries like raspberries and I

734
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,918
can't tell you how many times I've seen

735
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:20,199
soil tests come back for blueberries and

736
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,240
the recommendations look like they

737
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,480
should have been for corn or something

738
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,759
because the lab has just spitting out a

739
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,798
general recommendation for Gen crop on

740
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,919
that soil without understanding the

741
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,519
differences between these perennial

742
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,120
crops and some of the crops that require

743
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,120
a low PH so just a word of warning on

744
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,719
that you've got to trust that the lab

745
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,278
knows what they're

746
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,480
doing Marvin Jeff had a question on

747
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,440
Boron is it Mobile in the soil Boron is

748
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,000
very Mobile in the soil that's one of

749
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,440
those nutrients that you can come in and

750
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,558
apply any time of the year and you can

751
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,639
apply it right to the soil surface even

752
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:00,119
right over the leaves and it'll wash

753
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,959
into the soil and get taken up by the

754
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,918
roots and into the plant so that's one

755
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,319
that's fairly easy to correct uh even

756
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,480
after the plants are in the ground it's

757
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,960
not like some of the other nutrients

758
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
that are very difficult to move into the

759
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,240
root

760
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,639
zone

761
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,480
so let's look at a few examples here and

762
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,918
see what we can come up with this is a

763
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,319
example of a soil test strawberries on a

764
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,720
clay LOM soil

765
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,240
and we're going to trust that the lab

766
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,679
gives us the right values for what's low

767
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,319
medium high and they're reporting these

768
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,600
out uh medium phosphorus high potassium

769
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:44,200
high calcium low

770
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:47,278
magnesium boron has more than one pound

771
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:52,120
and a pH of 5.2 relatively High organic

772
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:54,240
matter so what do you think a soil test

773
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,278
recommendation might provide for this

774
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,558
particular example give you a second so

775
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,558
look at that maybe you might want to jot

776
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,918
that down somewhere and see what you can

777
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:03,918
come up

778
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:13,278
with so the first thing I would do

779
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,600
without knowing anything about the lab

780
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,359
really extract or anything is look at

781
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,558
the

782
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:23,558
ph and I see oh it's 5.2 so it's less

783
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:26,678
than the six or 6.2 to 65 that we would

784
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:30,000
ideally want for strawberri so I would

785
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,360
know that some sort of a pH modification

786
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,638
is in line

787
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:37,240
here I also would look here and and see

788
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:39,398
that phosphorus is a little bit low we

789
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,960
might want to raise that a little

790
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:46,479
bit I also know that a lime contains

791
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,360
Calcium but it also contains

792
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,720
magnesium now in this case magnesium is

793
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:55,519
low so one option I would have in this

794
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,600
case and the recommendation engine

795
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,599
should generate this is when they're

796
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:04,439
recommending a pH change they might want

797
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,839
to recommend high magnesium lime so you

798
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,639
can raise the ph and provide your

799
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,638
magnesium in the same

800
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,240
step so here the recommendation would be

801
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,519
damic line because it has high magnesium

802
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,519
and

803
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,360
phosphorus Arvin Glenn had a question

804
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,440
without n represented on the soil test

805
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,119
what is the basis for the N recommend

806
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,120
ation I'm glad you uh asked that

807
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,439
question the basis for the nitrogen

808
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:38,319
recommendation is sort of a ballpark

809
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,679
figure of what you would apply to a crop

810
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,519
in that particular year so for example

811
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,120
strawberries a standard recommendation

812
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,720
would be anywhere from 70 to 100 pounds

813
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,719
of nitrogen per acre just based on the

814
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,440
age of the plant based on the crop

815
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,440
itself we always have to add nitrogen

816
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,960
every year and that's sort of a standard

817
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,759
so it's not based on the soil test that

818
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,519
nitrogen recommendation is just sort of

819
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,278
a standard practice that a grower would

820
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,200
use um to fertilize to put you in the

821
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,878
ballpark we're going to talk in a couple

822
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,119
of weeks about using folar

823
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:13,838
analysis and one of the most important

824
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,039
uses of foler analysis is to adjust

825
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,519
those ballp part nitrogen

826
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,599
recommendations to fit your particular

827
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,159
crop

828
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,960
situation so the recommendation might

829
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,800
say well an established strawberry field

830
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,878
you know 100 pounds of nitrogen but we

831
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,839
can use that Fuller test to adjust that

832
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,358
up or down based on what the values are

833
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,039
in the leaves we'll talk about that

834
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,960
later so the recommendation of nitrogen

835
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:39,079
on a soil test for a perennial crop is

836
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,000
just ballpark figure this is what you

837
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,000
typically do the first year of the

838
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,720
planting Sonia is commenting that low

839
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,440
magnesium can also be exacerbated by

840
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,799
high potassium because they compete for

841
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,720
uptake

842
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,519
correct there is some uh item some

843
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,838
thinking that that can indeed happen

844
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:03,480
there's competition between these catons

845
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,799
for exchange sites so uh in soils that

846
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,280
are really really high in one of the

847
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,519
catons and really really low in the

848
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,320
other there's some sense that the high

849
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:18,199
catons can suppress the uptake of the

850
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,640
lower level of the catons in in low

851
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,039
Supply so yeah those situations are

852
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,319
pretty rare but they can happen and I'm

853
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,800
actually going to give you an example of

854
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,838
this in a few

855
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,599
minutes Dan is wondering on some of the

856
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,320
high lime soils in central New York

857
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,599
where the pH values can be closer to

858
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,800
seven if an application of sulfur should

859
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,760
be made to lower the pH for

860
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,160
strawberries I would say sure certainly

861
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,520
our Target pH would be you know 62 to 65

862
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:46,920
for strawberries and if you're up at

863
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,759
seven and you're in a pre-plant

864
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,039
situation I think softare would be uh an

865
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,920
appropriate material to apply to lower

866
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,079
that a little bit so that the nutrient

867
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,240
uptake can be improved and you get less

868
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,400
um precipitation form between some of

869
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:04,679
these nutrients that happen at high phes

870
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,680
where they become unavailable to the

871
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,679
plant

872
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,280
right let's look at a second example

873
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:18,159
this is blueberries on a Sandy LOM

874
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,079
soil and we have low

875
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,000
calcium we

876
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,560
have pH is just about right High organic

877
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,480
matter

878
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,480
so uh

879
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,838
what would we do in this situation here

880
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,079
potassium is high phosphorus is high

881
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,440
magnesium is

882
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,160
high we need it looks like we need

883
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,400
calcium but the pH is already kind of

884
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,078
where we want it we don't really want to

885
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,599
raise the calcium too much more what

886
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,599
would we do

887
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,160
here so in this case we might recommend

888
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,720
calcium sulfate instead of lime to

889
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,440
provide our calcium because calcium

890
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,799
sulfate doesn't change the pH very much

891
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,240
when it's added so it's a way of

892
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,160
providing calcium without a big change

893
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,959
in PH so again the soil test

894
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,639
recommendation should know that take

895
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,639
that into account whenever it makes the

896
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:14,399
recommendation so I see Jeff okay yeah

897
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,039
go ahead oh no I just gonna say Jeff had

898
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,039
a question about

899
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,838
sulfur yeah requirements for

900
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,159
strawberries yeah sulfur is needed by

901
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,400
alala but it's also needed for all other

902
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,399
crops as well so an essential nutrient

903
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,920
is part of amino acids so all plants

904
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,800
need sulfur and in our part of the world

905
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,680
sulfur is rarely limiting it comes down

906
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,359
in rainfall acid rain and there's

907
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,358
usually plenty of sulfur it's rare that

908
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,838
you have to add sulfur for the nutrient

909
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:46,078
value to the plant we might add sulfur

910
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,078
for the pH adjustment but usually not

911
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,160
for the nutrient value again there

912
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,560
sulfur around it's in the organic matter

913
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,118
there usually we're not in situations

914
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,599
here where we're usually very sulfur

915
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,599
deficient at least not in

916
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,079
crops take a third example raspberries

917
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,559
lomy soil here we're high and everything

918
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,440
the pH is Right would the soil test

919
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,440
recommend anything

920
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,318
here well it might and this goes back to

921
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,560
what Sonia asked about earlier sometimes

922
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,719
even though we have high values if we're

923
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,920
really super high in one nutrient one C

924
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,959
in particular it can depress the uptake

925
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,800
of of the other two particularly you

926
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,679
know calcium magnesium can interact a

927
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,560
little bit pottassium even though it's

928
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,838
low here that's not a that's actually a

929
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:44,559
pretty high value for potassium but

930
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:46,719
calcium relative to magnesium is low uh

931
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,519
that ratio of calcium magnesium is

932
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,759
around so higher than 10 typical soils

933
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,960
it would be around five five times as

934
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,160
much calcium as magnesium so in this

935
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,159
case here we actually might need to

936
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,118
recommend a little bit of magnesium to

937
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,239
bring that balance back up so it

938
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,480
wouldn't be unusual for a test like that

939
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,959
to have a little bit of magnesium

940
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,599
sulfate in the recommendation not so

941
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,199
much to change the pH this doesn't

942
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
really change the pH but it just adds a

943
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,639
little bit of magnesium in the soil to

944
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,640
bring that ratio into

945
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:27,239
balance okay example four

946
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,800
blueberries Sandy LOM soil we can see

947
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,039
that we're low in

948
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,318
phosphorus high in potassium low in

949
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:38,639
calcium magnesium is

950
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:40,440
medium pH is 5.9 and organic matter is

951
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,159
you know pretty low

952
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,440
here so what would you recommend in this

953
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:48,358
case or what do you think a soil test

954
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,358
recommendation should

955
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,318
say one of the things we would want to

956
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,838
do is try to raise that organic matter a

957
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:57,838
little bit blueberries like organic

958
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:02,119
matter 1. .3 is really quite low so we

959
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,960
want to do that um but the pH is 5.9 we

960
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,079
have to lower that quite a bit and one

961
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,358
of the things we know that About

962
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,519
Blueberries is that they don't really

963
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,239
require a whole lot of of some of these

964
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,039
catons they're really good at sucking

965
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,919
that out of the soil

966
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,480
so all we might need to recommend here

967
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,318
is just to lower the ph increase your

968
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,519
organic matter and those other nutrients

969
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,239
will probably take care of themselves

970
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:29,880
because we're measuring that a high pH

971
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:31,159
when we lower the ph the blueberries

972
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,079
blueberries become much more efficient

973
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,679
at taking these nutrients

974
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
up so I see a question here about how

975
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:40,879
strong is the effect of added nitrogen

976
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,280
on ph it depends a little bit on your

977
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,519
nitrogen Source if you use ammonium

978
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
sulfate as a nitrogen source which we

979
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:52,679
often recommend on blueberries it

980
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,079
acidifies the soil if we use Ura it also

981
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:59,279
acidifies the soil a little bit because

982
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,560
it's adding um nh4 plus to the soil but

983
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,280
if we add nitrate to the soil like

984
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,318
calcium nitrate it tends to either be

985
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,680
neutral or or raise the ph a little bit

986
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,599
so it depends a little bit on the source

987
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,879
of nitrogen's the impact on ph but

988
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:16,079
ammonium sulfate is going to have the

989
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,640
strongest negative effect on ph Ura

990
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,240
somewhere in the middle your nitrate

991
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:24,039
forms the nitrogen not much but we

992
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,358
wouldn't use nitrogen to actually try to

993
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:27,880
affect the pH we would use it to maybe

994
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:30,358
keep it at a certain level we wouldn't

995
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,720
use say ammonium sulfate to lower the

996
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,598
ph1 unit that would be way too much and

997
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,000
the question is can blueberries use

998
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,119
nitrate they can use nitrate but they

999
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,800
don't like it they're much more uh

1000
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,000
preferentially use the ammonium form of

1001
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
nitrogen and take that up if you put

1002
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,519
blueberry roots in a solution that just

1003
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,680
has nitrate available to it the roots

1004
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,599
will turn black and a plal die if you

1005
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,279
put

1006
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,280
blueberries in the field and you apply

1007
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,720
hydrate fertilizers to it the bacteria

1008
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,839
in the soil under low PH conditions

1009
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:05,959
which you should have if you're planting

1010
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:08,239
blueberries anyway will convert that

1011
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,358
nitrate into ammonium and where it can

1012
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,838
be taken up more readily and used by the

1013
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:16,078
blueberry plant so you get away with it

1014
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:18,519
but uh nitrate is more leech and all so

1015
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,280
ammonium is a better Source because it

1016
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,960
not only lowers the pH but it's more of

1017
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,599
a slow release more available over a

1018
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,400
longer period of time and blueberries

1019
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,240
can take it up directly so that's a

1020
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,240
preferable source for

1021
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,599
blueberries he just a couple more

1022
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:39,199
examples here uh blueberries clay LOM

1023
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,318
soil

1024
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,919
were high you know medium and phosphorus

1025
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,960
high potassium high calcium high

1026
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:51,519
magnesium good Boron pH is pretty high

1027
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,159
organic matter is pretty high

1028
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:59,119
U what we recommend

1029
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:01,199
here when to grow blueberries well if we

1030
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,160
go back to that chart we looked at

1031
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:07,078
before and we saw a ph up around six and

1032
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,440
we see here that the Caton exchange

1033
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,400
capacity is probably going to be pretty

1034
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,358
high because the organic matter is going

1035
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,838
to be pretty high we're already high in

1036
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,358
calcium magnesium and we don't want a

1037
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,279
lot of calcium magnesium in the soil

1038
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,159
blueberries don't like calcium in

1039
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,000
particular the best recommendation here

1040
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,679
is probably just don't grow blueberries

1041
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,920
the soil is just not appropriate for

1042
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,318
blueberries

1043
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,400
the Caton exchange capacity coupled with

1044
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:34,400
the pH is so great that it would take so

1045
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,800
much sulfur to lower that that it

1046
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,318
probably won't be worth it economically

1047
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,039
and that high calcium is going to cause

1048
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:44,039
problems U for years on end because of

1049
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,000
that couple more uh strawberries in a

1050
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,039
sandy

1051
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,079
soil low phosphorus low

1052
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,079
calcium low ph

1053
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,599
low

1054
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:06,118
Boron low organic matter so this soil

1055
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,920
test is probably going to come back with

1056
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,760
several recommendations calcitic lme

1057
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,200
because we were low on calcium some

1058
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,200
phosphorus some Boron and some organic

1059
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,358
matter and uh final example here

1060
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:28,000
raspberries and alomi soil or

1061
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:28,000
medium most things

1062
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:36,239
fairly high in aluminum good Boron high

1063
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:38,318
pH organic matter now most of the time

1064
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,799
if you saw a soil test like this you

1065
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,000
might say well you know I've got medium

1066
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,640
values for most of these things um

1067
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,599
organic matter is pretty good pH is in

1068
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:50,400
the range I might want it probably don't

1069
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,599
have to do too much here but in this

1070
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,039
case here uh we might want to correct

1071
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,160
that with a small amount of pnk but we

1072
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,880
might want to add a little bit bit

1073
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,519
higher rate of lime than was recommended

1074
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,760
in the soil test and the reason for that

1075
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:06,679
is this aluminum value is pretty high

1076
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,520
and that can cause problems uh later on

1077
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:11,558
and the higher we raise the ph the less

1078
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:15,519
available aluminum is so we might want

1079
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,960
to push the pH to the very high end so

1080
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,039
that it makes the aluminum less

1081
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,760
available to the plant and aluminum can

1082
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,279
be toxic that's why we don't really want

1083
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,920
it it can be toxic so in this case here

1084
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,519
the aluminum value is providing diagnos

1085
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,639
IC information to a plant uh to

1086
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,280
understand maybe why those plants aren't

1087
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,039
growing very well or why what we might

1088
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,240
want to do to make a correction before

1089
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:36,239
we

1090
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,519
plant this is a a field of blueberries

1091
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,919
this is a real situation and the

1092
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:49,838
blueberry plants in this section

1093
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,358
here uh weren't growing so

1094
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,920
well and the other thing is the grass in

1095
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,920
this section wasn't growing so well

1096
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,440
either and yet down here at this end the

1097
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,440
grass is growing pretty well now we took

1098
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,240
soil tests from three different places

1099
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,039
from plantings that were three different

1100
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:10,479
ages uh in one place the plants look

1101
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,199
pretty good the side was fine pH was

1102
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,559
good

1103
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:18,679
um aluminum phosphorus is okay uh the

1104
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,319
other place the plants look really

1105
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,558
pathetic the pH was a little bit higher

1106
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:26,279
than average aluminum was pretty high

1107
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,680
plants were pretty sick and there was

1108
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,599
dead sod and here this is the

1109
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,199
interesting thing the pH is really high

1110
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,359
you think blueberries might not do so

1111
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:38,199
well there and they were kind of fair

1112
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,519
they weren't terrible and the sod was

1113
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:42,558
living these plants with a higher pH

1114
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:45,159
were a lot better off than the plants

1115
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:48,599
that were sick at even a lower pH what

1116
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:51,078
was going on here well it appears from

1117
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,400
the soil test that in this case here

1118
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,839
aluminum was really high and it could be

1119
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,119
coming toxic to the blueberry plants and

1120
00:46:56,838 --> 00:47:02,159
as we raise the ph even though the

1121
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,400
aluminum was up a little bit the higher

1122
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,519
pH makes that aluminum unavailable to

1123
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,838
the plant so the plants were able to

1124
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:13,318
survive a little bit longer and do

1125
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:14,719
better so um pH can react and relate to

1126
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:17,400
a lot of different

1127
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:19,358
things and looking at these values of

1128
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,680
some of these microns can give you Clues

1129
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,199
sometimes as to how things were working

1130
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:23,199
out there in the

1131
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,199
soil last last thing the last concept I

1132
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:32,000
want to mention is that this nutrient

1133
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,919
uptake occurs through uh three different

1134
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,599
ways when we have nutrients in The Soil

1135
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,800
Direct contact with roots so the root

1136
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,680
surface actually like almost has direct

1137
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,599
contact with the soil and the nutrient

1138
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:49,519
just kind of jumps right across that

1139
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:51,640
membrane mass flow which is a nutrients

1140
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,358
dissolved in water that get taken into

1141
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:57,039
the plant through the transpirational

1142
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:59,598
stream or diffusion and diffusion is

1143
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,199
sort of short distance transport of

1144
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,160
these nutrients when they dissolve in

1145
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,399
water the water actually doesn't move

1146
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:09,159
through the plant like mass flow but the

1147
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,559
nutrients diffuse through an aquous

1148
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,799
solution from a level of high

1149
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,559
concentration in the soil to a lower

1150
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,839
concentration inside the root so there's

1151
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,800
three different mechanisms and nutrients

1152
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,119
that are primarily taken up by contacted

1153
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,400
diffusion must be in close proximity to

1154
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:28,200
the root itself the

1155
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,760
root on average only has about 1% and at

1156
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:33,439
most 3% of it of the surface of that

1157
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,040
root is in direct contact with the soil

1158
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,920
so nutrients have to be thoroughly mixed

1159
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,920
in order to be taken up prior to

1160
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:48,239
planting this is a this is with corn but

1161
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,359
it it's appropriate for all of our crops

1162
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,439
this is a mode of uptake for the various

1163
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:55,598
nutrients based on this root

1164
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,280
interception mass flow and diffusion and

1165
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,599
different nutrients have different mods

1166
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,599
basically being taken up into the plant

1167
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,200
nitrogen is mostly taken up by mass flow

1168
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:10,119
in other words nitrogen nitrate nitrogen

1169
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:11,639
and ammonium nitrogen get dissolved in

1170
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,480
the acous solution when a plant

1171
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,879
transpires it moves into the root system

1172
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,358
and uh and the water leaves the leaf

1173
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,960
leaving the nutrient inside the plant

1174
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,880
that's why you can put nitrogen on the

1175
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,559
soil surface and it gets down into the

1176
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,960
roots because it dissolves in the water

1177
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:31,839
it's soluble it's taken up by mass flow

1178
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:35,838
someone also asked earlier about um

1179
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,558
Boron Boron also is very highly soluble

1180
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,960
and taken up by mass flow that's why we

1181
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,559
can apply Boron to the soil surface it

1182
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,079
gets dissolved gets taken up by mass

1183
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,960
flow no problem we can apply it after

1184
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,839
the plants are

1185
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,838
established but some of these other

1186
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:55,639
nutrients uh are mostly taken up by

1187
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:57,759
things like diffusion like phosphorus um

1188
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,920
so it has to be thoroughly incorporated

1189
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,359
into the soil it doesn't dissolve very

1190
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,400
quickly it doesn't move through the soil

1191
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:06,558
very rapidly so we want to have that

1192
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,318
mixed in with the soil before we plant

1193
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,880
same way with potassium a lot of

1194
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:17,960
diffusion not that much mass

1195
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:20,400
flow so that's why magnesium calcium um

1196
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,119
not much diffusion some mass flow some

1197
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,519
rote interception but certainly for p

1198
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,280
and K we want to make sure we have that

1199
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:27,480
mixed in with the soil very well

1200
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,160
otherwise the roofs won't be able to

1201
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,679
take it

1202
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:34,558
up these tables of course are going to

1203
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,598
be uh available to you to download to

1204
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,119
print off and uh it should be right here

1205
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,359
in this website in a few days when it

1206
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,358
gets

1207
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:47,039
posted now once our plants are

1208
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,159
established and they're growing we don't

1209
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,400
really rely on a soil test so much we

1210
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:54,719
rely on a soil test to tell us what our

1211
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,440
pH is but we don't pay much attention to

1212
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,279
the levels of p and K and magnesium and

1213
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,480
calcium after that once the plants are

1214
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,359
underground we look use a foler analysis

1215
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,480
to make adjustments and we use the pH in

1216
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,078
conjunction with a foler analysis and

1217
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,559
that's going to be the subject of an

1218
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:13,400
upcoming

1219
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,359
webinar next week Eric Hansen is going

1220
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,639
to talk about these nutrient sources and

1221
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:19,719
some of the characteristics of these

1222
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,558
various nutrient sources that are out

1223
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:25,000
there that you can use in a pre-plant

1224
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,720
situation to both modify the ph and add

1225
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,280
phosph there potassium magnesium and so

1226
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,000
forth and look at it from both a

1227
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,559
conventional perspective and a

1228
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,559
perspective of of an organic

1229
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,480
grower so that's uh what I have for the

1230
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,199
presentation and uh there's a few

1231
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,119
minutes left if anybody wants to type in

1232
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:46,000
some questions we'll see if I can try to

1233
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:49,318
answer

1234
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,318
them thanks

1235
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:57,358
Marvin

1236
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,399
I just want to remind everyone that if

1237
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:04,280
you haven't filled out the demographics

1238
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,798
questionnaire or the preest that they're

1239
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:11,119
available down below and you can email

1240
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:13,679
them to me at mcm4 cornell.edu if you

1241
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,760
missed either of the first two webinars

1242
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:20,078
there's a link to them in the archive on

1243
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:23,920
the bottom left hand side of your

1244
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,839
screen and as Marvin indicated Dr Eric

1245
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,639
Hansen from Michigan State Unity will be

1246
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,639
our speaker next

1247
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,598
week Jeff asks about organic sources of

1248
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:41,119
nutrients and her characteristics that's

1249
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,798
what the entire webinar is going to be

1250
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,640
about next week so we'll save that for

1251
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:47,639
Eric to talk

1252
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:57,639
about an acceptable Boron level

1253
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,920
generally you want um at least one pound

1254
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:01,159
preferably 2 pounds that's sort of that

1255
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,639
ballpark that we're looking at and

1256
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,519
fortunately for Boron it's not so

1257
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,480
dependent on soil test and it's also uh

1258
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,119
most soil testing Labs use a separate

1259
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,119
extractant for the Boron they use a hot

1260
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,240
water extractant so they just put hot

1261
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,880
water in the soil take it out run it for

1262
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:18,919
Boron so the procedure for looking at

1263
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:22,480
Boron is fairly standardized across Labs

1264
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,880
so um we can pretty confidently say

1265
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,920
between 1 and 2 pounds is where you want

1266
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,358
to aim for this less pound you probably

1267
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,240
have to supplement uh and that's going

1268
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:32,159
to be a lot more standard among Labs

1269
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,639
than most of the other nutrient levels

1270
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,639
you're going to

1271
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:46,480
get uh Jeff asks is there a

1272
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,480
physiological reason for blueberries

1273
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,639
aversion to calcium and nitrate that's a

1274
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:56,519
really good question so blueberries have

1275
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:58,759
evolved in these low PH soils and

1276
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:02,119
nutrient levels are very low in these

1277
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,400
low PH soils Sandy soils wet soils and

1278
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:05,960
they've evolve some characteristics that

1279
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,798
enable them to survive under those

1280
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,559
conditions and one of those um

1281
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:12,079
adaptations is this association with

1282
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,760
endom micro risal

1283
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,480
fungi that uh colonize the roots of

1284
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,880
blueberries and then actually help the

1285
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,440
blueberry increase the surface area as

1286
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,318
they go out and grow through the soil

1287
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,280
and the blueberry gives that endom micro

1288
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:32,000
risal fungus some carbohydrate and in

1289
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,400
return the fungus pulls in nitrogen and

1290
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,559
phosphorus and gives it to the blueberry

1291
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,480
plant most of the time the nitrogen

1292
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,480
that's in the soil is in the ammonium

1293
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,159
form of nitrogen and so some people

1294
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,079
think because of this endom micro risal

1295
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:47,960
Association the fungi prefer it and the

1296
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,880
blueberries ended up just evolving a

1297
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,159
preference for that because that is the

1298
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,079
most available type of nitrogen in low

1299
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,239
PH

1300
00:54:53,079 --> 00:55:00,760
soils um and actually when a a regular

1301
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:03,118
plant a non- blueberry plant takes up

1302
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,640
nitrate interestingly enough inside the

1303
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,599
plant it converts it into the ammonium

1304
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,960
form and moves it around and then

1305
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,680
reconverts it into nitrate forms at

1306
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,599
times because if you look at amino acids

1307
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,879
and all that uh

1308
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,640
comprise proteins they're in the

1309
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,640
ammonium form so why I guess maybe a

1310
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,519
better question is why other plants

1311
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,118
haven't evolved at an adaptation to take

1312
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,280
up ammonium nitrogen since energetically

1313
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,838
it's easier to do that than it is to

1314
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,240
take up nitrate and then reduce it back

1315
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,318
down to ammonium and move it around and

1316
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:37,279
in terms of calcium I'm not exactly sure

1317
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:40,480
why that is I think it has to do with

1318
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,960
inside the plant interactions with iron

1319
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,440
and uh somehow it it maybe precipitates

1320
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,039
with the iron inhibits it but high

1321
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,000
calcium soils and blueberries just don't

1322
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:55,480
go well together even if the pH is

1323
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,480
low one of the things will recommend in

1324
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,199
a soil test if the calcium level is

1325
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,318
above a certain amount uh even if the pH

1326
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,279
is kind of close and you can lower it

1327
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,838
with sulur we might recommend look

1328
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,960
someplace else this isn't a good soil

1329
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,679
for blueberries you just know

1330
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,720
historically high calcium and

1331
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:12,719
blueberries don't go well

1332
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,480
together uh does soil moisture content

1333
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,920
at the time of sampling affect soil test

1334
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,880
results not really uh not if you're just

1335
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,000
looking at the nutrients because what

1336
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,798
they'll do when they get the soil uh

1337
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,559
back in is they'll often dry it down

1338
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,639
anyway and uh so whether you send them

1339
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,960
dry soil or it comes to the lab and they

1340
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,960
dry it before they analyze it doesn't

1341
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,119
make a huge difference there is there's

1342
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,318
some debate uh whether uh there needs to

1343
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,798
be moisture correction to soils when

1344
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:46,239
they do the analysis but that has more

1345
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,519
to do with some Labs scoop soil and some

1346
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:51,199
Labs weigh it and the question is do you

1347
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:53,798
get a different result when you scoop it

1348
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:57,879
or you weigh it or you have it moist or

1349
00:56:53,798 --> 00:57:00,480
it's dried um so it can make a slight

1350
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,079
difference not so much qualitatively but

1351
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,318
quantitatively but Labs have not come to

1352
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:08,400
consensus over whether it needs to be

1353
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:12,038
dried or not most Labs do it

1354
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,639
dry I think most Labs do it dry how I

1355
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:16,480
feel about ammonium phosphates for

1356
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,598
blueberry ammonium phosphates are if

1357
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,318
you're low in phosphorus and you need a

1358
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,440
fertilize the plant that would be a good

1359
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,038
way of killing two birds with one stone

1360
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,200
it provides an ammonium source of

1361
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:28,640
nitrogen and it provides that phosphorus

1362
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:28,639
at the same

1363
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,200
time and do blueberries have a higher

1364
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,719
iron content

1365
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,679
I I don't believe they have a higher

1366
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:45,199
iron content than other plants that's

1367
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:47,719
not the case but for some reason uh iron

1368
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,838
availability seems to impact blueberries

1369
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:52,078
more than iron availability in other

1370
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,358
crops again I'm not exactly sure why

1371
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,119
that is maybe somebody out there knows

1372
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,119
the answer to

1373
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,079
that thank you very much Marvin I really

1374
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,838
appreciate you speaking to us today

1375
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,599
again next week our topic is soil and

1376
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,798
nutrient

1377
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,880
management um and we'll be looking at

1378
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:16,159
correction of soil problems application

1379
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:19,240
technology conventional nutrient sources

1380
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:22,358
organic nutrient sources Lyman and pH

1381
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:23,719
reduction with Eric Hansen from MSU a

1382
00:58:22,358 --> 00:58:26,719
couple more questions

1383
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:26,719
Marvin

1384
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:35,519
so um the availability of calcium

1385
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,358
sulfate in New York it's gypsum I know

1386
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,798
that there are um I'm not specifically

1387
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:43,719
New York but a drywall for housing is

1388
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:47,000
gypson and there are some places that I

1389
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:48,679
know are crushing that to extract the uh

1390
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,440
material from within the drywall and

1391
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,399
then selling that for agricultural uses

1392
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,838
and that's great source of

1393
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,079
gypson and the high iron content is

1394
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,159
related to the low PH like with

1395
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,640
cranberry yeah it is if you look at

1396
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,558
those charts where we looked at the

1397
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:06,279
availability of nutrients with ph you

1398
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:09,839
can see that at the lower end uh iron

1399
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,400
availability goes way up for some reason

1400
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,838
you know calcium inside the plant not

1401
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,599
outside the plant the soil but inside

1402
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:18,318
the plant has some impact on that

1403
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:19,920
availability of calcium it could have to

1404
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,558
do it's a little bit it could have to do

1405
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,200
with the fact that active iron in the

1406
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,798
plant is in a feric form and maybe with

1407
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,798
too much calcium in the plant it

1408
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,599
converts more to the I'm sorry it's in

1409
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,880
the ferris form it converts more to the

1410
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:37,599
feric form so it goes from fe+ 2 which

1411
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:41,079
is active biologically active to fe+ 3

1412
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,838
which is inactive and calcium may cause

1413
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:45,079
the iron to go from one form to the

1414
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:46,358
other in which case a leaf analysis will

1415
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,680
still show you have iron in a plant

1416
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:50,279
because it doesn't distinguish between

1417
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,239
the two types it's just that the type in

1418
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,760
high calcium soils is more in a feric

1419
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:58,598
inactive form so that's uh that's that's

1420
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,599
my hypothesis again maybe somebody else

1421
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:07,519
knows all right if there aren't any

1422
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:07,519
other

1423
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:16,440
questions then I think we'll close thank

1424
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,440
you so much Marvin for your insights

1425
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:27,199
welcome thank you everyone and we hope

1426
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,200
you'll join us all again next

1427
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,519
week
