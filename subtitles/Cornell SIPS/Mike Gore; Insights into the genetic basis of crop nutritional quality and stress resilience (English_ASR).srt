1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:11,309
the gate now so the three research areas

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,289
that my lab encompasses here is focused

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,029
on crop nutrition of quality high

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,410
throughput phenotyping quantitative

7
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:21,390
genetics and genomics a large part of my

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,240
research is focused on maize which we

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,969
all love but it is a global starchy

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,669
staple crop and that would greatly

11
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:32,368
benefit from biofortification for a

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,800
development of nutrient dense grain why

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,869
I say this is when you focus on this map

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,449
here and this is an applet maize

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,459
consumption by mean percentage of daily

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,620
calories per capita you can see

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,230
countries in sub-saharan Africa that are

18
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,089
having to subsist very highly in terms

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,148
of their caloric intake from maize and

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,370
this orange country right here is Zambia

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,679
and in looking at the nutritional

22
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,419
profile of maize it often does not

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,198
provide adequate daily levels of

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,030
essential nutrients that we need to

25
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,060
survive as human beings and also feeding

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,239
to animals and the ones that we work on

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,100
in my research group is iron and zinc

28
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:15,780
and then Pro vitamin a vitamin E and the

29
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:19,228
vitamin complex but as you see here

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,560
maize is great in terms of vehicle for

31
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:25,650
getting carbohydrates out to animals and

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,990
human beings but is very deep opera in

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,280
terms of nutritional quality and so as

34
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,379
an approach you can have a plant bio

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,810
fortifying itself so harnessing the

36
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,399
genes and alleles that naturally occur

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,799
in the population or through

38
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,219
transgenesis or you could also

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,368
complement through a plant breeding with

40
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:48,840
chemical fortification dietary

41
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:52,049
diversification or are in the sense

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,109
giving vitamins to people but one of the

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,270
arguments that I would like to make is

44
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:59,368
biofortification is targeted to rural

45
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,548
small holder farmers it's sustainable

46
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:05,569
and it's renewable but these three other

47
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,860
approaches should be complementary to

48
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,868
biofortification because there is no

49
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,759
single panacea that can be used to

50
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:15,169
overcome nutritional deficiencies and

51
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:18,409
our growing world population

52
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:20,030
one of the major traits or phenotypes

53
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,460
will be focused on in my lab is

54
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,900
pro-vitamin a and if you look at the

55
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,330
global prevalence of vitamin A

56
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,980
deficiency in the world and see the map

57
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,610
here of sub-saharan Africa and that

58
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:35,299
overlays quite well with in terms of

59
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:38,240
caloric intake of maize daily calories

60
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,400
and also in these sub-saharan Africa

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,370
countries people are subsisting on a lot

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,670
of other crops such as cassava which are

63
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,629
in a sense low in vitamin content as

64
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:53,179
well and the impact of this there are 7

65
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,829
million pregnant women 127 million

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,409
preschool age children that are vitamin

67
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,330
A deficient in the world and the

68
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,959
consequence also vitamin A deficiency

69
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,730
causes 600,000 early childhood deaths

70
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,580
blindness and 500,000 children each year

71
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:11,919
and all of this is preventable through

72
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,780
improved nutritional food consumption

73
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,729
and so when breeding any crop the first

74
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,150
question you must ask yourself is there

75
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:22,699
natural variation for this particular

76
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,170
phenotype and in maize there is so if we

77
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,810
were just looking at the gradient of

78
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:31,729
yellow or light yellow to dark orange

79
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,019
kernel color phenotypes in a world's

80
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,959
collection of temperate and tropical

81
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,030
maize throughout the world if you look

82
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,819
at the total carotenoid profile in the

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,799
maize grain beta carotene which has the

84
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,319
highest Pro vitamin A activity only

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,510
accounts for 6% of all those carotenoids

86
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,889
so now once you highlight that when

87
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,169
we're talking about carotenoids and

88
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:55,039
maize are mostly found in the endosperm

89
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:58,939
and when you break out that 6% slice

90
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,979
here on average 1.7 microgram per gram

91
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:04,099
are found in these maize lines so that

92
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:06,289
is not very much and harvest Plus which

93
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,769
is very much focused on biofortification

94
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:11,500
of our important food crops as worked

95
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,079
with human nutritionists and they're

96
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,379
highly recommend and tenfold increase as

97
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,900
a pair - like the average there in terms

98
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:23,930
of this as a set breeding target and

99
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,699
this is a breeding target that people

100
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,990
have been trying to reach and some

101
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,759
breeding programs have actually

102
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,960
surpassed at this point in time

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:39,039
we also work on vitamin E in my lab as

104
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,930
well and in this case I would kind of

105
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,240
define vitamin e's more as an

106
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,189
insufficiency and when you look at

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,660
reports of insufficiency in the world

108
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:51,160
that would be in countries such as

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,860
Brazil the u.s. Tunisia South Africa but

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,590
in the u.s. about 26 or 41 percent of

111
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,259
individuals have plasma alpha-tocopherol

112
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,029
content in their plasma that is at a

113
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,329
level that increases their risk for

114
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:07,179
cardiovascular disease and so although

115
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:10,589
few reports exist for other developing

116
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,850
nations it is thought of that these

117
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:16,949
concentrations are probably even lower

118
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:19,720
and more widespread and thinking about

119
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,389
vitamin E and moreso alpha-tocopherol

120
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,110
which has highest vitamin E activity in

121
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,300
the human body and also animals we see

122
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,790
here of all the tobik Romanovs found in

123
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,949
maize grain here we have alpha

124
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,980
tocopherol in this shaded blue color

125
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:40,029
right here and that accounts for about

126
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,280
11% and almost all of that alpha

127
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:45,939
tocopherol is found in the embryo of

128
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:48,989
maize grain and here we have a higher

129
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:53,319
average as it compared to beta carotene

130
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,449
8.19 and if we do the calculations and

131
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,699
working with human nutritionists this is

132
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,099
approximately close to an a five-fold

133
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,589
increase that we would have to have as a

134
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,550
breeding target on average and so when

135
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:12,039
we look at where we were when we began

136
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:16,090
this one project about in 2010 the the

137
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,170
first take-home here is a lot of these

138
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:22,389
compounds are all derived from a shared

139
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:25,660
biosynthetic pathways such as like a

140
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,719
traumatic amino acid pathway and a p gdp

141
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,580
passed away here so here we have h GA

142
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
which is coming off and being used as a

143
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,930
head group and the final DP which is

144
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,990
important for the tail group and these

145
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,470
through the chemical action of the

146
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,879
enzymes themself give rise to all the

147
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,820
chemical variation for

148
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:49,089
criminals in maize grain and these two

149
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:53,529
jeans right here BT e1 and BTE four had

150
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:58,539
been we in our lab had been found to be

151
00:06:53,529 --> 00:07:02,199
underlying large effect qtls and for the

152
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,569
carotenoid traits here we see the two

153
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,629
genes like e and critter b1 which have

154
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:10,089
been published on previously in 2008 and

155
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:13,600
2010 out of the work here at Cornell and

156
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:15,399
Ed's lab and these two genes himself

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,850
have been used in the sim and harvest

158
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,370
plus breeding program to develop orange

159
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,060
high pro-vitamin a maze so that seems to

160
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,970
work very well but these particular

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,689
genes them themselves are only capturing

162
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:36,430
just a snapshot of the variation in in

163
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:40,980
the maize germ plasm pool so what we're

164
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,870
trying to now do here is use large

165
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,390
populations to try to map the locations

166
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,120
of other qtls genes and in the maze

167
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,279
genome and here we have hapmap version 1

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,209
and version 2 that have been genotype

169
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,909
and impudent projected in the maze name

170
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:00,849
population here and working with our

171
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,840
colleagues at msu and dr. Dean della

172
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,800
pennis lab

173
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:09,759
we've run HPLC and almost 20,000 HPLC

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,040
runs to quantify the carotenoid content

175
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,839
and composition and the same for took a

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,840
criminal vitamin e took a chrome and all

177
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,939
content and composition and expression

178
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:23,409
profiling has also been performed as

179
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:27,790
well on all of the like 26 NAMM parents

180
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:31,450
and also at 6th of stages post

181
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,729
pollination times 40,000 genes so in a

182
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:37,299
sense we want to really understand which

183
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:40,780
genes are turned off over the the mental

184
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:44,549
program of the kernel itself and to also

185
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:49,169
put the QTL on a time axis

186
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:51,629
and to carry out this this research in

187
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:54,479
animation and population what we first

188
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,639
do is what is referred to as a joint

189
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,590
linkage analysis and here we're

190
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,750
identifying the qtls

191
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,300
in the maze genome so you can think of

192
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,399
the maze name population as a map within

193
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,379
a map and here we're just using the

194
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,389
recent recombination that has happened

195
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,840
in the construction of the maze dam

196
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:14,580
population so in a sense we're just

197
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,840
identifying the chromosomal segments in

198
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:25,040
the genome that have that QTL and with

199
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,040
the jiwa switch now we're using a higher

200
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:31,379
quantity of snips here what renowned you

201
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,539
is using is the ancient recombination

202
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,549
and so this is the through the

203
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,069
evolutionary history of maze and you can

204
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:40,979
see the LD blocks compared to the recent

205
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,440
recombination map are much smaller so

206
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,409
this is where we're going to receive the

207
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,260
higher resolution for trying to finally

208
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:50,730
map and hopefully I identified the

209
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,649
causal genes that are controlling

210
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,759
variation for these important

211
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:58,799
nutritional grain trades and so in our

212
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,169
work what we've found here if you just

213
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,359
focus on the carotenoid traits first we

214
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:06,029
found that essentially 10 a priori

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,190
pathway and two novel genes mostly

216
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:12,110
underlie the natural variation for these

217
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:14,970
carotenoid traits in maize grain and

218
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,680
just to walk you through this dxs two

219
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,100
and three so these two genes were

220
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,899
involved in the parental tail synthesis

221
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,840
three genes upstream of the pathway

222
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,500
branch point right here psy one PDS one

223
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,170
in mutants right here and then these

224
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,409
four genes within the core pathway right

225
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:37,679
here like e blue one crit RB 1 and zip 1

226
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:39,329
and we reconfirmed like II and crit RB 1

227
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,029
which had been previously used in the

228
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,090
Senate harvest plus breeding program and

229
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,909
we also identified a carotenoid cleavage

230
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:51,240
enzyme which essentially is turning over

231
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:53,819
the in the carotenoid compounds and

232
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,570
chewing them up which is definitely not

233
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,570
what you want

234
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:03,319
and so when we dissect this even further

235
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,040
essentially about six a priority pathway

236
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,360
genes that are what we refer to as

237
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,639
expression QTL or explaining the

238
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,909
majority of the phenotypic variation for

239
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:18,169
for these traits and this is like e psy

240
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:23,870
one Zepp one CCD one DX s two in critter

241
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:26,419
b1 and in a sense these variants that

242
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:30,379
are associating with the phenotype are

243
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:33,349
our cysts and it's explaining the the

244
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,990
fact that there are expression QTL and

245
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,320
then the other genes that were hid do

246
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:42,470
not appear to be expression QTL so

247
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,120
perhaps that the the actual snips or the

248
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,730
cause of variants are changing the

249
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,429
activity of the enzyme itself that would

250
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,778
be like loot one DHS three a mutants and

251
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:55,909
PDS one and then the two novel genes

252
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:57,649
that we hit here one is an

253
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:59,659
uncharacterrized protein so you can

254
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,740
obviously just hypothesize what you

255
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,299
think it may be because it's

256
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,278
uncharacterized that's a great thing

257
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:07,179
about candidate genes in this context

258
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,439
and then the other one was a mid

259
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,809
transcription factor i would like to

260
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,730
point out that these two novel genes

261
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,958
here though were only associated with

262
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,959
total carotenoids

263
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:23,269
so with this maze named population of

264
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,810
5,000 recombinant inbred lines we were

265
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:29,629
able to really dissect down to the gene

266
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:32,359
level the largest effect QTL and when

267
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:34,759
you focus on this orange part so this is

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,430
the amount of like phenotypic variants

269
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,740
explained by a priority genes the grey

270
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:42,199
part is the amount explained by those

271
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,230
two genes that are novel and these are

272
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,730
on unresolved low sigh in a sense we

273
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,940
don't really know what those causal

274
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,800
genes are so by by seeing this you could

275
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,899
probably be saying well why do you have

276
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,458
to use the maze name population you

277
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:59,059
could have just done my candidate gene

278
00:12:55,458 --> 00:13:01,578
approach what we didn't realize at the

279
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:03,919
time is that be known a priori kanda

280
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:07,219
genes would explain the majority of the

281
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,519
variation but for the genes that are

282
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,889
unresolved they explain about one person

283
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,870
cent or less of the variation and in

284
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:17,929
those regions of the maze genome there

285
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,639
aren't any a priority candidate genes so

286
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,969
those are things that we can certainly

287
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,460
follow up on but in a breeding context

288
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,580
they don't explain that much of the

289
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,580
variation and so now when you think

290
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,129
about breeding for beta carotene which

291
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,560
is the compound that has the highest

292
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:39,769
robot M&amp;A activity found in the maize

293
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:43,279
grain these five genes here are the ones

294
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:46,819
that you would focus on the XS - psy one

295
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,250
like II and crit RB one and so you can

296
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,500
think of very much as this is just

297
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,029
reduced to a combinatorial breeding

298
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,279
approach and you're just running to

299
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,439
figure out the best allelic combination

300
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,679
to put together in your breeding program

301
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,830
so that you can calibrate the

302
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:07,959
composition and the total or the type of

303
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:10,700
carotenoid phenotype in your grain and

304
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,200
just these two two genes that we have

305
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,150
just talked about previously they've

306
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,950
been used and the harvest loss breeding

307
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:20,329
program they have been used to

308
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:23,480
re-release new hybrids in in Zambia and

309
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,180
this is an outgrowth of the orange hyper

310
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,700
about him in a maze and some some work

311
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:32,839
that was published about five years ago

312
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:36,470
showed that this orange hi-pro vitamin A

313
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:39,410
maize was as effective as providing

314
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:43,730
vitamins to Zambian children that had

315
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:47,389
low levels of vitamin A so it isn't just

316
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,180
that we were able to select on the genes

317
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:53,179
himself but what was shown by

318
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:55,099
nutritionist is that this product this

319
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:57,679
orange high pro vitamin a is as

320
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,470
effective as giving vitamins to the

321
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,649
children so I think this is one of the

322
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,040
rare cases where you work closely with

323
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,990
like the the growers and the avarice

324
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,399
population and you understand their

325
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,830
their needs and that's something that

326
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
harvest Plus does very well so that

327
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,210
after maybe eight to ten years of

328
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,149
developing a new hybrid or a new emperor

329
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:24,129
line people will actually use it

330
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:27,159
and some of the work now that we're

331
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:30,698
focused on is really on deployment of

332
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,620
these genes and then understanding how

333
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:34,929
well these hybrids are performing under

334
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,198
heat and drought stress and Christiana

335
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:42,609
for my PhD and my my lab worked for a

336
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:44,588
year in Zimbabwe with CIMMYT and here is

337
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,339
one of the field days that they had

338
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,500
where they were showing to to the public

339
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,410
these new very least orange hyper

340
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,250
vitamin A and breadlines hybrids and

341
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:58,929
then showing you know people how they

342
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,659
look after being cooked and then they

343
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,929
could like taste them as well here's an

344
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:08,319
image from her her drought test that she

345
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:10,509
was doing and we're about 300 hybrids

346
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,339
that were bred to be high in pro by men

347
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:15,100
a were tested under heat and drought

348
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,440
stress and we we have all this seed now

349
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,829
in our cold chamber will be analyzing it

350
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,290
as well to see how the composition of

351
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:26,169
that grain was perturbed over time from

352
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:29,828
from the heat and drought stress so

353
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:32,349
moving on now to vitamin E this is a

354
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:35,588
nice contrast here because here we found

355
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,720
that a priori eight that is a priori

356
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,029
pathway genes and then six novels genes

357
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,040
explained about sixty percent of that

358
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:44,470
natural variation for it took a criminal

359
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:48,250
traits in maize grain and here we have

360
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,519
dia XS 2 DX s 3 and if you recall those

361
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:57,068
were hit four carotenoids as well so the

362
00:16:51,519 --> 00:17:02,230
re d H 2h p BD 1 SDS bt e 3h g d 1b d 3

363
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:04,418
B&amp;B t e4 so the majority of the

364
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,419
phenotypic variation though is explained

365
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,689
by a priori genes for tocotrienols and

366
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:12,549
so for trying all traits have high

367
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:17,230
antioxidant capacity and that would be

368
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:20,168
such as the the gene hdgt 1 but we found

369
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,539
that novel genes mostly controlling the

370
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:25,059
variation for tick off roles so if you

371
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:26,740
look down in this part of the table here

372
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:28,449
so this would be like these snare

373
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,048
proteins the fibrillin this

374
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,940
transporation protein and PhD gene here

375
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:38,150
and working with dean Dilip in Isla

376
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,190
in a rabid OPS's there I say we've been

377
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,350
able to confirm that some of these genes

378
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,320
do have a contribution to this pathway

379
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:49,189
so that's really nice because we've been

380
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:52,939
able to take the gene from maze put it

381
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,640
in a line of rabid ops instead no longer

382
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,190
has this gene functional to show the

383
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,560
confirmation and recapitulation of the

384
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,200
phenotype the two genes that I would

385
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,250
like to focus more on now are the proto

386
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,269
chlorophyll I'd read duct aces pour one

387
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,880
in pour two and this was a real surprise

388
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,609
to us that we found these genes to have

389
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,710
a very large effect in these two genes

390
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:23,029
they're homeo logs in the maize genome

391
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:28,250
explained almost all of the variants for

392
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:30,619
a total to cough Rawls that we found so

393
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,599
why this is intriguing is because these

394
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:35,569
two genes are involved in the

395
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:39,079
chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway so here

396
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:43,009
we have protoporphyrin a the poor gene

397
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,199
is doing a reducing reaction here then

398
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:47,599
we have the chlorophyll ID a which lacks

399
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,860
the final tail then that's added through

400
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:54,949
the GG ear geranyl journal and then we

401
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:57,559
have the chlorophyll a and B right here

402
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,799
and so this is where we begin to

403
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:03,950
hypothesize what may be going on we did

404
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,839
analyze embryo and the India sperm of

405
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,880
these developing maize kernels and we

406
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,819
found trace amounts of chlorophylls

407
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,620
other present in the maize embryo just

408
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:18,289
remind you the maize grain is non green

409
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:21,919
non-photosynthetic so why is chlorophyll

410
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:25,039
in it okay and so when you look here

411
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,320
this is days after pollination here on

412
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,289
a's x-axis sixteen to thirty six days

413
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:33,200
after pollination and this is from the

414
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,720
embryos and this is average across the

415
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,210
25 NAMP errants here and on the y-axis

416
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,299
is the long concentration of each of

417
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,850
these compounds so calls here you can

418
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,149
see is increasing over time but you do

419
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,658
actually see chlorophyll a here or

420
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,028
Philby

421
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:54,919
and then a precursor of chlorophyll lied

422
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:57,659
a and this would be more related to a

423
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,570
degradation product without the

424
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:03,450
magnesium pheophytin a and this is just

425
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:06,749
a remind you what that the final group

426
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,359
here is important for defining

427
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:14,879
chlorophyll a versus chlorophyll I'd a

428
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:17,038
right here but when you think about the

429
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:19,439
amount of chlorophyll that's found in

430
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,690
the embryo versus the leave the

431
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,840
chlorophyll took off for all molar ratio

432
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,960
is one to eight hundred in the embryo

433
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,898
thus we we feel that chlorophyll

434
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,690
degradation is not sufficient as a

435
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:36,089
source of fight all to generate it took

436
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,239
off roles in the developing embryo of

437
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:42,478
maize grain so what we think is

438
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:44,729
happening here is actually a cycle so we

439
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:47,009
we hypothesize that the fight all forty

440
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:49,139
corals and embryos most likely provided

441
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:51,690
through the floor filled biosynthetic

442
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:53,998
pathway so first just to draw your

443
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,869
attention to this plot here this is days

444
00:20:53,999 --> 00:21:00,239
after pollination again and on x-axis

445
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:03,089
and the correlation of each of these

446
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:06,149
different metabolites with the total

447
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:09,089
amount of tocopheryl here and here we

448
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:10,858
see a strong correlation over the

449
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:14,519
developmental time period for

450
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:17,038
chlorophyll a for also chlorophyll I'd a

451
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,460
and chlorophyll b but we need to not see

452
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:24,628
a strong correlation at all and in fact

453
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,509
it is very weak for pheophytin 8a so

454
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:30,898
this reaction right here involving these

455
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:33,269
pores is a strongly light dependent

456
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:35,728
reaction and so what we think is

457
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,788
happening here is that the final group

458
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:41,788
is somehow being cleaved from the

459
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:46,528
chlorophyll a and that it's being used

460
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:48,808
by p te v and the fight over e salvaging

461
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:54,028
pathway and that is what's leaving to

462
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:56,638
cough rawls and here if the degradation

463
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:58,798
of the fight all was very important and

464
00:21:56,638 --> 00:22:01,378
very strong we would think and

465
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,160
hypothesize that the pheophytin a signal

466
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:04,589
here

467
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,490
be very strong but we're not seeing that

468
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:09,179
at all and so for this cycle to actually

469
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,130
happen

470
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,150
we have hypothesized that or at least

471
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,640
one or two more enzymes here to to cause

472
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,350
this cycle to actually turn and and we

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,780
have some leads and and we've cloned

474
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:24,899
genes now that we think are filling out

475
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,910
this pathway part right here one other

476
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,680
thing is that we have tested out in this

477
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,750
field in in the field season this year

478
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,029
and also last year since this is a

479
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,450
strong a light dependent reaction what

480
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:39,089
we did is after pollination yeah it was

481
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,400
about 5 to 10 days after pollination so

482
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:44,159
we have our pollination bag on the ear

483
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,380
we have these foil hats that we're

484
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,259
putting on the ear so no light can

485
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,820
penetrate the ear at all and then after

486
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:55,319
you know comes off October and the first

487
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:58,019
snowfall we go out there and harvest and

488
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,359
then we take off those foil hats we make

489
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,160
sure that there was no penetration of

490
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,829
light and then we analyzed the samples

491
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,620
with the HPLC and so what we found here

492
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:11,369
to test this hypothesis is we think if

493
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:13,529
it is an important reaction in involving

494
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:15,989
these poor genes that if you block out

495
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,819
the light then the amount of the copper

496
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,829
all should decrease as well and that's

497
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:23,450
what we saw in the first year and we're

498
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:26,699
just reconfirming this year as well and

499
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:29,640
so to to complement that we've also been

500
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,279
doing CRISPR of these two four genes as

501
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,320
well but as you would expect if you

502
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,240
CRISPR two important genes in a

503
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,849
chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway you

504
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,049
would expect for the crisp red plants to

505
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:45,599
be very pale and berry green so we are

506
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:47,759
treating these plants as they are our

507
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,980
own children and we're trying to ensure

508
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,960
that we actually get seed from them and

509
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:56,759
hopefully we'll be analyzing those by

510
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,920
HPLC as as well this coming spring so

511
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,420
that's that's our hypothesis that we're

512
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,539
trying to confirm now with the

513
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,700
chlorophyll cycle so the largest effect

514
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,589
QTL for the toca chrome and all pathway

515
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,890
has technically been resolved to the

516
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:12,779
gene level and could be deployed in

517
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,990
breeding programs but as you see here it

518
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:18,058
is still a fair amount of unresolved QTL

519
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,700
right near right now and this is what

520
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,539
we're following up and on our PG RP

521
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,509
pathway grant right now and this is work

522
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:34,740
is being carried out by d wu and j wu li

523
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:36,839
and in our lab right now and mat Shu has

524
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,299
been talking about this for about the

525
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,629
the past four years we are trying to

526
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,589
leverage all of our investment in

527
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,950
understanding the genetic architecture

528
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:49,859
of carotenoids and tokomon also

529
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,799
providing a vitamin E and important

530
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:55,699
Sante bills lutein is the assassin to

531
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,099
improve your sweet corn I know it's like

532
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,660
winter and there's snow on the ground

533
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:03,178
think about eating more highly

534
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,840
nutritious or and of course covered in

535
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:09,720
butter and in the coming summers so now

536
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:13,889
we we have done close to about two 200

537
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,990
crosses and and we now have identified

538
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,840
in important genes that are also key

539
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,359
players such as like e-trade R b1 h TG t

540
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,919
1 V T you want to be to you for and when

541
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,859
you think about you can have these

542
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,590
important haplotypes fixed as your

543
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:31,069
cofactors and your GS models and then

544
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:34,558
you have can have the poly gene effect

545
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:37,139
capturing that residual variance and in

546
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,569
fact the prediction ability for these

547
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,540
phenotypes can be quite high and in our

548
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:44,428
breeding population so I in fact do have

549
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:47,009
a breeding program even though it's hard

550
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,840
to believe some sometimes when I find

551
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,730
time we're actually out in the field and

552
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,259
it's it can be some very tasty

553
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,099
phenotyping if you ever want to come

554
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,629
join us in terms of quality traits and

555
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:59,490
so now I'm gonna begin to switch gears

556
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,260
to some of the high throughput

557
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,150
phenotyping work that we've also been

558
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:07,349
doing in my lab over the past 10 years

559
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,600
and this was driven out by having some

560
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:12,480
early discussions when I was doing my

561
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:15,058
PhD here with with John Luke when we

562
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,670
were I was at still trying to figure out

563
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:20,399
what is genomic selection so I would

564
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,558
chat with John Luke he would be like

565
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,929
it's you know your genotype and

566
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,970
phenotype them you know a population

567
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,310
this training population you train a a

568
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,450
GS model and

569
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:34,710
ideally you genotype your breeding

570
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,319
material and try to predict what those

571
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,630
phenotypes actually are but even though

572
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,869
you're doing that you still need highly

573
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:45,030
accurate phenotypes and you still have

574
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:47,339
to be doing phenotypes as you retrain

575
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:49,710
the models after say every three or four

576
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:53,279
cycles as the allele frequencies are

577
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:56,610
changing and why I began working on this

578
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,289
because in Arizona I was very focused on

579
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:02,099
trying to improve the heat and drought

580
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,490
stress tolerance of cotton and as as

581
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:07,799
with new nutrition I think about

582
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:11,069
children and the the body mints they're

583
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:16,759
not receiving but in this case during

584
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:19,679
the early part of 2010 through 2012

585
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:22,559
there have been repeated droughts and

586
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,200
including in Texas here in in 2012 we're

587
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,190
a humble cotton farmer can just lose

588
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,080
their in entire crop from drought and so

589
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,059
what I quickly began realizing is we

590
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,009
needed a very effective way to do

591
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,950
Hydrabad phenotyping for heat and

592
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:40,019
drought tolerance in in the field and

593
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,210
how we began doing this when I was

594
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:44,490
working at the USDA was having this high

595
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,279
clearance tractor right here to

596
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,559
phenotype canopy temperature in dbi

597
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,109
which is basically a vegetation index

598
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,210
doing like chlorophyll content if you

599
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:57,419
will

600
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,950
biomass and then height and then we were

601
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,890
testing this on a recombinant inbred

602
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,100
line population of cotton close to 100

603
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,690
recombinant lines we had also phenotype

604
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:10,199
agronomic traits at the end of the

605
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,610
season with a combine or cotton picker

606
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,309
going through the field and various

607
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:17,039
yield components fiber quality traits

608
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:19,409
and physiological leaf traits EPS Isak

609
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,240
acid and and the sizing acid

610
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,590
concentration was here at Cornell thanks

611
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,920
to Tim Sutter and we were doing all this

612
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:32,009
under drip irrigation so we can have a

613
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,440
highly managed stress environment and we

614
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:36,359
would calculate how long and how much of

615
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,700
the irrigation should be applied for

616
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,369
these two wet and dry regimes right here

617
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,200
and we were able to do this phenotyping

618
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:45,869
over the entire growing

619
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,120
season so say we would phenotype every

620
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:50,819
Thursday and then we would do at four

621
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,129
time points within that single day over

622
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:56,099
the whole growing season so in a sense

623
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:59,549
we really wanted to understand how is

624
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:02,069
this particular population responding to

625
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:05,638
the imposed heat and drought stress over

626
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:08,490
time from at flowering to at the end of

627
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:10,558
harvest when a a cotton picker would

628
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,409
drive through the field and quantify

629
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:16,200
yield and so what we were able to do

630
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:20,190
this is essentially paint the the genome

631
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,580
to see what QTL are turned on and off as

632
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:26,580
as a result from the dry stress though

633
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:29,699
wet well water controlled treatment and

634
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:33,000
on the x-axis year is the year so we did

635
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,929
this over three years 2010 2011 2012 and

636
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,339
this x-axis here is the position of long

637
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:40,440
two genomes each of these are a

638
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:44,668
chromosome and so would you can easily

639
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:48,058
see here in this very almost crazy

640
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:50,759
painting if you will is that you can see

641
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:52,379
the the time points when certain QTL are

642
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,629
turned on and how long that they're

643
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,269
turned on for and then you can kind of

644
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:02,399
see if they're turned on between years

645
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:04,649
and across years as as well and the the

646
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,750
red are alleles that are increasing the

647
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,699
canopy temperature and the blue are

648
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,700
alleles that are decreasing the canopy

649
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,149
temperature and this work was carried

650
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,190
out by a former postdoc here is now at

651
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:21,028
the University of Arizona as a new

652
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,048
professor so here we have a nice Canada

653
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,869
gene ABA

654
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:27,000
but this is a large genome ik interval

655
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:28,859
here but with a candidate gene you can

656
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,769
always hypothesize what may be happening

657
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:34,678
and why ABA may be important is in this

658
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:36,990
context because when we had mapped the

659
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,538
cotton leaf ABA content the key field

660
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,210
mapped to the same genomic location as

661
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:44,940
this QTL that was turned on very

662
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:49,558
strongly for canopy temperature why that

663
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:53,100
is important is as the stomata are open

664
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:55,079
transpiration is high and as ABA is

665
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,658
expressed in the leaf and becomes

666
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,178
through high concentration

667
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,730
actual stomata closed and transpiration

668
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,830
decreases so in effect this could very

669
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,110
much have some be somehow linked to

670
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:09,089
changes in the canopy temperature in

671
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:12,538
terms of variation in this cotton

672
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:16,158
recombinant inbred law in population but

673
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:20,129
that is just indirect phenotyping of a

674
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,020
trait such as really what you're trying

675
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:25,169
to get at is the amount of water in a

676
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:27,359
leaf so what we've been doing over the

677
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:31,140
past few years working with Wigan Lou

678
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:34,139
and my lab and fuschia John and a Brooks

679
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,509
lab is developing these nano sensors

680
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,240
that we call aqua dust to infiltrate

681
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:42,210
into the leaves to more directly

682
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,400
quantify water potential so how this is

683
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,788
working as these have these like small

684
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,740
floor for particles that are hooked on

685
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:52,408
to these particles and when you

686
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,558
infiltrate into the the actual leave

687
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,470
they will expand and contract based on

688
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,779
the leaf water potential so if the water

689
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,089
potential is very low that means the

690
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,158
plant the plant is undergoing stress and

691
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:07,740
so then you would have shrinkage of

692
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,570
these nano particles and then these fret

693
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,829
particles would be an to interact with

694
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:14,129
each other and then you would have a

695
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:16,379
high fluorescence signal and we also did

696
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,419
validation and we were showing here in

697
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,360
this curve so this is like water

698
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,070
potential from a pressure chamber it

699
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,369
you've also made me heard it referred to

700
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:31,349
as a pressure bomb so all this is an

701
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:33,359
actual work that you actually have to

702
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:35,428
leg cut the leaf off and put it into

703
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,889
pressure problems and quantify this but

704
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,900
on the y-axis here is a fret efficiency

705
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,480
of those particles and you see it's

706
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,370
following this line very well so what

707
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,880
this gave us confidence in telling us

708
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:50,548
that we are able to directly measure

709
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,590
leaf water potential in the leaf using

710
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:55,440
these nanoparticles and this is a

711
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:59,099
confocal image here showing the

712
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,880
distribution of these nanoparticles in

713
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:06,389
the leaf themself and you can see that

714
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,490
the Aqua dust is residing in the April

715
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,780
plastic region and really what it's

716
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,660
doing is providing a measure of the low

717
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,369
water potential in that leaf so this is

718
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,350
really I think one of the first steps to

719
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:20,399
really begin high throughput phenotyping

720
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:22,869
of water potential and it's direct

721
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,550
quantification of water potential so we

722
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,409
wouldn't have to do it through canopy

723
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,869
temperature we wouldn't have to do it

724
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:33,400
with the pressure bomb this is injecting

725
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:35,379
particles in the leaf so the next part

726
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,759
is going to be about biotic stress and

727
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,580
this is what happens when you hang out

728
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,980
with Rebecca Nelson you begin working on

729
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:44,769
northern leaf flight so as I've become

730
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,299
to learn and actually call these lesions

731
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,339
beautiful because when they're not

732
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:50,710
showing up in our field in a season if

733
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:53,500
it's not beautiful as we have found out

734
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:57,430
this past summer so the fungus that

735
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,500
causes these Brown product lesions these

736
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:02,789
these lesions can begin you know to grow

737
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,940
and coalesce over over time and

738
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:09,460
unfortunately NLB disease as actually be

739
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,490
beginning to increase over time since

740
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,918
since 2012 and it can be high as a 1.9

741
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:16,388
billion economic loss and that was the

742
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,719
case in 2015

743
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:23,590
considering US and Ontario so this is

744
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,388
really a disease on the rise and one of

745
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,820
the challenges here and the sliminess

746
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,610
work really began with Jesse Poland when

747
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,850
he was here as a PhD student at the same

748
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,490
time was is really how do you rapidly

749
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:39,190
visually assess it'll be a disease

750
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,928
presence or severity which is a

751
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,809
quantitative phenotype out in the field

752
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,148
and it often is very slow and imprecise

753
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:48,878
so here we have the case where this is

754
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:51,638
our NLB true positive this or in OB true

755
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,569
negative but even just trying to see

756
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,820
these lesions by eye

757
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,400
assuming you're able to find a positive

758
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,670
one is very slow as you walk through the

759
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,769
field and then quantitatively is also

760
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,110
very challenging when you're trying to

761
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,509
do severity which is in the sense

762
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:11,099
disease leaf area is here this is the

763
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,770
case of mean interrater radio bility

764
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:17,710
repeatability of only 0.76 so this is

765
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:20,739
like comparing the same repeater to

766
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:24,090
themselves going from say in week one or

767
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:27,449
I'm sorry week ten to week 12 and then

768
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:30,480
seeing how close their ratings relate

769
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:33,659
and then the inter-rater repeatability

770
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,059
is actually even lower so this is not

771
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,589
only slow but it is imprecise when

772
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,529
you're trying to do it quantitatively

773
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,360
for diseased looped area so the the idea

774
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,430
that we had and this is where hanging

775
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,820
out with computer sciences computer

776
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:49,469
scientists and engineers is very

777
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,850
sometimes intimidating to learn their

778
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,629
language and understand what they're

779
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,730
talking about

780
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,500
at first but as soon as you get out

781
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,210
you're your comfort zone and you realize

782
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,889
that they can do so much more to help

783
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,119
your research then I'm hanging out with

784
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,429
them all the time and having

785
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,400
conversations with them every week so

786
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:07,440
the idea was and and this is what a lot

787
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,559
of people will refer to as machine

788
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,030
learning deep learning and this is using

789
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,789
these C and in sand you can just think

790
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,269
about using a CNN this converting and

791
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:20,789
pixel into a logistic unit one zero

792
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:22,590
presence absence of a lesion and what

793
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,480
this essentially doing is where we're

794
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,950
applying these filters to detect

795
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,260
features and that's what is referred to

796
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,969
as a convolution and then the pooling is

797
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,500
really simplifying the layers you're

798
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:36,480
trying to convince this information to

799
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,760
allow more filters to be applied and

800
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,710
then you're extracting these multiple

801
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,960
layers of the non feature and then

802
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,179
almost like an ensemble classifier is

803
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,269
combining all these features to make a

804
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:51,509
prediction at the end either deletion is

805
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:54,269
present or it's not and so what we've

806
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,420
been doing and this has been carried out

807
00:36:54,269 --> 00:37:00,719
by our wonderful pilot Nick has more in

808
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,420
the lab is using the UAVs to really

809
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,669
speed up the large-scale disease

810
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,829
detection in the field and here's one of

811
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,909
those UAV images right here of some

812
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:15,599
really nice lesions on on these plants

813
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:16,889
and working with Hans group at Columbia

814
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,009
University

815
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:22,980
Harvey Wu and Chad Deshawn and tear here

816
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,410
at Cornell we've been able to do highly

817
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,500
accurate and OB lesion detection here so

818
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:30,299
after we have our trained cnn's we've

819
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,170
been able to achieve an accuracy of

820
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,930
almost almost 98% with a holdout test so

821
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,980
we were actually able to detect these

822
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:40,199
lesions the presence

823
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,809
of absence of them very well out in the

824
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,269
field but we really want to do severity

825
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:47,219
we want to make Rebecca Nelson happy and

826
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:48,780
so this is what we've been trying to do

827
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:53,549
over the past two years is make her

828
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,380
happy and we're getting closer so the

829
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,080
the great people at Facebook have

830
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,650
developed what is called a mask regional

831
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,480
CNN short for mask our CNN so this is

832
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,820
what we began doing and this work is led

833
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,400
by Ethan Stewart in our lab and so you

834
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,859
can see a nice lab photo right here of

835
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,260
us all happy and smiley and then we can

836
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,329
run that mask our CNN here and then it's

837
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,910
running these classifiers so the idea

838
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,619
here is you're conducting object

839
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:21,539
detection by drawing these bounding

840
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,820
boxes around each class and then you're

841
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,519
doing like a segmentation algorithm on

842
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:31,050
each of these bounding boxes to classify

843
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:34,500
a pixel as as an object so what Ethan

844
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:36,539
has been doing is really trying to carry

845
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,369
this forward in into the plant world

846
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:39,840
from from the Facebook world and see

847
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:42,570
roots here we have an image of a

848
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,640
diseased lesion here and here is where

849
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,190
it's been outlined by a human being and

850
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,349
this is where the masks are CNN would

851
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,780
predict that there's one lesion here and

852
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:54,900
then drawing the area around that one

853
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,910
lesion and then the iou is the overlap

854
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,400
in that area so this one actually looks

855
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:02,339
fairly well but there are cases when it

856
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,200
does not look very well and this looks

857
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:07,680
like we have a piece of an anther or a

858
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,289
tassel here occluding this lesion right

859
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,299
here which is where a human drew it very

860
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:15,779
nicely here and drew a part of this

861
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,900
lesion here but as you see this piece of

862
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,690
attachable is kind of confounding the AI

863
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,800
so to overcome that we just need a

864
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,710
larger training set and Ethan may have

865
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,680
to drink more coffee

866
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:34,440
so after that so with the UAVs what

867
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:39,329
we've begun working now within an Ed's

868
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:41,880
group here is Cornell and it's trying to

869
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:44,039
really understand how you use robotics

870
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,858
for phenotyping and incorporate them

871
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,989
into clamp reading programs and this is

872
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:50,819
with rich Choudhary's group at a

873
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,299
university Illinois urbana-champaign and

874
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,570
this

875
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,260
on our Tara MEP project from funded by

876
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,860
the rpe

877
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:01,500
so the 10 was to develop this for

878
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:04,430
phenotyping biomass sorghum over over

879
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,300
time and so what we're now developing

880
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:10,799
with our lab is a comparative hapmap and

881
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,930
that's trying to integrate the

882
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,110
evolutionary histories of maize and

883
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:18,529
sorghum to improve the predictions of

884
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:21,240
these complex traits in sorghum and

885
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:24,000
Jonathan here is four here from one year

886
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:28,079
from Brazil what he's beginning to do is

887
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,570
develop these Bayesian models that can

888
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,730
use what is referred to as forward

889
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,530
training cross-validation where you can

890
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,599
say have a robot going through the field

891
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,700
but then you're incorporating these time

892
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,250
points early in the season as part of

893
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,319
your training set to try to predict a

894
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:46,050
phenotype at the end of the season

895
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,780
so in this case this is height and we're

896
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:53,940
using days after planting 30 and 45 days

897
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:56,280
to train the actual Bayesian model we're

898
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,460
using that information to predict height

899
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,830
at the end of the season and that as we

900
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,929
found been able to increase our

901
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:06,150
prediction accuracy so when you think

902
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:08,669
about a Hydrabad phenotyping approach

903
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,190
can you begin to corporate phenotypes

904
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,200
early in the season to improve your

905
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,599
accuracy so you can predict something

906
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,639
such as height or yield more accurately

907
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,380
at the end of the season so you can

908
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,049
think of this as saving time then you

909
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,960
would know early on what crosses to make

910
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:28,280
early in the season F prior to flowering

911
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,619
and as Jonathan has also shown at

912
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,870
certainly later weeks after planting

913
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,789
there isn't much changing in the rank

914
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:41,009
order of of those plants for height and

915
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:44,489
having a robot makes you very happy as I

916
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:47,220
have found and IDI would probably a test

917
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:49,649
to that as well so what we're really

918
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,869
beginning to think about and do here is

919
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:55,289
trying to integrate these unmanned

920
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:57,179
ground vehicles these unmanned aerial

921
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:59,759
vehicles to really tandem Li phenotype

922
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,500
and it'll be disease presence and

923
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,600
severity from the understory to the

924
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,989
canopy because I have now learned that

925
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,909
the N OB disease

926
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,949
starts at the understory and it works

927
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:12,099
its way up if you're seeing it from the

928
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:14,409
air it actually may be too late

929
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:16,868
so what we're now trying to work on is

930
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:18,429
do in sync phenotyping approach where

931
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,170
we're trying to integrate the

932
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:24,779
information from the ground rovers and

933
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:28,869
the UAV to really understand the rate of

934
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:34,480
disease Pro progression over the whole

935
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:36,490
growing season and with that in mind and

936
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,650
this is where hanging out with computer

937
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:40,689
scientists can can be very fun we're

938
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,329
really thinking about now a concept of a

939
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:47,380
software-defined farm where you're you

940
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:50,230
are using the TV white space and a

941
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,800
software called farm beats using that to

942
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:55,570
eventually do into in image processing

943
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,690
nearly in real time as you're collecting

944
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:02,890
you the UAV data or from the ground

945
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:05,289
rover to really understand how diseases

946
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:08,289
are breaking out and how you would

947
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:11,050
better manage your your crop and this is

948
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,239
under the umbrella of Sita and this is

949
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:16,210
with my colleague Hakeem and computer

950
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,189
science so this is kind of where we are

951
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,500
beginning to see and take hydrogen

952
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,970
phenotyping where it was once just

953
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,250
thought of maybe we would just focus on

954
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:27,219
one trait but it's really now beginning

955
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:30,000
to think how do we fully integrate this

956
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:33,129
in a breeding program but how do we

957
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,099
employ it so you also better manage our

958
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,349
crop at the farm level and how do we

959
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,089
sense and react at the same time because

960
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:43,420
then you can think about having like a

961
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:45,760
UAV or a a ground Weaver which the

962
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,309
highly concentrated candor serves of

963
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,170
like fungicide or a pesticide that can

964
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:53,529
have a variable application through the

965
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:55,000
field over time and that's where to have

966
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,530
that actually to be possible would

967
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,340
require something as a software-defined

968
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,400
farm

969
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,400
that there's a lot of people to thank

970
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,530
and funding agencies for the carotenoid

971
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,599
work would be at MSU and Purdue

972
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:12,200
University and here at Cornell with Ed's

973
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:15,579
group the like CNN disease work would be

974
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:19,460
hard to group at Columbia University Rob

975
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:23,329
focus group here at Cornell and for the

976
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,730
earth since that would be our Rover and

977
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:27,590
then the phenotyping early work was

978
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,559
involving colleagues at the University

979
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:32,120
Arizona and USDA a lark and

980
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,000
unfortunately I did not have enough time

981
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,099
to talk about the other 20 projects that

982
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,570
we have going on in the lab because I

983
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:40,909
didn't want this presentation to be just

984
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:43,850
one slide for each project but we're

985
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:46,279
also doing some I think some great work

986
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:48,110
and oat and cassava as well and other

987
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,590
projects and in maize but unfortunately

988
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,910
I just didn't have the time to go do a

989
00:44:50,590 --> 00:45:13,460
fast forward through all those projects

990
00:44:52,909 --> 00:45:17,109
I thank you very much no that's actually

991
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:22,789
something we looked at very early on and

992
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:24,590
so DX s2 and D X s3 are kind of the the

993
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:27,800
only shared I'll just call them

994
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:30,769
precursor genes and there isn't that

995
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:34,130
much pleiotropy as we like previously

996
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:35,840
thought one one thing and and harvest

997
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,480
plus is probably going to begin

998
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,019
hopefully breeding for this is that

999
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,630
since some of the tocotrienols are very

1000
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:46,820
strong antioxidants that you can breed

1001
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,860
for them at the same time to help

1002
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,530
prevent the breakdown of pro-vitamin a

1003
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:53,780
and in the maize brain and that has been

1004
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,030
shown as sorghum transgenic ly by the

1005
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,040
pioneer group but i actually think we

1006
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:02,019
can do that through breeding in maize as

1007
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:02,019
well great question

1008
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:09,568
yes Susan I'm trying to process the idea

1009
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:11,608
that chlorophyll indeed if I understood

1010
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:15,239
it in the embryo yes correct

1011
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:17,548
I'm just curious how light gets to the

1012
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,969
embryo within the kernel on the cob

1013
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:24,449
through the house and I and I've been

1014
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:27,239
I'm sorry but must be obvious it's not

1015
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:29,669
obvious it's there is a very low level

1016
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:34,019
of light that can print it rate the husk

1017
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,970
leaves we've we have found but how much

1018
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,009
light is needed I don't think it

1019
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:39,358
requires that not much but that is

1020
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,420
something that we're trying to figure

1021
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,269
out and follow up on so we we have also

1022
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,548
done I guess the counter part of our

1023
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:50,280
test you know how we had foil on the

1024
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:52,798
cobs we've also had ears where we took

1025
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,710
off almost all of the husk leaves and

1026
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:58,230
our hypothesis is that the two controls

1027
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,818
should go up even higher and that's well

1028
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:07,139
I hope they have the answer to you in

1029
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:10,739
like a couple months oh that's a good

1030
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:11,519
question I do not know yeah that's a

1031
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:13,259
great question

1032
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,269
it's it's quite possible since it is

1033
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,940
going through like pale green husk

1034
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:35,068
leaves yeah that's that's very possible

1035
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:39,900
yeah so okay so that's what I get for

1036
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:42,358
bringing that up okay that's a great

1037
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:46,108
question so what we're actually creating

1038
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:50,429
here is a comparative hapmap and so you

1039
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:54,028
can think about the diversity of sorghum

1040
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:57,480
right pie right so what we're doing is

1041
00:47:54,028 --> 00:48:00,690
using a machine learning model where we

1042
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,019
have all the different sorghum Popkin

1043
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:06,349
parameters such as row you know other

1044
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:09,838
recombination rates and you know other

1045
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:12,630
genomic features but what we found is as

1046
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,719
we look at the synthetic regions between

1047
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,750
maize and sorghum where you say getting

1048
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,230
pie and

1049
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:22,750
gene expression from Mays as well we're

1050
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,699
able to better predict the diversity

1051
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,909
patterns of swaram using that

1052
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:30,759
information so I think if this is the

1053
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:33,099
case where you are able to harness the

1054
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,610
scent in acree jhin's that are more

1055
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:39,940
stable and shared and so the idea is

1056
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:43,269
perhaps there'll be some of the shared

1057
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:48,700
if you will control those complex trade

1058
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:51,670
variation at the same time and we've

1059
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:54,519
been playing around with this and maize

1060
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:57,579
and rice for the control of say like

1061
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:59,409
iron and zinc variation weave it's

1062
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:02,489
actually kind of turning out to be very

1063
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:06,460
cool and very powerful where we have

1064
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:08,859
orthology between the two and then we're

1065
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,780
like okay there's jia sit here do you

1066
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,539
I'll sit here then we're able to kind of

1067
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:16,390
tease that out by just having like rice

1068
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:17,889
and in maize and so you can kind of

1069
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:22,739
think of it as the same way when you're

1070
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:22,739
using maize and sorghum as well

1071
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:37,599
yeah other questions sorry Jen why I

1072
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:42,340
can't hear ya sorry I I like have to

1073
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:45,009
walk all the way ah yeah that's that's a

1074
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,430
good question so the question was for

1075
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:51,940
the NLB lesions can you distinguish them

1076
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:53,649
from other abiotic stresses and and so

1077
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,900
we've we've actually I guess taken the

1078
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:59,710
easy route where we've just been

1079
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,630
focusing on lesions but we know all

1080
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:05,340
those lesions are just caused by the one

1081
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:07,990
pathogen right i I think as we begin to

1082
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,519
expand out and have this to be something

1083
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,519
that's more transferable and more

1084
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,110
valuable either thing about having the

1085
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,079
test of when there's like multiple

1086
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:20,170
diseases present and in the combination

1087
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:21,670
of abiotic stress as well but the the

1088
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,889
thing is though and the thing you have

1089
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:27,550
to keep in mind at this present time the

1090
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:30,460
humans are training the AIS so if the

1091
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,260
human can't distinguish the two or two

1092
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,539
three or the four then it's going to be

1093
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,030
very hard to train to a is sure over

1094
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:38,829
time as AI strain themself they may be

1095
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:43,950
able to figure it out but we're not

1096
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:43,949
quite there yet yeah good question

1097
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:59,470
this has been a production of Cornell

1098
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:59,470
University on the web at Cornell edu
