1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,160
University uh no it's great to be here

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,959
um and today I'm going to tell you a

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
little bit about the work that my lab

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,640
does on plant ecology and public health

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,720
so the mission of my group is to

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,359
quantify plant human interactions to

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:30,399
informed decision making and ultimately

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,039
to improve Public Health

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:36,238
to do so we seek to answer questions

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,600
including how can we measure model and

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,878
scale up processes that are Health

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,520
relevant we also seek to answer what are

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,159
the public health consequences of plants

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,280
and who is most affected by them and

16
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,679
ultimately we seek to use this

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,079
information and to leverage it to inform

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:01,518
decisions that will improve human

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,198
health so there's a lot of different

20
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:07,039
ways in which plants interact with

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,599
people from a health

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,880
perspective in our day-to-day lives we

23
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,478
may benefit from the cooling effects of

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,839
trees on a hot day or from the more

25
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,799
subtle but still important removal of

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,400
air pollutants like particulate matter

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,960
by Urban

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,359
plants these plants also have all sorts

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,519
of other effects too everything from

30
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,319
mental health benefits to uh

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,560
hydrological effects like that can

32
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,679
reduce flooding in urban

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,000
areas of course these plants also have

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
negative effects too such as the

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,280
production of allergenic pollen uh or

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,280
the production of volatile organic

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,200
compounds uh which uh contribute to

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,560
Ozone

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,040
formation today I'm mostly going to tell

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,320
you about uh one of these in particular

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,118
which is allergenic pollen so I'm going

42
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,038
to go a little bit into why this is

43
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,920
important and what we're doing about it

44
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,680
and then I'll talk about uh some other

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,840
stuff that I do too as

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,000
well so most of what we know about

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,878
Airborne pollen comes from empirical

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,039
measurements uh taken uh across the

49
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:21,439
United States by the sparse monitoring

50
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,799
Network to give you a sense of how this

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,560
works I'm going to zoom into the

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,000
fingerlakes region so we are over here

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,039
in Ithaca and the nearest of these

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,439
pollen monitoring stations to us is up

55
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:38,959
in Rochester which is about 80 miles

56
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,639
away from here the way it works is uh

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,560
there's a sampler that looks kind of

58
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,158
like this on top of the roof of a single

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,920
building up there and this sampler draws

60
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,560
in air that has pollen and fungal spores

61
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,919
and other things like that on in it and

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,239
then once a day a technician goes up to

63
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,000
that rooftop takes the sample out of the

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,519
device manually identifies the pollen

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,158
grains and then reports that information

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,879
to the

67
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:12,479
media now uh what does this mean if you

68
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,759
live in say Fall Creek well there's a

69
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,079
few pieces to this

70
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,560
unfortunately

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,040
uh what was measured in Rochester in the

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,959
morning that was those measurements were

73
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,759
taken over the previous 24-hour periods

74
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,319
so you're talking about yesterday's data

75
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,079
also pollen concentrations Vari by

76
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,238
orders of magnitude over spatial scales

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,959
of hundreds of meters and so what's

78
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,519
happening 100 kilometers away isn't

79
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,878
going to give you very useful

80
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,400
information about what is going to

81
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,199
happen today for you here in Etha um and

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,519
so without that information you may not

83
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,238
be able to make behavioral decisions

84
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,239
like uh deciding whether you're going

85
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,680
for a run that day or whether you should

86
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,959
close your windows and it also doesn't

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,719
really tell you whether you should take

88
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,920
uh your allergy medication uh which is

89
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,199
important because a lot of these

90
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:11,518
medications take at least 24 or 48 hours

91
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,878
to hit full efficacy now for a lot of

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,959
people who have allergies and this is a

93
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:22,759
lot of people uh somewhere around uh 20

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,160
25% of Americans um for folks that have

95
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,720
allergies this merely makes them

96
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,880
miserable right but there's a lot of

97
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,120
people out there who have asthma or

98
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,519
chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder

99
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,478
and for these people exposure to pollen

100
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,560
can be much more

101
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:44,800
serious so there's a real need for

102
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,478
creating models of Airborne pollen and

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,000
that is what a lot of my work focuses on

104
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:55,079
and so I do a few different uh things in

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,199
order to generate these models um I make

106
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,198
use of

107
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,560
um I do a lot of field work

108
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,080
um and I also use remote sensing uh

109
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,360
ranging from drones to satellites to try

110
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,478
and understand things like uh where are

111
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,720
the plants that are producing pollen how

112
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,758
much pollen is being produced when is it

113
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,360
being released and ultimately how does

114
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,759
it uh disperse through the

115
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,840
air these are all of the ingredients

116
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,919
necessary for creating process-based

117
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,318
models of Airborne pollen concentrations

118
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,159
and ultimately this is what we need to

119
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,360
do in order to get this uh information

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,199
and predictions about pollen

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,319
concentrations out to relevant

122
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,360
stakeholders uh as well as people with

123
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,759
allergies who can use this information

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,038
to improve their health so I'm now going

125
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,360
to take just a tiny bit of time to uh

126
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,519
tell you about uh what this looks like

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,400
in practice and so some of this might

128
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:02,038
involve things like uh using the the

129
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:05,758
color of these uh pollen cones uh for

130
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:08,839
this uh species in Texas to to try and

131
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,240
um uh scale up predictions of pollen

132
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,439
production uh this is uh Hannah who's a

133
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,759
graduate student in my lab and doing a

134
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,879
fantastic job of trying to use these

135
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,160
remote sensing indices to understand

136
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:26,199
this um at spatial scales ranging from

137
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,000
meters uh up to site level and

138
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,879
eventually as we incorporate more

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,279
satellite data to even larger scales uh

140
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,279
and so this is kind of an example of

141
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,918
some of what's done in my lab we also do

142
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,758
a little bit of work on other things

143
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,839
besides pollen U and so one of the the

144
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,240
topics that we're working on right now

145
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,318
is trying to understand the cooling

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,918
effects of trees uh a little bit better

147
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,919
so that we can keep people out of the

148
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,038
emergency department during heat waves

149
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,799
and this is some work that's uh so far

150
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:05,038
mostly focusing on New York City um so

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,319
these are a few examples uh plenty of

152
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,399
other ones everything from um uh

153
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,319
identifying individual trees with remote

154
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:17,159
sensing data to um understanding

155
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,400
correlations between Urban Tree

156
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,400
composition and neighborhood uh

157
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:27,439
demography uh of people that is things

158
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,198
like income and race and ethnicity um

159
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,399
and I also do a little bit of some other

160
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,800
stuff like creating novel devices U

161
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,638
messing around with arduinos and trying

162
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,360
to to come up with the tools that I need

163
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,439
in order to uh take the measurements

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,479
that are

165
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:49,680
required so I suppose with that

166
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:52,360
um I would also like to uh highlight

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,759
some of the the other folks that are in

168
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,400
my lab with me doing this work including

169
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,520
Hannah uh ziville Dave Miller U and

170
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,638
several other students as well and if

171
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,318
any of this is interesting to you come

172
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,560
and stop by we're up on the 10th floor

173
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:13,720
of Bradfield we'd love to chitchat with

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:16,959
you all about uh any of these topics U

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,639
thanks so any

176
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,158
questions you think the pollen data can

177
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,598
be used as an indicator of ecological

178
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,399
Health oh it's certainly useful for a

179
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,918
lot of ecology that's how I got into

180
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:34,158
this my background is PL ecology um and

181
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,838
so it can be useful for understanding

182
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:42,879
things like the like phology the timing

183
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:48,200
of life history events um it's

184
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:51,439
I ecosystem health for me it's um I I'd

185
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,440
say for me I I think about it a little

186
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
bit more on the from the perspective of

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,760
like particular types of plants so it

188
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:03,119
can tell you like hey are there a lot of

189
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,159
uh plants in of a particular type in a

190
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,919
particular area and so there's whole

191
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,919
subfields around paleo ecology that use

192
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,759
pollen for that so it it can be quite a

193
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,879
useful tool for particular

194
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,278
things

195
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,320
thanks I have a question so at the state

196
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,720
level the New York state level um is

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,560
there a very robust tension between

198
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,920
those promoting ecosystem services and

199
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,199
cooling of trees and then human health

200
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,759
concerns or is that do those

201
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,278
stakeholders not necessarily meet each

202
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,919
other oh you get all sorts of

203
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:37,838
interesting politics right because

204
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,399
there's a lot of people including me who

205
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,120
think trees are great and we should have

206
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,519
a lot of them in cities right uh there's

207
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,799
uh1 and a half billion dollars going

208
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,600
into community and urban forestry right

209
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,399
now through the inflation reduction act

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,839
um so we have a lot of people who care a

211
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,078
lot about trees and want them uh in

212
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,040
cities and so sometimes people get a

213
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,359
little offended when you say hey they do

214
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,838
bad things too and so there are some

215
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,600
folks who would rather ignore anything

216
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,040
bad uh for me I think you really need to

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
take both the good and the bad we them

218
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,519
all against each other to make good

219
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,480
decisions so thanks for the invitation

220
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,440
to speak with you all um I'm Jenny Moore

221
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,759
and I'm a an assistant professor in

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
plant breeding and genetics um and today

223
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,720
I'll be giving an overview of my labs

224
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,199
work uh which focuses on plant breeding

225
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,759
for sustainable cropping systems and

226
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,240
we're housed in the plant reading and

227
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,759
genetic section but um excuse me we also

228
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,278
tread into the um disciplines of

229
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,159
agronomy and agricology integrating

230
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,838
management and social science questions

231
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,838
along with our genetics and breeding

232
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,480
work um and before I start I want to

233
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,000
acknowledge the contributions of the

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,200
staff and graduate students and many

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,919
undergrads that have worked in my lab

236
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,360
over the last four years since I started

237
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,719
at Cornell um our work is um spanning

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,120
disciplines and we work on a lot of

239
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,720
different crops and systems and do a lot

240
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,200
of field work and all kinds of weather

241
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,560
so it's a it's a really adapt adaptable

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,320
and Hardy and hardworking bunch of folks

243
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,399
that are that are working on these

244
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,320
projects um so plant breeding for

245
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,799
sustainable cropping systems this

246
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,160
encompasses um a lot of

247
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,919
different um ideas and practices and so

248
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,159
this term um sustainable cropping

249
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,799
systems encompasses a lot of different

250
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,278
ideas and practices um and I decided to

251
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,759
structure my presentation today around

252
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:35,000
um the lens of soil Health as a specific

253
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,958
um way to think about sustainable

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,759
cropping systems um and thinking about

255
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:44,278
uh reading for characteristics of plants

256
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,759
that that keep this long-term goal of

257
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,799
soil Health in mind um and this

258
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:52,600
framework that I have on the slide here

259
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,479
um it was developed by usda's natural

260
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,639
resources conservation service um

261
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,000
describing um yeah these principles uh

262
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,919
that encompass

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,759
a range of farming practices uh that

264
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:09,319
that maximize living Roots soil cover

265
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:13,159
and biodiversity while minimizing soil

266
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,920
disturbance um and for plant

267
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:20,078
breeders

268
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:22,639
um uh we can approach uh working on

269
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:26,799
these principles and and improving these

270
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,839
practices um with genetics by either um

271
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,759
improving plant traits that that support

272
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,800
sustain ability goals um or uh plant

273
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,559
traits that support farmer adoption of

274
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,359
sustainable practices and I would say uh

275
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,679
my lab we we do some of both um uh

276
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,159
improving sustainability related traits

277
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,159
directly or or thinking about farmer

278
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,559
adoption but we perhaps skew a little

279
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,600
towards the latter approach um thinking

280
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,278
about how we can make it easier for

281
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,839
Farmers to to conduct practices that we

282
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,278
already know um enhanc sustainability

283
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,120
goals

284
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,278
um and so I'm going to structure my

285
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,919
presentation around these four

286
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,320
principles of soil health and the first

287
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:14,838
one that I'll talk about uh is

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,519
maximizing living Roots um which we one

289
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,440
way that we do this in our lab is is

290
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:23,320
breeding perennial forage crops so um

291
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,399
forages are especially important for New

292
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,720
York State uh because of the prominence

293
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,519
of New York's dairy industry and um

294
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
we've seen um despite the many

295
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,799
sustainability benefits that forages can

296
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,679
provide we've seen long-term declines in

297
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:41,000
forage acreage um in New York state and

298
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,239
nationally um this has been consistent

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,399
over many

300
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,639
decades um and I think there's a lot of

301
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,320
factors involved economic and policy

302
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,198
factors um challenges with managing

303
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,120
forages and some of these I think are a

304
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,240
little outside of the scope of what

305
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,879
plant breeding can address but some of

306
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,399
the management factors especially I

307
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,679
think breeding has a contribution to

308
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:06,399
make um one of the main areas that um

309
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:11,078
that or this is

310
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,879
a okay so yeah so so acreage um has been

311
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:18,319
shrinking over the last over a hundred

312
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:22,399
years um or or is is down to to levels

313
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,959
below what they were 100 years ago um

314
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,720
and and one of the factors that has

315
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:32,439
really contributed with um uh

316
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,519
to management challenges and forages is

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,000
um plant establishment so Al Alfa seed

318
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,278
can be pretty expensive and um Farmers

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,600
struggle to consistently establish

320
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,399
stands that are

321
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,759
uniform um and there's a few different

322
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,278
factors that affect establishment one of

323
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,800
them is autotoxicity so that's a a form

324
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,078
of self theopathy so um mature alphalpha

325
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,919
plants produce compounds that suppress

326
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,078
germination and growth of

327
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,078
seedlings um and so it can be especially

328
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
hard when you have a failed stand of

329
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,799
alal foot to then come in and replant

330
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,919
the compounds can stay in the soil and

331
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,479
affect establishment for up to a year

332
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:14,319
after um a stand is

333
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,079
terminated and we've initiated a project

334
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,278
looking at this and we so you can see

335
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:22,359
examples here we've um on the in the top

336
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,679
picture we we have um alphaalpha

337
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,959
seedlings that have been germinated in

338
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,638
distilled water versus in an extract

339
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,758
from alala um TI

340
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,079
and you can see the effect that it has

341
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,600
on on germination and growth of those

342
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,758
seedlings um and so one project that

343
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,040
we're working on is is developing alaa

344
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,519
populations with high and low production

345
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,639
of autotoxic compounds and high and low

346
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,360
susceptibility um so that we can both

347
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,879
understand the fundamental genetic

348
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,039
mechanisms underlying this

349
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:56,759
characteristic and develop varieties

350
00:15:53,039 --> 00:16:00,480
that uh are better able to establish uh

351
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:04,278
following a previous Al Alpa

352
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,360
and um and the next soil Health

353
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,958
principle that we that we work on is is

354
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,318
maximizing soil cover and we approach

355
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,958
this um in by breeding for overwintering

356
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,719
cover crops and um I'm the director of

357
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,000
the national cover crop breeding Network

358
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,959
and this is a group of of plant breeders

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,559
and farmers and agronomists across the

360
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,278
country who are um seeking to develop

361
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,559
new cover crop varieties that are better

362
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,958
adapted to Farmer needs needs and and

363
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:38,000
Regional conditions and uh we work

364
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:40,758
on uh several different uh overwintering

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,759
cover crops including uh winter annual

366
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:49,800
leum species as well as um serial rye

367
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,240
and several Brasa species and we're

368
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,559
breeding for a number of different

369
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,120
traits primarily related to Farmer

370
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:01,078
adoption

371
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,519
um uh so things like early Vigor ability

372
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,279
to survive the winter and cold climates

373
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,199
and ability to produce a lot of biomass

374
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,879
which is um correlated with a lot of the

375
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,798
um ecosystem service benefits that

376
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,160
farmers are

377
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,318
seeking we also um have lead the winter

378
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,959
pea breeding program within our larger

379
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:23,318
Network um and and one of the traits

380
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,279
that we're specifically interested in

381
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,960
Winter PE is is overwintering ability

382
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,038
it's um not consistently overwintering

383
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,200
in in Northern locations in the US and

384
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,400
Canada and we've recently acquired a

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,480
cold temperature growth chamber uh uh

386
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,559
that will allow us to do more rapid

387
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,558
evaluation of our pjm plasm and select

388
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,038
uh populations that that are better

389
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,960
adapted to uh survive the winter in New

390
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,599
York and and in other locations across

391
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,840
the country um and so we're screening

392
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,319
for for cold tolerance um in a wide

393
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:00,678
range of p accessions and this work is

394
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:04,359
largely led by uh my PhD student rxa

395
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,919
thaa um who uh yeah has really um

396
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,959
pioneered development of these protocols

397
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,600
in our

398
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,319
lab and um the the third uh principle

399
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,839
that we work on maximizing biodiversity

400
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:20,200
um we think about this largely through

401
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,079
um breeding for for multicrop systems

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,000
things like intercropping breeding for

403
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:30,519
uh mixtures of different species uh to

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,759
grow to grow well together um

405
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:37,038
and uh one system that we work on is

406
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,440
breeding Alfalfa for intercropping with

407
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,919
intermediate wheat grass which is a

408
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,759
perennial grain crop um and so so we're

409
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,799
looking to develop Alfalfa that can be a

410
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,879
suitable companion for for intermediate

411
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:54,119
weat grass and and for use in um Dual

412
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,200
Purpose systems producing both perennial

413
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,678
grain and uh forage

414
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,880
biomass and

415
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,960
um so that's an example of of row

416
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,559
intercropping that we're pursuing in the

417
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,919
lab and then we also have a project

418
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:13,678
focused on on um breeding red clover for

419
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,200
intercropping with corn um and that's an

420
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,400
example of relay intercropping so we

421
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,159
plant the corn first so there's a period

422
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
where it's a single crop system and then

423
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,400
we intercede red clover and it has to

424
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,840
survive under the corn canopy for

425
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,038
several months uh before the corn is

426
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,918
harvested and then the red clover can

427
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:36,679
can um continue growing and provide

428
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,880
cover cropping and forage benefits for

429
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,480
Farmers um and then the final principle

430
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,240
I wanted to discuss is minimizing

431
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:49,120
disturbance so um this is we approach

432
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,079
this by um evaluating variety

433
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,678
performance in reduced tillage systems

434
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,038
so as some of you might be familiar with

435
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,720
um in in organic uh cropping system

436
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:05,240
Farmers tend to rely on on tillage as a

437
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,759
a tool to manage weeds uh rather than

438
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,759
using herbicides and this has a real um

439
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,960
significant trade-off in terms of soil

440
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,720
health and so there's interest in

441
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,279
developing reduced tillage organic weed

442
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,600
Management systems for example using

443
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,158
cover crops as a mulch to suppress weed

444
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,359
growth um so this is an example of one

445
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,640
of our technicians Jesse Chavez uh

446
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,079
roller crimping Ry cover crop um or a

447
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,960
rye it looks like Rye um hay vetch cover

448
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:38,759
crop uh that will then plant a cash crop

449
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,440
into directly and so we've we've done

450
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:45,240
some variety trials uh with a couple of

451
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,159
different um main crop species with hemp

452
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,558
and with dry beans to evaluate variety

453
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,320
adaptation to these um reduced tillage

454
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,678
uh cover crop-based

455
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,759
systems uh and and this can be a kind of

456
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,919
challenging environment for for cash

457
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,640
crops they need to emerge germinate in

458
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,720
Cold Soil and emerge through this thick

459
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,520
uh layer of biomass that's um that that

460
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,798
the mulch um comprises and then um

461
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,400
depending on the cover crop that you're

462
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:15,119
using you might also have significant

463
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,759
nitrogen tie up so so it can be a

464
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,759
challenging environment so we're

465
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:22,519
evaluating um variation in in different

466
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,919
uh crop varieties to to perform in these

467
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,679
systems and I've also done some

468
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,640
comparisons of of different um dry bean

469
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,000
cultivars between tilled and no till

470
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,038
systems and this is work that's been led

471
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,960
by Master student Erica Everest in my

472
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,400
lab um and it's also part of a a larger

473
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,200
uh dry be organic dry bean project uh

474
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,480
that some other folks in in sits are

475
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,759
involved with and I will leave it there

476
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,679
thanks

477
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:53,839
John maybe one question yeah so would

478
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,360
the

479
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,240
compound do you guys have any idea you

480
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,839
said you have the exra do you have any

481
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,319
idea is in that extract and like you

482
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,519
proba that back to a bean or some sort

483
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,519
of um other system where they've looked

484
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,359
at um knocking these out or making

485
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,839
resistant plants sure sure we don't we

486
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,079
we're still learning what the compounds

487
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,240
are it's not been um identified there

488
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,839
are multiple compounds that are um

489
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:24,359
producing are yeah that are um producing

490
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:26,319
this effect and and there is uh yeah

491
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,558
variation in both production and

492
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,960
susceptibility in our Alpha cultiv ours

493
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,960
we are working with some folks at at

494
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Michigan State to identify compounds and

495
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,840
also look at at interactions with soil

496
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,000
microbiome and yeah there's a it's a

497
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,319
super complex system that we're still

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,558
definitely unraveling yeah great

499
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:47,879
question uh I'm I'm mostly gonna talk a

500
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,079
little bit about uh our our flower bulb

501
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,760
program that that we had done for 25

502
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:56,399
years here I I'm mostly a greenhouse

503
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:58,960
crops person not uh vegetables not

504
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,798
edible food but ornamental

505
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,919
uh when we talk about uh Greenhouse

506
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,480
crops and and we've done a lot of work

507
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,038
with flower bulbs and and carbohydrates

508
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,519
uh you know bulbs are big bags of

509
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,400
carbohydrates so we were quite

510
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,319
interested in in learning more about

511
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,759
that over the last you know long time um

512
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:20,599
and then I also teach the the greenhouse

513
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,599
uh management course uh which which

514
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,959
we'll talk about that a little bit which

515
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,639
many of you participate in that helping

516
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,000
to to teach that okay all right so uh so

517
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,440
we we worked for 25 years with the Dutch

518
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,480
flower bulb export Association uh which

519
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:43,278
was sort of an interesting thing um uh

520
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,919
they had a program that they started in

521
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:49,278
1965 and it was it was sort of a

522
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,480
research SL extension program to

523
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:55,038
generate information that was useful for

524
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,440
Greenhouse producers in the US and

525
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:01,158
Canada and also landscape people nurs

526
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,558
iies anyone you know commercially who

527
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,080
was using flower bulbs and so for them

528
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:08,480
they would support uh This research and

529
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,759
and some Outreach and and presumably

530
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,519
that would help uh the industry with

531
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,960
their flower bulb problems and they

532
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,918
would buy more bulbs from the Dutch so

533
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,038
that was great um we I was the second

534
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,440
person to do that and I think the last

535
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,519
person uh the first person was was

536
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,480
Guster hertog he started at Michigan

537
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,639
State and then ended up at at North

538
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,960
Carolina State um they published a book

539
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,200
after 50 years uh which was really quite

540
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,319
nice um one of the nice things about

541
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,840
this we had a number of interns we had

542
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:44,079
18 Dutch interns uh the the the the

543
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,879
industry every year would send you know

544
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,199
practically hundreds of thousands of

545
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,320
bulbs uh for experiments that we did at

546
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,399
the greenhouse and in the landscape and

547
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,240
they would also send an intern to help

548
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,839
plant everything and collect the data

549
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,480
and it was really great uh we we had

550
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:03,119
these were these were young students uh

551
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,079
some of them were 21 most of them were

552
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,519
not uh the drinking age in Holland is

553
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,359
certainly less than 21 and They Carried

554
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,839
that on uh whenever they got here in the

555
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,678
US um we had open houses we had all

556
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,439
kinds of Industry visitors um I only

557
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,919
know of one arrest of these interns uh

558
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,960
that was really quite a funny story I'd

559
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,720
be happy to tell you about it but but

560
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,640
maybe not here on the camera uh while

561
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,600
things are being being recorded okay now

562
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,919
if if I do this this is great okay so

563
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,359
some of the things that we did uh really

564
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,200
the the work was based

565
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,959
on interesting problems in the

566
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,519
greenhouse industry okay is as far as

567
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,120
forcing of flower bulbs either as potted

568
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,158
plants or as cut flowers and so there

569
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,158
were all kinds of cultivar Trials of

570
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,600
tulips daffodils and hydrangeas and

571
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,080
lilies and all kinds of things um uh one

572
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,959
of the issues with with the production

573
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,558
of of greenhouse crops in pots is a

574
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,840
height control and you might say well

575
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,960
you you could always breed uh dwarfer

576
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,199
plants and of course you can but but

577
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,120
that's not always possible so it's quite

578
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,440
common to use anti- gibberellin growth

579
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:20,599
retardants uh in Greenhouse production

580
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,880
of ornamental plants and we did a lot of

581
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,398
research on that we did some interesting

582
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,120
work with ethon uh and and realize that

583
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,798
e ethon which is which is a liquid uh

584
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,678
it's called liquid ethylene two

585
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:37,679
chloroethyl phosphonic acid it releases

586
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,120
ethylene in plant tissue it's it at

587
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,038
least in our tulips and daffodils it

588
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,479
crosses uh into the root and it moves

589
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,599
freely upwards in the xylm which was

590
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,880
quite interesting so we developed

591
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:54,398
methods of of applying ethon as a soil

592
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,640
application which which is quite quite

593
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:00,278
unique um for growth Regulators we did a

594
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,278
lot of work work on a

595
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:07,119
ga47 uh which turns out as a very potent

596
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:09,440
inhibitor of leaf and Essence in lilies

597
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:12,398
uh either as cut flowers or potted

598
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,840
plants uh many of the Lily cultivars

599
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:20,199
have have pretty pretty

600
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:22,398
atrocious uh uh Leaf closis towards the

601
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,399
end of their production

602
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,719
cycle and uh the the work that we did

603
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:29,199
and this was really a Neil randalla when

604
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,240
when we first first moved here from

605
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,840
Clemson in 1998 an Neil did a lot of

606
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,038
great work and it eventually expanded

607
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:42,678
existing labels for uh ga47 to be used

608
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:46,798
on lies and so uh Easter lies that you

609
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,240
buy uh at Easter time if they have green

610
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,319
leaves on them you can be certain they

611
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,079
were treated with

612
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,759
ga47 if they have yellow leaves and they

613
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,918
look bad you can be certain that they

614
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,919
were not treated with ga47 so so

615
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,000
practically you know all of the lies

616
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,240
grown in North America are treated with

617
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,558
this um we we did we did work in these

618
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,399
Bud development meters um it becomes

619
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:15,158
interesting for in green houses when

620
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:18,398
you're growing crops for a holiday

621
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,919
period and you have to have that plant

622
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,199
flowering X number of days before the

623
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,399
holiday so that you can sell it and get

624
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,360
it into the stores in order for people

625
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,319
to buy it that is critical not on a

626
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,759
weekly cycle when you can have it go to

627
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,759
market at any time when you're growing

628
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,960
for holidays you've got like Easter lies

629
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,359
key example you have to have these

630
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
plants available at the right time and

631
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,959
so when you start looking at the

632
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
temperature the lighting all the

633
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,519
different things that you can do to make

634
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,119
the plant flower on time being able to

635
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,558
predict you know when when the plant's

636
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,239
going to flower is key and with lies um

637
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,720
well there's there's just gazillions of

638
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,000
cultivars and we spent a lot of time

639
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,399
working on that uh the trouble is the

640
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,599
Lily breeders breed more lies than we

641
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:09,199
really need and so there's a lot of work

642
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,519
there that well it's nice work but

643
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,558
bye-bye uh because those cultivars all

644
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,038
go away pretty quickly um I don't know

645
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:20,720
there's there there's some interesting

646
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,919
stuff about fusarium and ethylene um

647
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,519
fusarium produces ethylene and causes

648
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,000
very severe problems on tulips when

649
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:33,839
they're when especially when they're Shi

650
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,558
in containers on vessels from reram to

651
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:40,359
to uh to New

652
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:44,200
Jersey um interesting stuff about that

653
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:46,798
simple things uh planting depth you know

654
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,038
it some something as simple as literally

655
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,960
how deep you plant a be root perennial

656
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:56,240
is is either leading to success or

657
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,319
failure uh that there's a huge be root

658
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,200
perennial industry in the Netherlands

659
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,960
and and and if if these plants are

660
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,880
planted uh like like an inch or two

661
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,919
inches deep in a in a pot according to

662
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,559
what the directions are uh 80% of them

663
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,038
will not grow you know they they so they

664
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,200
they require a certain amount of light

665
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,038
certain stimulus to actually start

666
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,798
growing and and very very simple

667
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,960
experiments but um but quite useful

668
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,759
experiments okay so uh the the thing

669
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,120
that we've occupied ourselves for the

670
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,519
last last few years because we how do I

671
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:37,119
have do I have a cou couple minutes okay

672
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,440
we have we have this planter the Dutch

673
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,839
sent us this planter with a 100,000

674
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,600
bulbs and they said go plant some stuff

675
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:48,079
so it's a very interesting planter and

676
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:50,398
you would have seen if you go downtown

677
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,678
you would have seen the results of this

678
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:56,000
the BIOS Swale and the Botanical Garden

679
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,440
here's the mclin talk shed this is down

680
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,839
right right near uh

681
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,278
uh Boatyard Grill C Park we've planted

682
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,720
about a half million daffodils downtown

683
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:10,319
in the last five years that I think have

684
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,159
been very nicely received we've done

685
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,558
research to

686
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,278
support if if you're planting bulbs uh

687
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:21,359
in the grass which is what this machine

688
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,319
does it lifts the saw drops the bulbs

689
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,119
under the saw and then replaces the

690
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:29,759
bulbs or replaces the saw as the tractor

691
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:33,798
drives along um um the question then

692
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:36,599
becomes when can you mow the grass when

693
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:39,079
can you mow the bulbs because we need to

694
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,759
have foliage in order to build the bulb

695
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,720
back up so there's a there's a conflict

696
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,720
and we we've done work to figure that

697
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,798
out it's h it's about June

698
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:55,200
10th uh downtown or or down on Long

699
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:57,879
Island uh 75,000 bulbs three hours three

700
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,759
people with this machine so the comp

701
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,840
ianes have have have brought in about 15

702
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,319
of these machines in the last three

703
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,278
years um and and they've been pretty

704
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,879
widely adapted throughout the Northeast

705
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,880
and down into the South so so we've

706
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,320
helped with that and I see you're about

707
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,480
ready to stand up so I'm gonna stop

708
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,558
okay thank

709
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,000
you yeah I just

710
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:28,879
wondering are there any like elusive

711
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,440
traits that that you or other have gone

712
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,919
after um for

713
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,600
buls any what kind of

714
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:43,399
traits desirable but impossible to

715
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:45,240
achieve a black tulip it doesn't exist

716
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:48,798
there there are very dark dark dark

717
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,278
purple tulips but no black tulips um one

718
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,879
of the one of the cool things if you

719
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,638
ever get a chance to go to Holland

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,039
there's a great in the

721
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:59,839
springtime uh there's a garden up above

722
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,319
alicar near alicore called the htis B

723
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,638
Borum and it is a it's a living

724
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,158
collection of ancient tulip

725
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,719
cultivars

726
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,159
including intentionally virus infected

727
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,519
plants right the the whole you know

728
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,360
tulip Mania and all of that and there

729
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,960
are there are cultivars or there's tulip

730
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:24,678
germ plasm that that coexists pretty

731
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,079
happily with the virus usually tulip

732
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,440
breaking virus is fatal after after a

733
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:32,960
few years but some some genetic

734
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,639
backgrounds tolerate that widely and and

735
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,159
there and they they will have 3,000 you

736
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:42,158
know of these infected tulips all the

737
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:46,120
same kind of color and pattern it's it's

738
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:50,320
astounding it's astounding

739
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,319
so okay Bill okay yeah
