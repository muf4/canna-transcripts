1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,519
University Bill thanks a lot for the

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,760
introduction uh I remember interviewing

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,000
for my position back in 1981 and I was

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,560
in this room now it's been remodled a

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,759
few times since then but uh this takes

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,038
me way back and I'm not going to try to

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
give a history of what I've done you

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,519
know I was thinking of a title like 43

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,719
years and 43 minut but I said no so I

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,238
thought maybe some of the more recent

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,879
projects and trying to what we're

13
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:42,558
calling Under the topic of modern seed

14
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:44,399
technology uh there's many many people

15
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,679
as all of us go through Cornell

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,879
especially for such a long period that

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,119
you run across and how they've affected

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,839
you that they're Cooperators there have

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,640
been grad students in your program

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,719
visiting scientists a number of people

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,759
way way too many to to list here but I I

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,159
want to mention just

23
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,200
one was Dr Carl Leopold who was at the

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,759
Boyce Thompson Institute is probably one

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,920
of our most famous seed biologist the

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:15,799
past several years ago uh he was I would

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,799
say this you know good teachers teach

28
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,640
Next Level motivate he was actually

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,680
pretty inspirational in some of the

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,840
things that he was doing and it kind of

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,040
rubbed off in some of the early work

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,840
that we did in more the applied area

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,600
relations in water relations of seeds

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
uh Carl was also Thomas bjorkman's PhD

35
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,679
advisor so that kind of connects him a

36
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,199
little bit with some of the things so I

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,000
just want to start with that I said

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,439
there's just so so many people but give

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,319
you

40
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:51,879
that okay so obviously my life is

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,959
seeds and this is what you're going to

42
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,478
be hearing but hopefully there may be

43
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,519
some of the little nuggets that uh some

44
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,280
little ahas I had thought about that

45
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,399
maybe that would work in sep things that

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,439
you're doing in in your own program so

47
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,280
first of all we're going to start off

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,239
what is the kind of looking at the I'll

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,439
call it the agronomic life cycle of

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,878
seeds from production of seeds all the

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,598
way through to crop

52
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,560
production now here and focusing on

53
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,479
vegetable crops most of the seed

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,280
production harvesting this is we are not

55
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,399
here in the Northeast in an area where

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,840
there is that much seed production most

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,640
of that would be in the western part of

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,519
the United States where the climates

59
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,679
much better or much of it now is is more

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,039
of a global business in different

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,800
countries based on environmental

62
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,560
parameters that are in that which are

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,360
optimal for those particular crops

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
conditioning is really kind of the

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,400
physical sizing of the seed grading

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
seeds try to improve the seed quality

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,319
this is all when they're in the dry

68
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,119
condition after the Harvest storage of

69
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,238
the seed preser really the key there is

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,480
Preservation of the seed quality the

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,878
germination the Vigor of the seed lant

72
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,878
this is what we're trying to preserve

73
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,318
until the time of sewing now we come

74
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,280
into the area that we're going to be

75
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,199
talking about is Under the Umbrella of

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,719
seed enhancements and there's different

77
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,158
examples of that I'm going to go through

78
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,598
a few examples of some of our work in

79
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,359
seed treatments and Seed Coatings but

80
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,479
those of you familiar may have worked

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,760
with seed priming techniques priming

82
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,280
would also be listed as one of these

83
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,840
type of enhancements we're not going to

84
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,479
be talking about that though this

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,000
morning or this

86
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,560
afternoon seed quality assurance with

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
germination seed quality testing is is

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,120
really important to make sure that the

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,560
grower has high quality seeds and has

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,560
some parameter by looking at the label

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,519
of the seeds so they know what that that

92
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,479
quality is now we move into more of what

93
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,879
is happening in the north east and this

94
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,840
part is the planting of seeds in the

95
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,318
crop production and most faculty

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
programs are

97
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,039
focus on that area but just realize that

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
there's there's many steps to this

99
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759
agronomic life cycle what I've done is

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,879
since we're not in a seed producing area

101
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,078
is really try to Target my research

102
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:18,639
program in this post Harvest area of

103
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,358
working with seeds what can we do to

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,720
treat them to enhance uh their

105
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,719
performance

106
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,759
potential this is kind of breakdown

107
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,840
there's a lot of subtopics under the sea

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,280
treatments and codings we'll talk about

109
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,439
kind of the the the cookbook part of the

110
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,679
composition the processes that are

111
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,719
involved and then go through a few case

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,439
studies uh using organic seed treatment

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,479
insecticides on onion onion being

114
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,240
obviously major crop here in in in New

115
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,519
York State uh with the work with hemp

116
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,478
that we've done uh and development of

117
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,319
organic seed treatment fungicides some

118
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,399
of the experimental materials that we

119
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,959
tested at the time we'll go through that

120
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,159
kind of quickly then we'll kind of break

121
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,879
away from the seed treatments and try to

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,479
better understand the biology the

123
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,478
science part and the seed coat

124
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:10,399
permeability and that then Segways into

125
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,478
a more recent work and using some of the

126
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,120
systemic seed treatments this is not now

127
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,680
for plant uh protection per se but

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
actually visualization of where the

129
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,038
seedlings are and that'll become obvious

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,560
as we go through them the last one is is

131
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,439
kind of where our last topic kind of my

132
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,079
what I consider kind of my last topic

133
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,319
working with with different faculty and

134
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,198
crop and soil science with Tony D Tomaso

135
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,800
John Losi and entomology on this mscp

136
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,720
multiple seed Zia pellet and here we're

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,560
looking at to enhance the biodiversity

138
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,560
with establishing various pollinator

139
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
plants

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,720
so member of a of a multi-state project

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,960
when I think it's it's been very good

142
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,240
that there are a group of us seed

143
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,599
scientists uh that that work together

144
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,600
collaborate together at least exchange

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,919
knowledge together and so there is a

146
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,919
review of this seed enhancements you can

147
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,279
see it's kind of dated 1998 that I was

148
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,758
the senior author that so I came up with

149
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,478
this definition that we're looking at

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
post Harvest methods that improve the

151
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,879
germination or seedling

152
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,318
growth or facilitate the delivery of

153
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,759
seeds and then finally application of

154
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,960
other materials required at time of

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
sewing the examples that I'm going to be

156
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,038
talking about really fall into number

157
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,959
two and three if you're doing the seed

158
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,759
priming or we've done work on bio

159
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,560
stimulants that would kind of fall into

160
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,960
the number one so so he seed

161
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,160
enhancements is not just a method per se

162
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,799
it's really kind of an umbrella

163
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,919
terminology for a number of Technologies

164
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,840
under that

165
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,279
umbrella we're going to talk about the

166
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,439
different seed Coatings we'll use onions

167
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,719
here as an example uh onions are small

168
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,399
seeds irregular shape we you see about

169
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,080
3.5 millimeters the size of the raw

170
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,560
onion seeds in the upper right hand

171
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,199
corner and then there's different

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
coating technology

173
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,000
the blue are film coating the film

174
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,759
coating is originally adapted from the

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,120
pharmaceutical in The Confectionary area

176
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,199
of the colorants and the plasticizers

177
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,478
the materials that are used uh in those

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,319
areas are then been adopted for

179
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:21,120
application of seed treatments pelleted

180
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,879
seeds that is used on onions still used

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
commercially there with so much filler

182
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,479
material that this kind of changes the

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,720
whole ballistics and improves the plab

184
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,758
ility for the singulation of those seeds

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,560
the encrusting is somewhat of a hybrid

186
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,080
between the two of the film coding and

187
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,160
the encrusting where there's certain

188
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,719
amount of materials that are use part of

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,039
the buildup of

190
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,720
those all right

191
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:50,120
so M who H from my laboratory uh we have

192
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,560
a a review article came out a few years

193
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,720
ago trying to take a a broad view of the

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,680
whole seed treatments and the first is

195
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,560
is kind of is is kind of the cookbook

196
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,598
part of all the different potential

197
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639
ingredients that can go into a seed

198
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,279
treatment and coating on the left hand

199
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
side are the different Active Components

200
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,598
so what are you trying to apply our

201
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,679
examples today are mostly focused around

202
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:14,719
the plant protectants insecticides

203
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,079
fungicides and that's where the largest

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,080
part of the the market share

205
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:29,758
is I'm seeing El Taylor but not the

206
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:32,679
slides I'm not sure how to remedy that

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:37,200
uh okay um

208
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,918
anyway getting back to the Active

209
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,479
Components there are the bio stimulants

210
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,199
like I said there's different materials

211
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,278
that are used and then we can see the

212
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,240
smaller the S YN means it's synthetic

213
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,759
material can be organic the O

214
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
parentheses so it kind of just

215
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,519
classifies

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,159
materials the next part is what do you

217
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,480
need to put on with the materials are

218
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,159
the liquids and water is the key water

219
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,440
we're not using any organic solvents I

220
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,639
did this project uh started with boy

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
Thompson many years ago and they said

222
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,559
we're going to put DMSO on tomato seeds

223
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,559
and I said don't do that so when you

224
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,159
look commercially water is the universal

225
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,599
carrier water is the universal solvent

226
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,000
when it comes to applying materials and

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,639
there's different binders which are the

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,278
adhesives hopefully Bruce is seeing this

229
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,639
now

230
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,200
I will text BL

231
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,360
okay so there's a different constituents

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,959
so we need the adhes adhesives which are

233
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,360
the binder materials which hold

234
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,439
materials onto the seed and then the

235
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,360
last column the solid particulates those

236
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,839
can be these binders so in the case of a

237
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,039
solid particulate binder with a filler

238
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
you're only applying powers and then you

239
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,599
only have to spray water so so a lot of

240
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,399
the streamlining has incurred most of

241
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,519
the fillers are just materials that have

242
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
been mined such as the Limestone gyps

243
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,560
and the only only thing that's been done

244
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,440
to those is just Milling those to

245
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,239
problem solve says Bruce rice yay okay

246
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,279
I'm glad everybody out there can see the

247
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
slides at this point so anyway this is

248
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,159
kind of like going into a kitchen and

249
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,679
then having all the ingredients there

250
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,039
but you need to decide what you want to

251
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,159
apply what is the purpose for that what

252
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,958
type of coding technology and we'll talk

253
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,838
about that

254
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,000
next if for example just just because

255
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,639
many people are interested in organic

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,240
production you need to use an

257
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,919
organically approved seed treatment to

258
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,079
do this but along with that organically

259
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,719
approved seed treatment such as a

260
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,479
biological you also need to use the

261
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,040
liquid components and the solid

262
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,278
particulates also have to be

263
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,278
organically approved so you have to

264
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,559
consider the whole system everything

265
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,480
that's going onto that seed must be

266
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,879
organically approved

267
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,079
uh again from that same review article

268
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,559
methodology we have a dry powder

269
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,479
application this would be an unarm

270
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,159
operation where the seeds would be

271
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
treated right prior to sewing and

272
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,159
probably the most common is say using

273
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,078
some of the inoculant materials rium

274
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,399
which are tend to be short-lived those

275
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,120
could be treated uh right on and right

276
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,720
prior to the sewing operation the rotary

277
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,839
coder which is probably one of the kind

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,040
of the key workhorses where the liquid

279
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,440
material is being atomized onto an

280
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,919
atomization disc and then is treating

281
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
the seeds and then you can adjust by

282
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,399
those fillers how much of the buildup so

283
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,600
you can see the seed dressing it's kind

284
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,039
of a European term the seed dressing

285
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,399
which is just what we would call a seed

286
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,559
treatment but it gets a little confusing

287
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,679
on on the process wise so it' be seed

288
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,759
dressing the film coating like I showed

289
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,838
you the encrust m so we're seeing more

290
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:59,679
and more of the buildup of the material

291
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,600
so finally the the seed pting operation

292
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,039
okay mentioned this dry powder so at

293
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Geneva Kyle wickings is our turf

294
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,199
entomologist and he has a project where

295
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,958
they have certain biological seed

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,720
treatments and the

297
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,599
Biologicals uh cannot withstand kind of

298
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,720
a wedding and drying so they really are

299
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,839
very sensitive to these hydration

300
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,000
dehydration events and then I said

301
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,480
earlier that we have to use

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,639
water in our seed treatment and Seed

303
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,680
coating process so if we can't use water

304
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,879
then we go take a step back and use this

305
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,239
seed powder technique so everything your

306
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,159
biological is already as a dry powdered

307
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,919
formulation we're mixing this in this

308
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,319
case with a t graphite mixture and

309
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,799
that's being applied we're we're okay

310
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,760
now oh did they email back yeah I just

311
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,799
Bruce just sent a chck text we're okay

312
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,838
now uh so the upper pictures we're

313
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,759
looking at some field crops we use we

314
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,639
generally use a large seated crop as

315
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,480
kind of as a model system and then you

316
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,680
can see the tall fescue and the Kentucky

317
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,440
Blue there so that's an autof

318
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,638
fluoresence that bluish green color of

319
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,680
the seeds under just a black light long

320
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,839
long 365 nanometer long

321
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:20,799
wavelength then with our Coatings we are

322
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,440
applying a fluorescent Tracer material

323
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,838
that's where you see that bright red

324
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,720
we're doing this one is it's pretty to

325
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,399
see these but we really want to make

326
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,800
sure that we have uniformity application

327
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,078
over the seed surface and uniformity

328
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,879
from seed to seed so this gives us a

329
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:40,719
visual assessment for that delivery

330
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,159
system of just applying a dry powder

331
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,519
powder that adheres onto the seed

332
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,319
surface this is kind of the Workhorse in

333
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,639
our laboratory it's a small laboratory

334
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:57,278
scale we call it R6 which is means for a

335
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:59,120
6 inch diameter or 15 cm uh coating pan

336
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,360
this slide there on the right the

337
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
picture on the right shows an

338
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,759
atomization disc which goes down into

339
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,159
the unit so the liquids are applied

340
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,199
atomized into very small droplets and

341
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,879
the seeds are being treated and then

342
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,958
you're you're done so it's a rather

343
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,078
rapid process we have a even little

344
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,359
YouTube it hasn't gone viral yet but you

345
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:20,799
can actually see the process of actually

346
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,240
coating uh seeds and delivery

347
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,599
that um I was again with this

348
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,399
multi-state group out at Oregon State

349
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,040
and then we did a little field trip so

350
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:34,919
this company I

351
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:38,078
iny Oregon is in the wamit valley so

352
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,958
very large seed production and so that

353
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,439
little rotary pan that we have the

354
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,599
principles involved of a rotary is

355
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,079
scaled up in here so you going from 50

356
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,240
grams of seeds to hundreds and hundreds

357
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,919
of pounds of seeds so the technology is

358
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,959
nice is what we can do at the laboratory

359
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,399
scale is directly amendable to the

360
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,518
scaleup so it's not a toal total

361
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,600
separate consideration as part of the of

362
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,399
the research okay I'm going to digress

363
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,079
here a little bit U so we have these

364
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,159
pelleted seeds and this is a lettuce

365
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,879
seed which is inside of an

366
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,000
pellet take a res and cut through that

367
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,320
so now the question is is we know for

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,198
seed storage that the moisture content

369
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,680
of the seed is very important now how do

370
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,359
you measure the moisture content how do

371
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,638
you access that seed how do you

372
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,440
understand what that moisture is which

373
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,639
is important for the storage so the

374
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,519
figure with the broccoli and the snap

375
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,000
Bean is showing what we call a moisture

376
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:44,639
isotherm moisture isotherm is how water

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,679
is held onto the seeds and you can see

378
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,639
differences the broccoli which I say is

379
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,599
similar to soybean that would be an oil

380
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,639
or lipid storing seed the snap Bean is a

381
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,040
starch storing seed so you can see the

382
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,919
curves are roughly the same shape just

383
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,759
shifted because of the oil content

384
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,519
uh I just want to plug this too that

385
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,480
that this is published um Chris W's

386
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,639
second book and is a vegetable crop

387
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,959
physiology he also had the first edition

388
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,639
and I also had the first chapter in that

389
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,318
so very very proud that Lung Association

390
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,399
that I've had with Chris but that's

391
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:21,879
where this uh Mo moisture isotherm shows

392
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,559
which is really kind of our

393
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,639
understanding of water relations and

394
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,239
seeds in storage and under the dry

395
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,720
conditions

396
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,440
okay with that

397
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,120
background now you can kind of

398
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,120
extrapolate the line there of if you

399
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,039
hold seeds of 50% relative humidity that

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,720
will give us a corresponding moisture

401
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,919
content and we have laboratory

402
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,839
instrumentation uh at Geneva to actually

403
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,519
measure what we call water activity

404
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,720
which is the decimal equivalent of the

405
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,919
relative humidity so and I give this

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,199
talk to a lot of different organizations

407
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,639
different companies say well we don't

408
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,359
have a water activity instrument so I

409
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,600
tried to to try to make this more

410
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,160
simplified as well so this is just a

411
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,400
handheld relative humidity meter put

412
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,679
that inside of the Ziploc baggie or any

413
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,160
some sort of enclosed container so by

414
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,199
measuring that relative humidity you

415
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,959
then have the essence of what the water

416
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,679
activity is of the sample also we use

417
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,160
this uh nut is is clean cut because of

418
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,360
the gradations there but taking a small

419
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,600
piece of this paper putting it in with

420
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,279
the Ziploc baggie it'll just change

421
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,558
colors and so you again have an idea

422
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:36,038
especially if if the moisture of the

423
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,798
seeds is too high let's say say 60% or

424
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,200
higher than you'd have a quick diagnosis

425
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,480
of what the the water activity is or

426
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,319
equilibrium relative

427
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,720
humidity all right now we're going to

428
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,399
get back to our seed treatment

429
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,960
theme kind of two major groups are the

430
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
chemical seed treatments then the

431
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,960
biological seed treatments on the

432
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,079
chemicals which is the the probably

433
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
two-thirds of the market share is in

434
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,000
those areas uh insecticides and

435
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,000
fungicides and so we'll have some

436
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,880
examples of of the type of work that

437
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,960
I've done in collaboration with

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,760
entomologist and

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,880
pathologist mostly mostly at G Geneva

440
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,879
but also outside of the agretech

441
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,600
so I tell the onion story in very

442
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,480
quickly so when I came on the scene in

443
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,399
the 80s this is what Planting onions

444
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,519
look

445
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,280
like onion seeds for Dre seed onions to

446
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,679
produce bulbing onions planted early in

447
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,798
the season in April don't Harvest until

448
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,159
the end of the year the onions are grown

449
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,599
on organic soils we call Muk soils so

450
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,760
you can see in the tractor in the front

451
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:48,079
there's a large tank and so that's where

452
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,759
there's big volume gallonage with the

453
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,519
insecticide fungicides these some of

454
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,158
these insecticides were pretty nasty

455
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,480
materials in fact they've been banned in

456
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,960
the last few years we are seeing the use

457
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,038
of farmers are using pelleted seeds for

458
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,640
singulation with a planter type called a

459
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,759
belt seeder you can see those the Stan

460
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,919
hay type of a planter so you could have

461
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,000
the Precision placement so there's some

462
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,080
parts of the technology that we could

463
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,200
kind of build on through our

464
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,720
research so what I kind of prophesized

465
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,200
uh back when I was younger and I still

466
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,319
had red hair is I said you know we're

467
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,679
going to get away from all these tanks

468
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,079
we're going to get away from all this

469
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,159
hauling these pesticides over the land

470
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,720
have to go back and refill again

471
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,480
everything's going to go on the seed the

472
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,038
seed treatment is going to go right on

473
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,759
with the coating so that was kind of

474
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,960
what my prophecy was I I got a little

475
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,759
bit of push back by some of the

476
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,200
Pathologists but that was you know we're

477
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,200
going back to a previous light if on on

478
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,798
that so let's just stick with with what

479
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,720
we did to to to achieve that goal first

480
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,319
of all you needed a seed coating

481
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,919
technology you needed a delivery system

482
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,839
of getting these seed treatments on the

483
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,200
seeds and especially looking at pretty

484
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,279
high loading rates we couldn't use the

485
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,960
little seed dressing Technique we needed

486
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,079
so that's where the pellet came in where

487
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,240
part of the pellet during the formation

488
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,558
of that pellet there could be a band

489
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,640
called pellet loading of the materials

490
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,319
and this is done by the the seed

491
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,000
treatment industry the seed pellin

492
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,119
industry much of it out in the west

493
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,759
coast the second part is you need some

494
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,359
different materials new chemistry

495
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,839
materials that are one going to be very

496
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,959
effective have downside very minimal

497
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:37,079
phytotoxicity but also which is very

498
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,480
challenging with specialty crops low

499
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:43,558
acreage high value crops is the

500
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,558
registrant must support that

501
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,558
label so I mentioned about these

502
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,038
different pellings uh when I started

503
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,319
this project with just comparing

504
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:55,359
different pellets there was probably

505
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,240
about 10 15 different companies now we

506
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,038
we have five companies that do pting now

507
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
they don't just do vegetables they'll

508
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:04,440
they'll do flower seeds and things so so

509
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,079
they're not restricted to vegetables but

510
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,840
that's probably their their

511
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:12,119
largest part of their their business but

512
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,558
the pting technology is well worked out

513
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,678
within these

514
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,319
industries and I just want to call

515
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,320
attention the type of pellets we have we

516
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,119
call a hybrid and then a split coat so

517
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,359
let's look at the the picture and the

518
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,879
lower left hand corner the tan ones are

519
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,719
what we have a split coat so in other

520
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,919
words the p are planted they're in a

521
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,200
moist substrate and there's like a

522
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,840
cleavage that the seed actually the

523
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,880
pallet opens up that allows oxygen to

524
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,558
get to the germinating seed and there's

525
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
no restriction for the germination the

526
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,519
hybrid is a hybrid between the split

527
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
coat and what we call a melt coat in

528
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,319
other words it kind of dissolves away

529
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,839
and so that you're seeing cleavage in

530
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,678
different areas it achieves the same and

531
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:56,720
as far as Pest Management with putting

532
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,679
seed treatments they're both effective

533
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,480
as Delivery Systems for the insecticides

534
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,559
fungicides this is what some of the

535
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,720
newer Planters look like moving away

536
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,200
from the old Bell Planters to vacuum

537
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,600
seeders and so now you can plant the

538
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,679
palleted seed but you can also go to the

539
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,678
encrusted seed the yellow ones and the

540
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,559
upper right hand corner the advantage

541
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,480
there is there's a lot less physical

542
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,200
material the shipping costs are reduced

543
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,079
the production costs by the seed

544
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,919
companies that are making these is also

545
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,038
reduced so it's become a little bit more

546
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,640
economical to go that way

547
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,240
again combining that with the vacuum

548
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,240
Cedar

549
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,319
technology I'm going to bring in now

550
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,880
getting to the chemistry materials and

551
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,319
as a challenge which is a very large

552
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,278
overarching problem is the use of

553
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,519
neonicotinoids and neonicotinoid Seed

554
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:53,480
treatments there are three seed

555
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,240
treatments we have just showing you the

556
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,798
chemical name the moper the trade name

557
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,919
GAO and then the company that is selling

558
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:05,558
those so some of these are also used in

559
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,400
the onions they're used widely and other

560
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:09,200
mostly in field crops as a seed

561
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,880
treatment

562
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,080
insecticide environmental concerns with

563
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,799
colony collapse disorder some of the

564
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,359
dust off problems from those seeds that

565
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,918
have been treated with these new

566
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:26,278
nicotinoids in New York state we are

567
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,200
going to have a ban of the neonicotinoid

568
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:33,200
seed treatments on field crops in

569
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,840
2029 so the our IPM group and others are

570
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,919
working how we going to see some

571
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,720
substitutes how we dealing with this

572
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,480
challenge with the loss of these kind of

573
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,919
this major class of seed treatment

574
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,278
incde at Geneva we've kind of handled

575
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,520
this in the vegetables where we were

576
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,640
aware of this well before there was any

577
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,240
bans or restrictions just because of the

578
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,159
environmental concerns so we really need

579
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,240
alternate chemistries for this efficient

580
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,600
early season pest manag

581
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,319
management um this some early work when

582
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,240
Brian N is a vegetable entomologist and

583
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,558
he and I worked collaborated really

584
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,759
since he first started at Geneva as

585
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,599
assistant professor now full professor

586
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,599
and department chair whatever they call

587
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,519
them now at Geneva

588
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:22,519
administrators so the material that we

589
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,480
latched on to is called spinoid now if

590
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:27,558
you're familiar with Pest Management and

591
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,319
foler material spinoid is used as a

592
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:32,359
foler

593
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:35,678
insecticide it is the entrust

594
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,759
formulation is organically approved so

595
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,640
with that organic approval we said aha

596
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,398
that that is very good to have something

597
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,440
that's already omry approved but now is

598
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:49,239
it going to work so we did the work way

599
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,360
back at the time and it is quite

600
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,640
effective as far as controlling onion

601
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,678
maggots applied as a seed

602
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,759
treatment so if you want to try to put

603
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,480
this more on yeah a time frame because

604
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,839
working on specialty crops working on

605
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,480
pesticides it's a long time of work to

606
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,199
get something to see the light of day so

607
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,880
again going back to the time I started

608
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,840
we did have one SE treatment fungicide

609
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,480
this carboxin thym which also had some

610
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,839
phytotoxicity uh the first insecticide

611
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,759
was Brian n's predecessor his name is

612
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,158
Chuck eckenroad and so in the mid 90s we

613
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:34,440
had that cyromazine uh which is as an

614
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,360
insecticide still used to this day then

615
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,200
we see the spinoid and some of the other

616
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:42,798
the farm more packaging that senta had

617
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,558
done um at the time one I didn't talk

618
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,319
about is is a more recent uh seed

619
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,319
treatment fungicide for onion smut

620
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,240
called pen fluin but you can see a lot

621
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:57,000
of years a lot of time is involved and

622
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,558
again is having making sure that that

623
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,159
you have the registr the company that's

624
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,038
going to stand behind that especially

625
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,600
when they're going to label that for

626
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,839
commercial use and Brian nton and I had

627
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,719
several really good materials looked

628
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,639
really great excellent at Pest

629
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,839
Management but the compan for one reason

630
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,278
or another said no we're not going to

631
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,278
pursue that

632
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:24,278
so it died right there so where is that

633
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,000
now we're still working on this we're

634
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,599
working with companies that are doing

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,558
the pelting Brian is uh leading that

636
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:34,798
Leo's a PhD student in his laboratory

637
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,839
and then we have a number of faculty in

638
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,519
different areas maruth McDonald's up at

639
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,918
GF in Ontario she's doing trials with

640
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,119
some of the pellets that are being

641
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,960
produced Tim Waters in Washington

642
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,319
Stewart in Oregon uh California so so

643
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,919
we're so we're now kind of broadened out

644
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,278
with some of the the field testing in

645
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,000
cooperation with field entomologist

646
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,440
Christy hoping is with CCE she's out in

647
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,839
the bavia area uh where we're working

648
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,000
with her on some of the seed treatment

649
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,480
fungicides as well so there's kind of a

650
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
continuation it's not just our work and

651
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,519
done there is a continuation that I want

652
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:14,640
to talk about in several of these topic

653
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:17,240
areas uh next Case Case Study is going

654
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,240
to be with

655
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
hemp when Larry smart first kind of

656
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,679
formed the Cornell team we were

657
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,399
fortunate to be a part of part of that

658
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,798
team and dealing with some of the seed

659
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,000
science and techn techology issues the

660
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,000
first one he says well we're going to

661
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,519
treat the seeds and some of our standard

662
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,359
coating materials we are

663
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,639
using you can see there's Green in that

664
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,839
middle seeds but it's very

665
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,679
splotchy uh some were well treated some

666
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:50,158
w't treated at all so we I said we

667
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,798
really need a much better film coating

668
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,320
polymer to give us uniformity of

669
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,398
application so I have good contacts with

670
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,398
the with the seed industry with uh

671
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:02,319
companies this happen to be in

672
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,359
I said we have this new seed it has kind

673
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:08,038
of a waxy seed covering to it is there

674
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,479
any film forming materials that you have

675
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,200
that might work and they knew nothing

676
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,960
about hemp at the time and so they said

677
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,200
we've developed this that we've used

678
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,720
this on sorghum as another waxy seed we

679
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,278
have good relations they provide they

680
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
didn't tell me all the leev herbs and

681
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,960
spices that are in it but they provided

682
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,399
my

683
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,399
laboratory with this material and I've

684
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,000
had these long-term relationships with

685
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:31,959
these seed andan M companies that

686
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,038
they're willing to collaborate with us

687
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,759
maybe not give us all the Le herbs and

688
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,960
spices but very fortunate that we don't

689
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:40,640
have to do every inch of the way on the

690
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
development because we'd never be able

691
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,038
to do the things accomplish what we need

692
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,960
to if we had to do

693
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,319
that so now we're looking for control of

694
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,079
damping off much of that caused by

695
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,599
pythium but there's other pathogens

696
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,240
involved it could be uh biochemical

697
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,639
materials organic copper and phosphate

698
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,599
materials be examples in different

699
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,480
microbials so I'm going to kind of cut

700
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,599
if if you are interested in this I can

701
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,720
send you the PDF of the paper we

702
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,480
published a few years ago but just think

703
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,640
up in the green are all the Biologicals

704
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,759
the trod deras the Basils some of the

705
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,919
major materials that have been used for

706
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,599
a number of years for controlling of

707
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,720
damping off and other cropping systems

708
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,798
those in the middle in red is our

709
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,720
organic copper or phosphate so we'd call

710
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:31,119
these biochemical material the group in

711
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,759
blue as our chemical fungicides our

712
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,918
apron XL Maxum type of materials which

713
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,038
are widely labeled on on most crop seeds

714
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,720
so this these are the seed treatment

715
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,278
lists that we went into with this

716
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,759
project a lot of the screening we do is

717
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,440
in the laboratory is is how can we make

718
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:52,919
sure that some of these have efficacy or

719
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,558
not so we we went to taking a field soil

720
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,240
actually just not too far from here in

721
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,319
East itha that had natural levels of of

722
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,960
pythium present in that soil it's

723
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,720
damping off like see a lot of damping

724
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,319
off in that from that field so we got

725
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,558
the field soil then we're using that

726
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,079
mixed with sand over our roll time you

727
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,558
see the brown paper is from our

728
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:13,119
germination

729
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,759
test uh we're looking at a time course

730
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,398
with the hemp hemp germinate very

731
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,119
rapidly so after four days we're already

732
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,798
seeing a nice rout and shoot on that

733
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,479
after seven days there's quite a bit of

734
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,480
damping off and death of the seed lanes

735
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,440
and then we get to 10 days uh pretty

736
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,558
much everything is wiped out so so that

737
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,919
was kind of our screening

738
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,200
uh assay that we were using uh in my

739
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,360
laboratory this is some of the the data

740
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,880
from that on the far left the black is

741
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,278
the non-treated control the interesting

742
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
thing is we tested all these Biologicals

743
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,960
all the hopes of Biologicals none of

744
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
them are worth of darn none of them

745
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,679
really gave any level of protection the

746
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,038
phosphite material gave some level of

747
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,038
protection in particular the Alum which

748
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,599
is the organic copper with the letter A

749
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,679
on the top was just as good as many of

750
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,079
the the apron

751
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:05,440
Maxum some of the chemical fungicide C

752
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,759
treatments we also through the ir4 did

753
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,200
two years of testing Cornell Virginia

754
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,839
Tech North Dakota state where we had

755
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,240
field testing under multiple

756
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,439
locations and uh just kind of go through

757
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,599
this really quickly but just and this is

758
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,919
just from one of the sites East actually

759
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,119
East itha where we knew we had the the

760
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,679
pythium they were generally seen some of

761
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,798
the the materials now these are the

762
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,880
trade names but there organic materials

763
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,879
the organic biochemical materials

764
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,880
looking quite well in

765
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,038
that so again the biochemical materials

766
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,319
looking quite promising with this also

767
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:46,200
is organic it's already been organically

768
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,439
approved for other applications the

769
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,919
chemicals worked very well but senta

770
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,679
owns those materials and they basically

771
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,679
said we're not interested in supporting

772
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,120
anything on hemp at the time so that

773
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,880
stopped none of our Biologicals really

774
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:05,359
worth worth a d so after we finished

775
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,440
this uh Chris smart and her PhD student

776
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,678
Patrick McMullen uh have done some

777
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,600
additional work we're just kind of

778
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,278
summarizing some of that that work up

779
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,918
now so so there's been continuation and

780
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,880
further uh field testing at Geneva with

781
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,480
some of the the key the kind of our

782
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,519
optimal treatments from this

783
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,919
project okay I'm kind of use this from

784
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,720
the Geneva colleagues are going to

785
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,440
remember some of the people uh

786
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,240
when this was taken I was Department

787
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,798
shair of what we called Horticultural

788
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,079
Sciences at the time so Lan Rego in the

789
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,798
upper leftand corner was the

790
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,398
administrative assistant uh there some

791
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,000
of the people from my laboratory Joe

792
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,038
Shale worked for many many years in the

793
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,599
upper right worked with dick Robinson in

794
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,519
the plant breeding program worked with

795
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:53,119
Thomas borkman and I towards the end of

796
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:56,558
his career uh but the the lower right is

797
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,759
Julia Salena and she's done a lot she

798
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,960
had kind of the good SE

799
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:03,480
physiology training from Bose came to my

800
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,840
laboratory and we're going to kind of

801
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,120
talk into some of the work that she did

802
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,798
not a seed treatment work per se but I

803
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:13,558
thought I'd throw this in just just as I

804
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,000
I like to see uh what people look like

805
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:19,879
way back back in the in the

806
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,440
time all right so seed treatments can

807
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,519
have two different kind of a modes of

808
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,759
movement they can either work as a

809
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,599
contact material some of the older

810
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,038
materials the fungus Ides capan thym

811
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,638
have that type of contact

812
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,839
activity some of the newer many of the

813
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:39,000
newer ones have systemic activity the

814
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,199
systemic activity allows uptake by The

815
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,278
Roots into the transpiration stream all

816
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,880
the way up to the leaves so this when

817
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:47,960
some of our seed treatments some of the

818
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,960
neonicotinoids but others were coming

819
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,558
along we were asking questions we knew

820
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,679
that they're taking up here we're we're

821
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,200
killing cucumber

822
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,360
beetles uh with a systemic sea treatment

823
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,840
but our question was is how are these

824
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,119
materials moving into the are they

825
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,439
moving through the seed coat into the

826
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,239
seed and taken up how how are they

827
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,559
actually moving so that was kind of our

828
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,878
our curiosity at the time first thing is

829
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,918
what and and and this applies if you're

830
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,878
applying herbicides or any other

831
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,358
material and you're looking at systemic

832
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:22,398
uptake what are the physical chemical

833
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,639
properties that that compound has to

834
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,480
have a compound must have a balance

835
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,039
between the hydrophilic and the

836
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,358
hydrophobic char character to enter into

837
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,239
root system some of the classic work was

838
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,719
done on this in the early 80s with

839
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,199
herbicide

840
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,158
moving we have what's called a partition

841
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,598
coefficient where You' put the material

842
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,639
in with water and octanol octol is an

843
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,599
eight carbon alcohol and how does it

844
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,159
partition into those two and that gives

845
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,519
you an idea of that relationship with

846
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,639
the hydrophilic hydrophobic you come up

847
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,039
with kind of this gaussian distribution

848
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,240
or you call it a bell-shaped curve and

849
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,838
number of our treatments are are shown

850
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:06,078
here the thyoxin Meto these are all the

851
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:09,599
neonic ramine B we'll talk about is not

852
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,440
a pesticide but a fluorescent Tracer and

853
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,000
we'll be talking about this in the next

854
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,200
section and then some of the other

855
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,880
materials so all the materials have

856
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:20,480
their own particular log of K also

857
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,400
called the log of P the partition

858
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,760
coefficient so that tells us the

859
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,200
relative water solubility and lipid

860
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,599
solubility but at the top of that

861
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,039
gussian distribution is where there'd be

862
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,320
the greatest amount of systemic uptake

863
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,039
for a particular

864
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,519
compound so again we're we're not

865
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,838
interested in herbicide uptakes we're

866
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,920
really interested in seed coat

867
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,799
permeability how do these materials do

868
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,000
they actually enter into the

869
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,519
seed or are they blocked by the seat

870
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,639
coat so we can have a visual so we

871
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:57,000
decided early on we were doing this work

872
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,239
if we had to get c14 labeled or other

873
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,480
ways of try trying to trace these

874
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,559
materials one it'd be very difficult to

875
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,920
get it it'd be even more difficult to

876
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,599
dispose of this and so we decide at the

877
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,680
time we need a better system that we can

878
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,280
do in a laboratory so we adopted the use

879
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,480
of these fluorescent tracers that had we

880
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,200
could get the particular log of K we

881
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,760
could get a lot of their particular uh

882
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,279
characteristics along with the

883
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,000
fluorescence and mo make sure their

884
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,960
movement why is this important let's say

885
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,599
you have this case was tomato we had a

886
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,079
project a few years ago and then say if

887
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,160
you have an

888
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,720
internal seedborn pathogen a bacterial

889
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,920
pathogen in the embryo and you say well

890
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,279
we're we'll just soak the seeds and the

891
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,358
chemical is going to get to that does it

892
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,240
get the question is does it really get

893
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,799
there so this is what kind of our

894
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,679
inquiry was is is are these materials

895
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,000
that yes you're soaking the seed and yes

896
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,838
they take up water but is the active

897
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,920
material getting to the seed getting to

898
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,880
the embryo more

899
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,800
specifically so we end up with three

900
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,519
classifications based on their seed coat

901
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,880
permeability a soybeans same as our our

902
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,199
Bean family

903
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,358
physis if we have compounds that are

904
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,439
nonionic or ionic in nature both of

905
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,239
those will move through the seed coat so

906
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
in other words we're playing these as as

907
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,078
a seed treatment we put them in a moist

908
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,359
soil and as the seeds take up water it

909
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,920
would basically allow the materials to

910
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,159
migrate into the the embryo so it's a

911
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,920
visualization

912
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,960
of the

913
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,720
movement the next group is in many crops

914
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,800
switch grass we found hemp is going to

915
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,399
be in this onion Tomatoes just a number

916
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,599
of these this is what we call Selective

917
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,519
permal seed coat selective meaning that

918
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,359
only the nonionic compounds which is the

919
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,400
the cumerin which are this light blue

920
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,559
fluoresence that you're seeing is

921
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,519
actually moving into the seed the

922
00:37:53,559 --> 00:38:00,119
rodamine is an ionic material charged

923
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,838
molecule it is being blocked you can see

924
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,079
the tomatoes very Vivid in the Tomato

925
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,039
hairs is that ionic material being

926
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,880
dropped there and not getting into the

927
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,920
embryo and then there's a last group

928
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,400
which we're calling the

929
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,440
nonpermeable and this is with the

930
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,880
cucurbits so cucurbits have particular

931
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,599
morphology with the perisperm endosperm

932
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,160
envelope acts like a little cellophane

933
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,760
around there is blocking both compounds

934
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,598
now when I say non permal people think

935
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,480
is well these seeds take up water

936
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,559
they're not hard seeds no don't be

937
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,000
confused this is not a hard seed in this

938
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:41,039
this is actually the layers that

939
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,719
surround the embryo are actually

940
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,759
barriers and then this just from some of

941
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,480
our reviews and again hemp we added uh

942
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,280
through some of our our earlier work

943
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,440
onto this would be an example of the

944
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,359
selective

945
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,440
permability okay we're going to kind of

946
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,039
take with that basis that we're using FL

947
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,599
ENT tracers and how can we kind of

948
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:06,000
exploit this into kind of in we'll talk

949
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,559
about into a a a weed management and so

950
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,199
when Yu Jing was hired at Geneva as an

951
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,559
engineer uh he had a lot of knowledge

952
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:17,078
and being able to do work with imaging

953
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,599
systems so here we're treating this case

954
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,200
we're just showing some bean seeds with

955
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,680
a rodamine which to us visually be read

956
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,679
but it's also has a strong fluoresence

957
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:29,279
to it the setup that was built with

958
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:32,199
using particular wavelength lights LED

959
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,839
lights and we'll see in the green re

960
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:37,519
where we're exciting uh the ramine and

961
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,039
looking at the fluoresence from that

962
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,880
some of the lights that were set up some

963
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:45,159
of the the physical Hardware that he

964
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,640
developed that we used in our

965
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,719
laboratory so we have non-treated so

966
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,199
we're treating the seed okay we're

967
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,118
treating the seed we're planting the

968
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:59,480
seed the seed grows into a Seedling and

969
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:02,559
then we're looking at does the material

970
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,159
translocate up into the plant so we're

971
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,599
using the white light so we're looking

972
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,759
at reflection of light under the

973
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,400
non-rated and you can see well there's a

974
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,359
green leaf and then we're taking little

975
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,559
leaf disc punch so we can quantify from

976
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,598
a certain surface area and the ramine

977
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,599
treated seed looks about the same way

978
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,760
but now if we look at that the ramine

979
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,440
fluoresence under the fluorescence

980
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,520
detection system the Imaging system I'm

981
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,119
just we're just showing the silhouette

982
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:32,960
where you can't even see the fluoresence

983
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,079
because there's really yeah there's

984
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,838
nothing to be taken up in the

985
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,800
non-treated where you can see exactly

986
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,799
the leaf and particularly the veins of

987
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,839
the leaves why these compounds have

988
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,800
apoplastic movement they're coming up

989
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,159
through the translocation stream and

990
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,720
then they get deposited in into the

991
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,519
leaves but you can see the these

992
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,519
materials quite

993
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:59,519
vividly we we've uh taken that and then

994
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:01,838
with our h project that we had going

995
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,440
concurrently we're looking at and it's

996
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,519
maybe difficult to see but we're looking

997
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,240
at pelleted hemp seeds so our pelleting

998
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:10,199
technology we talked about we actually

999
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,559
had a company do that for us then we're

1000
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,879
adding ramine those on the upper right

1001
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,759
have that purplish color so we actually

1002
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,440
treated those with ramine then so that's

1003
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,440
how we did the seed treatment is by

1004
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,838
treating the pellet again doing the same

1005
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,440
type of of work that we did with the

1006
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:30,199
sampling and so let's just look at the

1007
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,559
graphical part on the right where you're

1008
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,000
seeing just a trace amount of background

1009
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,838
of fluoresence from the he the pellet

1010
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,318
only we're also growing these with a

1011
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:44,159
Velvet Leaf as a weed as our model weed

1012
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:45,838
in this but then where you had the hemp

1013
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,318
pallet with RB which stands for the

1014
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,119
ramine B then we see extremely over

1015
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:55,519
tenfold increase in in the signal so

1016
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:59,039
where are we going with this is bringing

1017
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:01,159
Linn into the the program with this is

1018
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,679
then this could actually go to the field

1019
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,838
where you actually treat the seeds your

1020
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,039
crop

1021
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:11,759
seeds it You' be able to identify those

1022
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,519
seedlings out in the field and then the

1023
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,240
weeds that are around that are not

1024
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,239
having the ramine be so they're not

1025
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,239
taking it up so then you have a way to

1026
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,598
to differentiate based on the

1027
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:27,078
fluorescence profile of the crop the

1028
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,079
treated crop versus the the weed

1029
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,399
and that's just kind of a graphical

1030
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:37,319
abstract from this from the same um just

1031
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,200
kind of as as a landmark for us massis

1032
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:42,639
here we in eug Jing and Lynn we spent a

1033
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,078
lot of time we just finished a paper and

1034
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,879
just got it accepted so this is our big

1035
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:52,519
yay to to get this stuff to see the the

1036
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,480
light of day and and special issue of

1037
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:57,199
exploring application of artificial

1038
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,280
intelligence and image processing and AG

1039
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,679
culture so I thought this is pretty neat

1040
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,760
that we made it with the AI papers as

1041
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,799
well with doing this project with Eugene

1042
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,319
and the

1043
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,920
Imaging all right we're going to the

1044
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,440
last section

1045
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,960
now

1046
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,000
so nothing about Pest Management here

1047
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,480
we're taking a different

1048
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,559
angle we're looking at the law of

1049
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,838
biodiversity which was attributed to the

1050
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,119
use of GMO field crops when we have all

1051
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,440
these herbicide resistance jeans we can

1052
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,240
see soybeans before round up a lot of

1053
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,920
weeds and the farmers hate those weeds

1054
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,199
so when we had the GMO technology then

1055
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,000
we said how clean the fields like

1056
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:44,118
Farmers love no

1057
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,039
weeds the problem is is when we do that

1058
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,280
then we start losing the

1059
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,480
biodiversity the insects some of the

1060
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,519
other

1061
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,240
pollinating and one that we're

1062
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:58,719
interested is particular in is in come

1063
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,879
on in the Monarch the monarch butterfly

1064
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:04,199
the decline of the monarch butterfly the

1065
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,358
Monarch requires milkweed to complete

1066
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,639
its life

1067
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,799
cycle so if we lose the milkweed we

1068
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,279
don't have place for the monarchs to go

1069
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,960
ahead

1070
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,280
into multiply so this is kind of the the

1071
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,838
problem again John Losi from entomology

1072
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:27,319
is a project leader on our current Grant

1073
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:29,480
with this Tony damaso in weed science in

1074
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,719
soil and crop soil so this is just from

1075
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,519
data from the literature of looking at

1076
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,719
this decline in the milkweed so we're

1077
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,838
kind of defining what the problem is

1078
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:42,919
we're also seeing this Con commitment

1079
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:44,159
loss in the Monarch population so to a

1080
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,000
critical

1081
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,358
situation so this this is our kind of

1082
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,159
our our challenge that we took on kind

1083
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,920
of as our Cornell team we already know

1084
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,920
the monic butterfy is now listed as

1085
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,800
endangered by this committee it's just

1086
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,720
came out dangered

1087
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,000
2023 our challenge is how do you restore

1088
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,118
the milkweed population if we could

1089
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,880
restore the milkweed we're hoping that

1090
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,039
we can reestablish the

1091
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,039
monarchs now we have to go to the

1092
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,440
milkweed seed and we look in the lower

1093
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,838
right hand corner the milked seeds we

1094
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,960
have the dimensions there but they're

1095
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:24,440
very flat

1096
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,240
seeds kind of pearshaped seeds so you

1097
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,800
can't use you can't go and use your

1098
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:32,919
conventional planter to plant the seeds

1099
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,318
they're just not handle that there are

1100
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,159
specialized Planters native seed drills

1101
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:38,719
that have been dealt very expensive most

1102
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:42,719
Farmers aren't going to have something

1103
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:45,039
like this so our paradigm shift is let's

1104
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:48,519
develop the new seed technology where we

1105
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:51,599
can plant the milkweed seeds but use the

1106
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,358
farmers existing corn planter or

1107
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,960
existing uh crop

1108
00:45:54,358 --> 00:46:00,119
planter so this kind of is a nutshell of

1109
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,159
what we developed together and actually

1110
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,640
have a patent application on this

1111
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,318
starting off with the

1112
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:09,759
milkweed where then considering this to

1113
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:13,119
go say into a field corn so we're using

1114
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,880
field corn to make 3D molds that shape

1115
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:19,280
of the flat don't if you know corn and

1116
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,960
you do large flat corn seeds is our

1117
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,480
model that we're making here that is

1118
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,079
we're making a mold and then we're

1119
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,599
putting a dough with the seeds inside of

1120
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:31,960
that so this is where we get the

1121
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:34,838
mszp multiple seed ZF for corn

1122
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,920
pellets so we're having

1123
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:40,558
these seeds the milkweed seeds embedded

1124
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,880
into that we can then go ahead and use a

1125
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,559
conventional planter just shows a vacuum

1126
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,920
seeder there on the right hand side that

1127
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,119
we have is a model system in in Geneva

1128
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,200
so we can go ahead and plant those so

1129
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:55,640
this is this is kind of where our our

1130
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,799
first ideas and kind of the conception

1131
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:02,440
of this where we could try to take these

1132
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,000
wild these these pollinator species that

1133
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,159
do not lend themselves to our planting

1134
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,440
technology and then put them in a

1135
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,199
conventional

1136
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,240
planner so where are we now we've done

1137
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,558
the research Innovation now is how you

1138
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,679
going to scale up we're making 40 of

1139
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,119
these mzps at one time well it's going

1140
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:23,199
to take

1141
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:26,200
46,000 to plan an acre well how are we

1142
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:28,719
going to do that huge multiplication so

1143
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,199
the scale of now becomes very critical

1144
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,838
we're working with a company they're

1145
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,879
based outside of Atlanta Georgia called

1146
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:36,358
canar collaborating with them in the

1147
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,838
scale up so that's kind of where we are

1148
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,078
right now but there's already other cor

1149
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:43,719
cortiva on the lower right hand corner

1150
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:47,559
cortiva you may not know the the name

1151
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:49,519
but CA owns Pioneer Seed Company the

1152
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:51,640
largest field crop companies in the

1153
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,920
United States they are going to be our

1154
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,199
conduit to connect this to our rad crop

1155
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,159
Growers so so that is our scheme and

1156
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:02,639
that's what we're work working towards

1157
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:06,679
right now is to get from the the patent

1158
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:08,279
application all the way to agriculture

1159
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,879
so I know I'm probably running over time

1160
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,720
a little bit but I want to thank

1161
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,800
everybody msi's here from my laboratory

1162
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:19,000
and how we've taken and used different

1163
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,680
aspects our tools and Seed Science and

1164
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,800
Technology to address particular

1165
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:28,719
problems in vegetable crops and Beyond

1166
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,359
thank you so much

1167
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,039
questions for

1168
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:37,358
Alan uh Alan thank you that was a a

1169
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:41,159
really good seminar uh so 43 years ago

1170
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:43,078
you called it you said 44 okay going on

1171
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:46,318
to the seed and and and you're

1172
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:49,680
absolutely right so 43 or 44 years from

1173
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:53,679
now what does seed technology look

1174
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,719
like boy Justin so so kind of for

1175
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:59,039
everybody

1176
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:01,118
just oh so so Justine asked that was a

1177
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,838
nice review of some of the things that

1178
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,240
we've done in modern seed technology

1179
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,239
what is the next 40 years look like in

1180
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:11,239
modern seed

1181
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,399
technology so first of all much of the

1182
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:15,519
what work that is going on is going on

1183
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,760
within industry we don't always know

1184
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,759
that until it's actually developed so we

1185
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,480
we have a very small University base

1186
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,799
kind of besides in the US kind of on a

1187
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,159
global basis working in this

1188
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:30,239
area what we're doing right now in

1189
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:33,440
horiculture is we've had the approval to

1190
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:36,078
go ahead and to kind of fill my position

1191
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,920
but basically is to continue in the seed

1192
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,119
biology seed technology area and Larry

1193
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,280
smart is chairing that search committee

1194
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,760
so we're we're hoping to hire a person

1195
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,839
kind of in this General vein well we

1196
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,240
don't know exactly how they're going to

1197
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,199
uh what projects they would do but kind

1198
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,159
of in this general

1199
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:00,318
area but there's there's going to be a

1200
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,118
need because of seed technology of the

1201
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,519
importance of high quality seeds we're

1202
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,318
dealing mostly of veg crops and

1203
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,199
ornamental seeds that are direct seed

1204
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:11,880
field crops it has implications with

1205
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,039
others like the weed seeds with our

1206
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,318
pollinators so there's a lot of use of

1207
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,358
seeds both in agriculture and what's

1208
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,079
goes on in nature so there's a lot of

1209
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:23,798
opportunities a lot of challenges in

1210
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,640
there so that's where I think where the

1211
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:28,639
challenges are going to be

1212
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,759
is you know I was never thinking about

1213
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:34,358
the monarch butterfly when Tony and John

1214
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,799
approached me with this but there it is

1215
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:37,358
and now what are we going to do with it

1216
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,639
so I I think there's going to be a lot

1217
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:43,078
of those aha type of things where we can

1218
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,279
see with with the with the background

1219
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,318
and the knowledge that we've kind of

1220
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,798
started and then others can continue can

1221
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,159
continue in this in this path again

1222
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,920
there's a lot of work that's going on

1223
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,399
with industry so that is going to have

1224
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,639
to be kind of integrated or at least be

1225
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,119
able to be tested before we can even

1226
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:04,000
hand it over to our Growers and say yeah

1227
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,920
you're this is ready to go go ahead and

1228
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,920
do something when it's a pretty new

1229
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,400
technology so so I think there's there's

1230
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,680
definitely the research component but

1231
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,240
also the extension Outreach component

1232
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,440
about what is coming along now and then

1233
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,639
what what may be available for New York

1234
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,280
agriculture in particular vegetable and

1235
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:25,118
other Growers good question and anything

1236
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,559
from Geneva question

1237
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,559
wise um

1238
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,838
I'll jump in here I'm not seeing

1239
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,558
anything on

1240
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:38,798
chat can you can you hear me Steve

1241
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:42,079
reiners oh yes Steve reiners okay Alan

1242
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:44,400
Taylor not so much a question but um

1243
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,000
sort of just wanted to thank you for the

1244
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,519
work that you've done over the years

1245
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,679
because you have been extremely helpful

1246
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,239
to me and I know to many other people as

1247
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,399
we always talked about you always shared

1248
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,279
your toys quite nicely and uh and you

1249
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,639
shared your expertise said for that I

1250
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,720
just really wanted to to thank you for

1251
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:04,598
all the work that we've done together

1252
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:08,039
over the years too so thank

1253
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:10,519
you Dave thank you I mean I think that's

1254
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:13,119
you you know while I'm still makes me

1255
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,239
excited to go to work every day is the

1256
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,960
people that I get to work with you know

1257
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,118
it's it's in horiculture it's outside of

1258
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,318
horiculture it could be somebody at the

1259
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,880
University of GF or it could be somebody

1260
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,599
in in in in the in Washington State

1261
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,960
University so there's always a challenge

1262
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:33,240
and and that really makes it fun for me

1263
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:36,000
uh so so yeah thank thank you for that

1264
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:38,679
that Steve and yes I I do like to share

1265
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,199
our toys

1266
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:46,798
here uh anything else yeah yeah um do

1267
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:49,199
these treatments today exist for tree

1268
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:53,559
seeds and

1269
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:57,279
um do you not in studies that looked at

1270
00:52:53,559 --> 00:53:01,280
um in ulating seeds with

1271
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,280
beneficial micro such as micro of

1272
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,400
Fung for

1273
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,920
example okay the the the question was is

1274
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,318
on tree seeds and where is Seed

1275
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,200
technology on tree

1276
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,318
seeds I'm not aware of any say

1277
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,879
registered materials like a fungicide

1278
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:20,759
even though it would be very effective

1279
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,720
for that I think there would be an

1280
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,240
opportunity and again since I can't

1281
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,519
really answer it is some of the

1282
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,279
biological that would be effective first

1283
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:31,440
for some of the damping off

1284
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,839
organisms um there is some of the The

1285
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,760
Beneficial uh uh fungi some of it comes

1286
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,679
into the delivery system how big are the

1287
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,119
spores that you have to apply what is

1288
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,960
the size of the seed so so some of it is

1289
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,760
is kind of is how do you how do you

1290
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,519
develop the coding technology for that

1291
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,200
particular biological and things like

1292
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:54,079
that so I'm not as definitely not as

1293
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:57,558
knowledgeful what's going on in that

1294
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:01,519
area but kind of as I look at kind of

1295
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:03,720
looking backwards is the vegetable seeds

1296
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,519
because of the value of the seeds and

1297
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:09,318
you have high value small seated crops

1298
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:11,039
lower value large seated crops there's a

1299
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:13,798
lot of different challenges and I think

1300
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,400
a lot of that that's developed then will

1301
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:18,318
spin off and so the the trees not that

1302
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,079
they're not important but there's a lot

1303
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,759
they can they can kind of adopt from

1304
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,280
some of the work that's already being

1305
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,720
done with some of the these other crop

1306
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,920
seeds good now I have to do some HK work

1307
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:33,798
to better answer that question

1308
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,798
right thank you very much all

1309
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,079
right this has been a production of

1310
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:48,078
Corell University on the web at

1311
