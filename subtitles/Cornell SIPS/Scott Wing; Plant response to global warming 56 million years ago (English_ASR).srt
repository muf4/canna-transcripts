1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:18,969
thank you very much Alejandra it's great

4
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:18,969
to be here in the in the frozen north

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:26,810
so this today's talk is going to be in

6
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:31,488
two parts and the first part is about

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:35,539
the topic that's in the title and the

8
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:39,100
second part is is related to that but

9
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:42,829
it's really about recent research that

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,550
project that I've started working on

11
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:48,289
with Richard Barclay who's somebody who

12
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,479
did a postdoc with me and has stayed on

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,390
at the Smithsonian to to do this work

14
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,858
and it's I think you'll see how they're

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,239
related so I hope it doesn't come across

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:02,859
as as too disjointed things because they

17
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:06,679
they really are pretty firmly connected

18
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:11,900
mmm so this is a common graph that a lot

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,090
of people see in an intro geology class

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,009
or earth history class and it's

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,450
basically the temperature history of the

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:22,459
last 65 million years or so as

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,850
reconstructed from oxygen isotope

24
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:30,879
measurements of forums collected mostly

25
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:34,789
through deep sea Corrine programs and

26
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,728
this is I give popular talks so I

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,759
converted this temperature scale to

28
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:43,429
Fahrenheit and then it confuses me when

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,009
I'm not but I won't apologize for that

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,409
we'll just go right ahead here's here's

31
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:51,500
global mean temperature today more or

32
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,700
less and this is this temperature record

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,840
and of course the first thing that pops

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,850
out at anybody is that most of the last

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,250
65 million years have been a lot warmer

36
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,069
than today were in the middle of a

37
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,879
period of glacial interglacial

38
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:11,229
fluctuations and we also of course are

39
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,878
in a period of rapid global warming so

40
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:15,979
trying one thing that Earth historians

41
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,289
can do and the paleobotanist can do is

42
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:21,649
try to to develop a better and

43
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:24,259
standing of the warm climates of the

44
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,329
past as a way of trying to help

45
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,018
understand what might be happening in

46
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:31,670
the future

47
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:37,009
and a lot of my research in the last 25

48
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:39,919
years has focused on a particular very

49
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,949
short interval of time so this is this

50
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,708
spike here is an event called the

51
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:48,018
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum I'm

52
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,188
always curious like how many people in

53
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,340
this room have heard of the

54
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:54,620
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum so you

55
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,750
know some but but not all depends during

56
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,639
a geology department everybody's heard

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,469
of the aliasing Eocene thermal maximum

58
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,659
and doesn't want to hear any more about

59
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:05,060
it because they if they feel like it's

60
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:07,068
been overexposed or something so it's

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,938
nice to see that that this audience is a

62
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:13,668
little more mixed in that way so the the

63
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:18,318
defining features of this of this very

64
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:21,769
short-term warming event are that we see

65
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:25,668
a global excursion as it's called in the

66
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:29,180
in the ratio of carbon-12 carbon-13 and

67
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,859
we see that in in these little 4m shells

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,969
from the bottom of the ocean we see it

69
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:38,120
in organic matter in terrestrial

70
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:40,639
fossil soils we see it in the teeth of

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,069
fossil mammals it's we see it in soil

72
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,150
nodules so it's been picked up around

73
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:49,698
the planet and it's a rather major

74
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,280
change considering that it's global of

75
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:58,669
about 3 to 5 per mil so there's there is

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:05,269
this event that that is one indication

77
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:07,010
of a rather rapid release of a lot of

78
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,949
carbon into the ocean atmosphere system

79
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:13,188
and because it shows up in so many

80
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,829
different places in from the deep sea to

81
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:18,738
the to the middle of continents it's

82
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:21,769
obviously it's obvious that this carbon

83
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,929
release has been mixed by the atmosphere

84
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,569
in the ocean at the

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,228
same time there's global warming and

86
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:32,509
it's was first detected in the oxygen

87
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:35,599
isotope composition of these same kind

88
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:38,990
of little forums here and the global

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,650
warming is about 5 to 8 degrees Celsius

90
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,478
it seems to be about the same amount of

91
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,758
warming from all the way from the poles

92
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,240
to the equator so it doesn't look as if

93
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,280
the warming is happening locally or

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,519
regionally it's really truly global

95
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:59,239
warming and of course that kind of

96
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:02,779
warming is consistent with a big release

97
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,090
of carbon at the same time the third

98
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,418
point here there's extensive dissolution

99
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:10,779
of carbonate in the marine realm so

100
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:14,750
particularly in the in the deep marine

101
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:17,659
at the bottom of the ocean there's a

102
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,860
clay interval a period of time during

103
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,539
which deep sea sediments are are

104
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,660
basically don't have any carbonate in

105
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:29,478
them at all that carbonate dissolution

106
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,820
event is another thing that's consistent

107
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:35,569
with the release of a lot of carbon

108
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:38,538
because you would expect that to to

109
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,500
increase the solubility of carbonate in

110
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:43,819
seawater

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,228
and so you should get a a dissolution

112
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,408
interval if there was a big carbon

113
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:53,168
release this event lasted about 200,000

114
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:57,158
years and because of the warming and the

115
00:05:53,168 --> 00:06:00,829
changes in ocean chemistry it's

116
00:05:57,158 --> 00:06:04,098
generally thought this is about the best

117
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:08,899
analog we have in the geologic record

118
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:11,598
for what humans are doing now so the the

119
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:17,899
interval has attracted a lot of a lot of

120
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:19,759
interest from in the geological sciences

121
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,888
you're probably wondering where the

122
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,919
carbon came from because that's the

123
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:26,478
first question that people ask knowing

124
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,379
that there are no factories to produce

125
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:33,228
it and the the answer is that that after

126
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,550
25 years of working on the event we

127
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,300
don't we still don't really don't know

128
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,968
where the carbon came from and

129
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,620
increasingly it looks as if the reason

130
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:42,990
that it's been hard to figure it out is

131
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,629
because it's coming from multiple

132
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,360
reservoirs of carbon and the reservoir

133
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:52,270
it probably this is a period when

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,490
there's a whole lot of volcanic activity

135
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:58,598
in the North Atlantic the North Atlantic

136
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,490
is rifting open and the sediments that

137
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:02,649
had been deposited in the North Atlantic

138
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,019
over a period of a hundred million years

139
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:08,098
were full of organic matter this is

140
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:11,649
where North Sea oil comes from the

141
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:14,399
reason why Norway and and Britain are

142
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:18,838
such major oil-producing nations today

143
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:21,579
but the bulk volcanism is intruding

144
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:24,939
seals and dikes into these marine

145
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:29,079
sediments and probably generating a lot

146
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:33,729
of carbon dioxide as a consequence it

147
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:36,579
looks as if at some point the warming

148
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:39,668
that's the result of this volcano genic

149
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:43,120
carbon is causing the release of methane

150
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:45,998
hydrate deposits these are deposits in

151
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,550
the ocean floor that are sort of in an

152
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:53,409
ice-like state but you this is ice you

153
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:56,079
can burn and this carbon has an

154
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:59,978
extremely light isotopic composition so

155
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:03,758
this shift in carbon isotope composition

156
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:06,519
that we see that turns out to be a very

157
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,899
useful marker for the event but is also

158
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,228
one of the signs that there's a lot of

159
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:13,870
carbon being released it's a big change

160
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:15,908
in the isotopic composition of carbon on

161
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,949
the surface of the earth it's a little

162
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:20,949
hard to figure out how you could get

163
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:24,459
such a big change but methane hydrate

164
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:26,069
deposits are have a composition of

165
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,978
carbon isotope composition of about

166
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:32,979
minus 60 per mil in the standard Delta

167
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:36,490
notation and that you know like a land

168
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:41,860
plant is minus 27 or minus 28 on average

169
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,599
so this very light carbon is being

170
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,568
released at some point probably as a

171
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,610
result of warming that's initiated by

172
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,229
the volcano genic and it's also possible

173
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,399
that there may be carbon coming

174
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,710
from permafrost or from soils as the

175
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,350
result of either oxidation or a wildfire

176
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,460
so it's a complicated event with

177
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,290
probably multiple perhaps sort of

178
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,930
positive feedback loops that are being

179
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:13,959
generated by warming that initially

180
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:16,389
comes from from volcanism and this is

181
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,160
just to show the sort of give you a

182
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,699
sense of what the planet looks like at

183
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,799
this time 56 million years ago you have

184
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,550
an Arctic Ocean that's completely open

185
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:30,429
no no ice there no land ice in the

186
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:32,079
northern hemisphere and this is where

187
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:34,659
the rifting is happening there are lots

188
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,110
of flood basalts there and I'm gonna

189
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:41,620
sort of focus in on this area in Wyoming

190
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,259
in just a minute this is a map giving

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,870
you a sense of where we have information

192
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:51,460
about the this paleocene-eocene thermal

193
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:56,370
maximum of event on either in shallow

194
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:00,160
marine sections here and here that

195
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:03,129
record in Holland diagrams the shift

196
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,689
across the boundary or in a few places

197
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:10,149
in western North America we have

198
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:13,060
information that's from outcrops that

199
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,909
are actually exposed and the primary one

200
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:17,529
is is here in Wyoming in a place called

201
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:20,919
the Bighorn Basin which is where I've

202
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:24,639
done most of my work and and that's what

203
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:28,929
I'm going to talk about today so this is

204
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:32,740
a very fortuitous thing the mountains

205
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:37,779
are rising around this inter Montaigne

206
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:40,120
Basin from starting about probably 63 or

207
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,009
64 million years ago and going right

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,629
through the paleocene-eocene interval

209
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:48,700
and as a result you know these are these

210
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,740
were weathering off at the time and and

211
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,730
streams were coming down into this

212
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,070
subsiding you know Montaigne Basin and

213
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,029
depositing fluvial soils Alivia

214
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,129
sediments which were then being modified

215
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,208
by soil forming processes and the red

216
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:09,159
stripes you're seeing

217
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:11,888
here are fossilized soil deposits formed

218
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,558
on those ancient floodplains 56 million

219
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:17,528
years ago and this very bright red

220
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:19,539
stripe that you see here is actually the

221
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:23,139
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum are

222
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:26,558
part of it and the fact that that stripe

223
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:30,339
is so thick and so red reflects an

224
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:32,528
increase in weathering rates on land at

225
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:35,709
the same time almost certainly in

226
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:41,828
response to increased temperature and

227
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:44,549
precipitation in this area so I

228
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:47,528
mentioned that carbon isotope excursion

229
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:49,448
in part because not only is it one of

230
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:53,188
the signals that we had a carbon release

231
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:56,378
but it's also a very important tool in

232
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:58,778
correlating from the deep-sea where

233
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,850
we're able to observe changes in in

234
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:02,588
ocean chemistry and marine systems and

235
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,269
the terrestrial systems that I'm

236
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:10,869
interested in and want to talk about

237
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:13,839
today and it also gives us a way of sort

238
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:16,569
of tracking changes in the carbon cycle

239
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,379
so this is these are results from the

240
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:25,838
paper that came out a few years ago we

241
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:27,699
got a opportunity to drill cores in the

242
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
Bighorn Basin through this time interval

243
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:33,399
which is something that's not often done

244
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,110
in continental settings and it gave us

245
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,659
two long records through the

246
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,539
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum at a

247
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:42,419
place called polecat bench which had

248
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:45,669
been investigated over many years

249
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:50,198
looking at the at vertebrate fossils and

250
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:55,058
also changes in soils and and other

251
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:56,798
features and what this core allowed us

252
00:12:55,058 --> 00:13:00,178
to do was to sample essentially

253
00:12:56,798 --> 00:13:03,759
centimeter by centimeter up through time

254
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:05,850
looking at carbonate nodules that form

255
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,669
in these ancient soil horizons and

256
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,540
getting carbon isotope values from them

257
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:16,659
and they give us this very very sharp

258
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,949
this is just a few meters of sediment

259
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:21,779
here

260
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:27,070
a couple of kailia Saul Horizons showing

261
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:28,629
this rapid rapid increase in decrease in

262
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,129
the carbon isotope composition of the

263
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:34,480
soil nodules and then a period of

264
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:37,659
relatively stable but much lower

265
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,009
isotopic composition and then a recovery

266
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:45,039
interval here whereas the as the carbon

267
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:48,039
isotope composition of the soil nodules

268
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,490
increases again back toward the level

269
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:54,129
that it had before the event occurred so

270
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,250
basically this is this is we think

271
00:13:54,129 --> 00:14:00,490
recording the release of this

272
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,429
isotopically very light carbon from the

273
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:09,460
methane hydrate deposits or other

274
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:11,500
sources of light carbon and something

275
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,590
that's just to give you a sense of what

276
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:19,450
that actually looks like in an outcrop

277
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:22,360
and I realize now this and probably you

278
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,520
haven't spent decades going to the same

279
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,889
place or at least not to this same place

280
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,689
which which I had so it's like for me

281
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,669
this I know what the scale of this is

282
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,980
but there's nobody standing in it so you

283
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:37,569
don't but this is just a you know this

284
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:39,850
is each one of these layers here is each

285
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,270
one of these is a fossil soil horizon

286
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:46,480
and that's just a few meters of sediment

287
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:49,059
and this is this is the Paleocene here

288
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,550
this is before the isotope excursion the

289
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,699
isotope excursion starts there and by

290
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:56,500
the time you get up to this soil horizon

291
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,180
you're already in what we call the body

292
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,730
of the carbon isotope excursion so it's

293
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,579
so really really rapid event the

294
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,009
sedimentation rates here are a meter of

295
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,700
sediment represents maybe two or three

296
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:11,620
thousand years so we're talking about a

297
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,210
very rapid release of carbon and this

298
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,070
has actually been one of the things that

299
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,379
we've been working on pretty hard is

300
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,430
trying to understand just how rapid and

301
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:26,110
this is from a paper last year where

302
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:27,579
we've been able to correlate the using

303
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,259
the shape of the carbon isotope

304
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,778
excursion we've been able to correlate

305
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:35,470
from these terrestrial

306
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:37,899
this terrestrial core to marine course

307
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,100
through the same time interval that are

308
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:44,799
that have a cyclic pattern of change in

309
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,120
the iron content of the core and that

310
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:51,870
cyclic pattern is also seen in the cores

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,429
on land and the cyclic pattern is

312
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:59,019
generated by Milankovitch the cliff city

313
00:15:54,429 --> 00:16:04,899
so we've got basically a metronome that

314
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:06,850
gives us these 20,000 21,000 year cycles

315
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,828
which are grouped together at a hundred

316
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,199
thousand year cycles that are controlled

317
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,299
by the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit

318
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,188
and you can see those cycles in the

319
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:17,109
terrestrial realm and you can see them

320
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:19,748
in the marine realm you can sort of

321
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,259
combine that information and conclude

322
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:27,990
that this onset event is less than five

323
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:30,759
thousand years so it's so it's

324
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,909
geologically pretty close to what we

325
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,220
would call instantaneous it's not as

326
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,620
fast as the human addition of carbon to

327
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,769
the atmosphere today is maybe ten times

328
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,159
slower but it's it's still by far the

329
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:48,818
fastest event of this type we know of in

330
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,769
the geological record so this has just

331
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:52,778
made the event that much more

332
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:56,110
interesting to study is to realize that

333
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:59,500
you know it's not a perfect analogue for

334
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,688
the future but it's it's it looks better

335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,788
and better as we get to know more about

336
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:09,129
it the other there's sort of a local

337
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:12,129
practical significance this is now we're

338
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,100
heavily individual adji here but you can

339
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,890
you can detect as I said you can detect

340
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,480
that that carbon isotope excursion in

341
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,839
these soil nodules you can also just

342
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,849
grind up a piece of rock and get the

343
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,849
isotopic composition of the dispersed

344
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,519
organic material in that rock because

345
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,949
these are paleo Sol's and when you do

346
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,129
that you can find this carbon isotope

347
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,950
excursion lots of places the the

348
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,580
Badlands I showed you there are places

349
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,919
where you know every Hill is actually as

350
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:45,669
a record of this event somewhere on that

351
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,580
hill if

352
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,410
you know where to find it so the carbon

353
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:52,869
isotope excursion has something that

354
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:57,009
we've and this is a panel section across

355
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:59,979
about 20 miles of bad land topography

356
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:03,069
where we've been able to locate we're on

357
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,860
a lot of hillsides the carbon isotope

358
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:08,379
excursion is which means that you can go

359
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:10,779
out there and start digging holes

360
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,170
looking for plant fossils which is where

361
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:16,660
my primary research interest is and I

362
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:20,410
just made a little montage here of of

363
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,019
the process since it may be that some of

364
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,480
you haven't had the the life

365
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,970
transforming experience of collecting

366
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,569
plant fossils I know some people have

367
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,750
but but it's if you know you should be

368
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,970
careful it's kind of like your first you

369
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,529
know just I'll just try heroin just once

370
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,059
it's it's uh it's you know you really

371
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:45,460
have to be careful about this because if

372
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,339
you do it you might decide that it's so

373
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,700
much fun you just have to keep doing it

374
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,019
so so these are these are badlands so

375
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,080
that the probably the problem is not

376
00:18:53,019 --> 00:19:00,039
that there's no place to look the

377
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,169
problem is you can look anywhere and you

378
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,420
have to figure out where there actually

379
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,490
are plant fossils in the ground but they

380
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,019
don't wear out so everyone you know if

381
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,049
you're a paleontologist everyone says oh

382
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:14,200
you must go collect dinosaurs no I don't

383
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,490
collect dinosaurs and you know dinosaurs

384
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,779
you might be able to find a dinosaur

385
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,660
because it would be weathering out at

386
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:21,609
the side of a hill but the kind of plant

387
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,880
fossils I find do not weather out they

388
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:27,609
just turn to dust so the only way to

389
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,470
really find them is to go dig a hole

390
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:35,259
with a shovel so your shovel is

391
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:37,299
basically your eyes and the hills look

392
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:40,650
different if you look at them for long

393
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:43,569
enough but I dig a lot of little holes

394
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,330
looking for a place that looks like it

395
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:50,409
the rock might have preserved organic

396
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:52,269
matter and then if we find organic

397
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:58,779
matter you might dig a slightly larger

398
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:59,019
hole and if there's some indication of

399
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,000
Lee

400
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,980
fossils or other kinds of plant fossils

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,339
you might get your friends to come help

402
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:09,099
you and dig a bigger hole and then you

403
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:12,339
can end up in a really good spot you can

404
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:15,339
dig really big holes this is my this is

405
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:17,859
my proudest accomplishment of my career

406
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,379
because if you know what year to look on

407
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:24,189
you can see this whole long on Google

408
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,740
Earth from space so I made a structure

409
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,740
briefly that could be seen from space

410
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:34,990
this is this is a hole that produced

411
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:39,309
some really nice plant fossils this is

412
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:42,700
actually in the PETM and once we find

413
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:46,299
them we use extremely technologically

414
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,830
advanced equipment to bind them up so

415
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:51,039
they don't fall apart on the trip back

416
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:54,189
to the museum and then they they go back

417
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,190
and and sit in the dusty collections

418
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,980
areas and get studied by me and other

419
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,309
people who are interested in them so

420
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:06,700
that's the life cycle of fossils or at

421
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:11,849
least studying fossils and over a period

422
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:14,920
of time I've like this record goes from

423
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:18,519
this is just a piece of the record from

424
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:23,860
56 point to 255 points so this is a

425
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:27,639
million years of time and the record

426
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:30,789
that I've assembled of Flores through

427
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,590
time is goes for another three or four

428
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,119
million years that way and another three

429
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:35,740
or four millions years this way but this

430
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:39,279
is the part of it I wanted to focus on

431
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,420
today and each one of these crosses is a

432
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:46,720
place in the Bighorn Basin where we've

433
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,550
measured a section and we know where we

434
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,100
are in relation to the carbon isotope

435
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:54,579
excursion so time is running this way

436
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:57,069
and I just stacked up the localities so

437
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:00,460
they tend to occur in groupings because

438
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:03,069
once you find an interval of time where

439
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,100
you have good preservation you often

440
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:09,399
find a bunch of sites at that same level

441
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:11,589
where you can find plant fossils and so

442
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,030
we have a bunch of localities here and

443
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:15,069
then a bunch there and

444
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:19,359
and a bunch here at the very end of the

445
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:21,369
Paleolithic urban isotope excursion and

446
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,149
the body of the carbon isotope excursion

447
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:29,500
here and there not as many but there are

448
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,690
now something like 15 sites within the

449
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,910
body of the excursion and then there a

450
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,769
bunch that are during that recovery

451
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,550
interval as the carbon isotope

452
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,529
composition is returning back to what it

453
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:44,319
was before and also the climate is

454
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:46,990
returning to its previous state and then

455
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,279
we have a bunch more localities here so

456
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,740
I just piled them up there about a

457
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:54,309
hundred localities in this million year

458
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,049
interval and so it gives us you know

459
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:59,740
like we don't have a perfect record we

460
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:01,690
wish you know I I would if anyone can

461
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,299
help me fill in that gap that's about a

462
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,549
thirty thousand year long gap right

463
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:11,049
before the onset of the excursion don't

464
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:12,399
have any sites there yeah but but we

465
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,889
have we have a record that we actually

466
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,240
you know can sort of feel pretty decent

467
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:22,650
about using and so I you bring back the

468
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,559
floors you divide them up into

469
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,750
provisional species units and then you

470
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,779
can start to put together a record of

471
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,240
how the flora changed over time and this

472
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:40,299
is a to a paleontologist this is sort of

473
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:42,130
like the most basic standard diagram but

474
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,139
I'm going to explain it to you in case

475
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,990
you're not used to looking at these so

476
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:50,650
this is time again going this way this

477
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,680
that these are the stratigraphic ranges

478
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,769
of different taxa different species

479
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,960
level units and every place where

480
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,569
there's a ball is a locality where it's

481
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,600
actually recorded and I'm making the

482
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:07,720
assumption that the species was present

483
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:10,149
in this area between the places where it

484
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,160
actually occurs but of course it's

485
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,170
always possible that that's incorrect

486
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,700
that it went locally extinct and then

487
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:20,289
came back again and here's again the

488
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,930
body of the carbon isotope excursion

489
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,480
that represents the period when the

490
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,769
climate was the most was the hottest and

491
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,750
the most different from the

492
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:32,349
around climate State and here's the

493
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,390
recovery interval and you can sort of

494
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:36,669
divide this up this range chart

495
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:42,670
stratigraphic range chart up into chunks

496
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:44,320
of ranges of different types and I'm

497
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:50,110
going to describe them and I ask you to

498
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:53,589
notice the the color scheme here of the

499
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:58,419
boxes so in blue

500
00:24:53,589 --> 00:25:01,809
we've got species that come up close to

501
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,220
the end of the peléan we never see them

502
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,159
again

503
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,750
and those are what I would call possible

504
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,390
extinctions at least Reaper mannan

505
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,450
regional extra patient's of those

506
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,370
species you might wonder why they'd all

507
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,100
come up right to the end that's because

508
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:22,209
sampling is not as good as as it might

509
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:23,919
be so you would expect that species that

510
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,529
you don't always sample are going to

511
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,980
sometimes their last occurrence will be

512
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:33,250
before their actual last occurrence

513
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:37,059
there's another group of species here in

514
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:40,180
orange that are have never been detected

515
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:44,289
in the Paleocene and they've never been

516
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:47,170
detected in this area after the PTM

517
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:49,059
they're only found during this period of

518
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,740
warm climate so that's kind of an

519
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,289
interesting that's like you know first

520
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,599
first take on this is these guys are

521
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:58,480
immigrating into this part of the world

522
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,719
during this period of much warmer

523
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,620
climate and then they're disappearing

524
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:10,269
again when the climate cools there are a

525
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:13,569
few taxa that go through that appear to

526
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:16,589
go through the event and then there's

527
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:19,389
another group in green here that show up

528
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:22,149
during the recovery interval or right

529
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,820
after the recovery interval or in some

530
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,190
cases a little bit higher up this again

531
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,740
could be the sampling problem of I see

532
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,430
if I had more sites I might pick up some

533
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:37,329
of these guys a little bit lower down

534
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:40,600
but these appear to be immigrants

535
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:42,398
they're new to the region but they are

536
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,619
showing up during the event they're

537
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:48,849
showing up after the event so they're

538
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:52,388
sort of delayed immigration and then

539
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:55,869
maybe the most interesting group in some

540
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:58,388
ways are these is are these ranges that

541
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:01,569
they they they're present you know in

542
00:26:58,388 --> 00:27:05,288
many of these species are present for a

543
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:09,939
couple of million years down into the

544
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:13,388
Paleocene then strangely they have no

545
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,360
occurrences during the body of the

546
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:19,178
carbon isotope excursion they start to

547
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,888
show up again during the recovery period

548
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:26,019
and then they're found again in the

549
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:30,490
Eocene so these I would call local extra

550
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:33,220
patients they are their species that

551
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:37,269
appear to have gone locally their local

552
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,490
populations have disappeared during the

553
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,980
event they're not present anywhere where

554
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:46,798
I can find fossils of them and then they

555
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:50,048
they come back again after the event so

556
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,359
this results in if you just sort of try

557
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:54,069
to create the broadest scale like would

558
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:58,388
you can you tell the difference between

559
00:27:54,069 --> 00:28:00,189
a PTM flora and a flora from before or

560
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:02,769
after the answer is it's it's really

561
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:06,480
obvious this is a and non-metric

562
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:11,409
multidimensional scaling just a way of

563
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,769
putting in a sites by species matrix and

564
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:20,049
then reducing the dimensionality of the

565
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:23,138
data set to express on two axes the the

566
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:29,048
differences in in floral composition and

567
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:31,658
you can see that the the sites that we

568
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:34,778
have from the body of the excursion have

569
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,809
a composition as reflected on this

570
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:41,138
diagram that is really different from

571
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:43,028
both the Eocene and the paleo scene the

572
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:46,508
Paleocene and Eocene are more similar

573
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:49,119
really to one another than either is to

574
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:52,509
these forests from the body of the PTM

575
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,819
and these red

576
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:58,088
arrows or orange arrows are pointing to

577
00:28:54,819 --> 00:29:00,638
Flora's that occur during the during the

578
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:04,328
recovery interval so the body of the

579
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:06,368
excursion is turns out to be radically

580
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:10,358
different the recovery interval is

581
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:12,249
actually much more like the Flora's from

582
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:14,519
from either before or after the event

583
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:17,709
and there's a lot of overlap between

584
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:23,828
Eocene and Paleocene I've also on this

585
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:25,808
diagram coded each site by the local

586
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:30,459
environment so we get a certain amount

587
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:32,038
of specificity of different plant

588
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:33,788
species showing up in different

589
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,209
depositional environments on the

590
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:41,048
floodplain so we find plant fossils very

591
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:43,619
commonly in small lenses of mud that

592
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:46,778
have filled in channels so the channel

593
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:48,759
abandons and leaves behind mud with

594
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:51,190
plant fossils in it and that's what we

595
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,999
collect but in other places we might

596
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,429
find a layer that goes a long ways

597
00:29:54,999 --> 00:30:00,669
laterally that that shows us we're

598
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:03,309
collecting you know in a in a swamp in a

599
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:05,259
back and a back swamp in a floovio

600
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:06,848
floodplain and it's a different

601
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:10,389
environment so we find slightly

602
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,788
different species in in that kind of

603
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:14,318
environment so I've coded these and the

604
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:18,459
reason I was interested in doing that

605
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:20,318
was just to reassure myself that the we

606
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:22,359
weren't seeing some kind of switch in

607
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:25,418
the environments that would cause the

608
00:30:22,358 --> 00:30:27,548
Flora's to look different and so we

609
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:29,079
wouldn't really be seeing a response to

610
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:31,509
climate change would just be seeing that

611
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:34,989
response to some sort of change in the

612
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:38,548
habitat mosaic on the floodplain and the

613
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:42,088
red circles are the are that's the

614
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:44,318
abandoned Channel Oxbow channel

615
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:47,858
environment and you can see that there

616
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:50,469
are a fair number of those circle

617
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:52,568
symbols in the Paleocene and Eocene and

618
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:54,788
they don't have a flora anything like

619
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:58,928
these aliasing Eocene thermal maximum

620
00:30:54,788 --> 00:31:01,028
flora so I feel reassured that the it's

621
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,409
we're not just seeing some sort of shift

622
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:04,409
in what's being preserved

623
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:10,809
the first thing that might you might it

624
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,309
might occur to you to do is to if you're

625
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:16,480
aware that there are correlations

626
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:20,049
between leaf size and shape and climate

627
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,849
and so we're able to take those fossil

628
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:27,639
leaf taxa and and do basically

629
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:30,219
essentially a characterization of their

630
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,520
sizes and shapes in this case I'm just

631
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,350
going to show you a one slide of results

632
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,970
but this is just to give you a sense of

633
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:41,889
the characters that are being looked at

634
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:43,450
leaf area the number of teeth the ratio

635
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,660
of the number of teeth to the internal

636
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,490
perimeter of the leaf the shape factor

637
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,960
which has to do with the circularity of

638
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:55,210
the leaf the perimeter ratio and the

639
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,880
ferret diameter so these are features

640
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,829
that have some climatic significance but

641
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,420
I'm not really going to use them that

642
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:04,990
way they've been this is a series of

643
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:08,529
modern sites this is work by Dan peppy

644
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:12,430
and others we're looking at at living

645
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:15,160
Flora's across a big range of vegetation

646
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,920
types you're able to characterize them

647
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,550
according to those physique to those

648
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:25,500
leaf size and shape measurements and if

649
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:30,369
you do an ordination analysis of that

650
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,700
you can then place those those different

651
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:35,319
vegetation types in a kind of

652
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,980
physiognomic space so this is the this

653
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:42,519
is a space defined by the leaf size and

654
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:45,400
shape variables and you can see that

655
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,769
there's a bubble here for a seasonally

656
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,560
dry tropical forest there's one here for

657
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:54,339
temperate rainforests and the Paleo

658
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,819
scene Flores and also this is true of

659
00:32:54,339 --> 00:33:01,659
the early Eocene one's fit in this sort

660
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:03,939
of wet temperate rain forest part of

661
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,500
this leaf physiognomic space so this has

662
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,960
got nothing to do with the taxonomic

663
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,450
composition of the flora it's just about

664
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,680
the sizes and shapes of the leaves and

665
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:16,870
the the best site we have from the PTM

666
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,710
where we're able to make these digital

667
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,048
measurements

668
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:22,480
fits in the in the seasonally dry

669
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:24,460
tropical forest part of the of the

670
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,440
diagram so this suggests that we're I

671
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,990
think we're seeing a major change in

672
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,600
vegetation type as well as a turnover in

673
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,429
species composition so just to go back

674
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,230
to this for a second I'm just going to

675
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,360
now show you some of the taxa because

676
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,490
it's always nice to look at a few plant

677
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,490
fossils and and think about what they

678
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:45,069
might be but I'm gonna the there's going

679
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:47,589
to be a color code here the blue the

680
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:50,678
orange for the immigrants the green for

681
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:54,849
the delayed immigrants and the purple

682
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,320
for the extra baited ones so here are a

683
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:59,829
couple of things that we think Oh

684
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:05,678
extinct they're both this is an extinct

685
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:09,489
genus that called browny asiyraytah this

686
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:13,148
is de Vidya which is an extant genus

687
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:16,229
they're both in cornelisz so a clade

688
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:19,960
that has a lot of diversity and in

689
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:23,079
temperate latitudes today and they both

690
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,760
go extinct then they're just to take a

691
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,858
look at some of the things that that are

692
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,810
locally extirpated so again they're

693
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:31,389
there in that paleo scene and they're in

694
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:34,148
the Eocene but we have yet to find them

695
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:36,369
during the body of the carbon isotope

696
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:38,829
excursion and we have a couple of

697
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,169
different types of plot and ACCE

698
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:43,440
this is an extinct genus this one

699
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:46,029
actually is also extinct this is a

700
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,240
trifoliate platano it's something that

701
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,190
is a bit weird by by modern day

702
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:55,658
standards but this is a very these are

703
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:59,050
both very common long ranging species we

704
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,079
have various a couple of common things

705
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,320
that are in the in the betcha lacey ii

706
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:07,659
again probably extinct general but

707
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,599
pretty closely allied with quite

708
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:12,368
recognisably betcha lacey this is

709
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,410
something called fig obso filum which is

710
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:20,500
probably in the fed a sea although even

711
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:24,029
that's uncertain and this is source it

712
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,380
if a lacey so Katsura tree we have

713
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:30,030
something that is essentially identical

714
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:31,750
to extant Metasequoia dawn redwood

715
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:38,370
something almost

716
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:40,869
to modern ginkgo and then we there are

717
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,670
members of the lore AC which are

718
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:44,500
probably you know which is a family

719
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,590
obviously with a lot of a lot of

720
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,449
tropical and sub-tropical

721
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:52,720
lineages in it as well as some temperate

722
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:55,960
so it's not all warm temperate lineages

723
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:59,230
that go extinct or that dope that are

724
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,909
locally extirpated during the event the

725
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,949
the delayed immigrants are also largely

726
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:08,529
have a sort of temperate deciduous or

727
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:11,579
temperate forest look to them this is

728
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,540
something in the Tilley AC II this is

729
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:16,960
all naseeha

730
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:20,380
pistol it inflorescences of this that

731
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:25,210
that make it clear that it is honest we

732
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:28,150
have like odium and this is in the jus

733
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,860
gland AC and very similar to platic

734
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,960
hairy although there's some dispute

735
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,120
about whether it's actually in the genus

736
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,320
Plateau carrier or something very close

737
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,319
to it so these are these species that

738
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,630
come in after the event is over but have

739
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:48,280
not been seen in the paleo scene are

740
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,910
also temperate deciduous species the the

741
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,560
PETM

742
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:53,619
only plants the immigrants that are

743
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,590
there for that brief geologically brief

744
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,909
two hundred thousand year period are

745
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:01,150
really very different at a high

746
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:04,149
taxonomic level so fabaceae are really

747
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:08,889
abundant and also quite diverse there

748
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:13,210
one two three four five different types

749
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:15,339
of asia's foliage on this slide and

750
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,349
there are a couple more that aren't here

751
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,110
there are at least three different kinds

752
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:25,989
of fruits to fabaceae so we really have

753
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:30,400
a lot of diversity and i'm going to just

754
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:33,399
show you oh there's also this is an

755
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,530
extinct genus called land ania that was

756
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,079
named by steve manchester in this

757
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:44,200
Hermanson oh gosh perilously close to 20

758
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,590
years ago the foliage of that is

759
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,339
something that was even

760
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,150
going back even farther was called

761
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,210
Sorella

762
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,250
so it's probably you know whether this

763
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,699
is actually even in melee AC he is

764
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,829
uncertain but it's it has nice pinnately

765
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:03,589
compound leaves that we have and we have

766
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,079
also the flowers and and where we don't

767
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:09,440
have the flowers we do have the fruits

768
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:12,230
from these same PTM deposits it's

769
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:17,659
described from southern Wyoming in a

770
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:21,800
later period of very warm climate this

771
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:24,980
is something that looks very much like

772
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,500
the extant genus gyro carpus we have

773
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,869
fruits with these very long wings on

774
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,900
them too two big wings that come up from

775
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:36,079
the fruit body there are resin glands

776
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,480
that are hard to see in this photograph

777
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,940
but they're there and also in the leaves

778
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,440
these very interesting sort of

779
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:48,380
irregularly lobate leaves and if you

780
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,809
look at extant chiraq harpus americana

781
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,840
which is actually has a pan tropical

782
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:57,139
distribution that's kind of odd but it

783
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:02,870
is it is pan tropically distributed and

784
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:04,879
it likes dry tropical forests so and the

785
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:07,429
this is you know one of those cases

786
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,079
where the fossil even though it's 56

787
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:12,710
million years old really looks a lot

788
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,559
like the modern look there are several

789
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:21,710
living species in gyro carpus and it's

790
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:25,549
it is remarkably similar to those this

791
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:28,670
is one of the Feb ASIS leaf types that

792
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:32,300
we have we don't know which which fruit

793
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:35,930
this goes with but we have some really

794
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:39,740
nice specimens and this particular leaf

795
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:43,329
type has an extremely distinctive the

796
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:46,159
national feature which is it it has a

797
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:48,650
marginal a very thick marginal vein

798
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,210
that's on one side of the leaflet it's

799
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,190
actually the basal side of the leaflet

800
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,099
you can see it in the specimens that are

801
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:58,610
preserved in attachment and on the

802
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,889
apical side of the same leaflet you get

803
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,390
sort of

804
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:04,639
place where the places where the margin

805
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:08,599
is drawn in along the secondary veins

806
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:11,509
and then there's this peculiar splitting

807
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,389
of that marginal vein so that it

808
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,970
connects in two places to the primary of

809
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:21,980
the leaflet and that's that turns out to

810
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:25,299
be a very unusual feature and it shows

811
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:29,240
up in the extant genus copay affero

812
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,060
which they're a bunch of species of in

813
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,809
the new world tropics and it also turns

814
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:40,639
out that it's a it's a genus that seems

815
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:43,909
to like dry tropical for us so we had

816
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,920
the physiognomic data that suggested

817
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:50,239
that this was a dry tropical forest and

818
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,750
now we have just a couple of of taxa

819
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:57,199
that are these immigrants during the PTM

820
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:59,599
and they also as far as we're able to

821
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,799
tell have living relatives in dry

822
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,449
tropical forests and this is just a

823
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,450
family level attempt to show you how

824
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:10,699
different that the PTM is and I think

825
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:15,399
I'm actually going to sort of go through

826
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:17,419
this one quickly because it's not

827
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,550
terrifically important to my point

828
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,450
except just to say that this is this

829
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:26,750
gives you out of all possible

830
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:31,730
occurrences what proportion are seen

831
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:34,849
during the Paleocene in blue the Eocene

832
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:37,250
in green the post PTM Eocene or the PTM

833
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:42,049
in orange and there's some interesting

834
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:46,219
patterns here for instance so betcha

835
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:50,030
lacey is very it's hers in many places

836
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:53,149
before before the PTM in none during the

837
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:56,060
PTM and in lots of in a fairly high

838
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:59,660
proportion of the places in the Eocene

839
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:04,670
and fabaceae as exactly the opposite

840
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:07,639
pattern so we've reconstructed with the

841
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,470
aid of an artist what we think that

842
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,960
transition might have looked like and

843
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:13,189
here's a sort of latest

844
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,909
aliasing relative

845
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:19,760
we wet warm but wet climate with things

846
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:22,429
like ginkgos and metasequoia x' the

847
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,369
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum the

848
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:29,629
body of that event with this dry

849
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:31,220
tropical forest here shown in the dry

850
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,470
season so you can really tell the

851
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:36,439
difference and then in the earliest you

852
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:43,368
see in a return to a similar kind of

853
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:45,170
vegetation to what we had before so what

854
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:48,920
what I think is going on in just sort of

855
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,289
the bio Geographic view of what of what

856
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,139
we're seeing is so we're sitting and

857
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:55,400
detecting all this in one spot and of

858
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:58,639
course we'd love to have many other

859
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,760
places around the planet when where we

860
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:05,118
could record the same event in other

861
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,790
Flores but we don't have them yet but I

862
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,400
think what is likely to be going on is

863
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:13,279
that during the event as the event sets

864
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,000
on we're basically getting as the

865
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,650
climate shifts to much warmer and in the

866
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,230
case of this continental interior also

867
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:26,019
probably much more seasonally dry a

868
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:28,519
precipitation regime we are seeing

869
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:31,519
species that that had been occurring

870
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:33,800
much farther south and then in the image

871
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,500
at the edge of the tropics perhaps

872
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,810
moving their ranges northward we're

873
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,440
getting the local extrication of

874
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:46,338
populations of warm temperate lineages

875
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,130
which are probably then being left as

876
00:43:46,338 --> 00:43:53,119
relics either at high latitudes or in

877
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:55,280
montane areas at mid latitudes during

878
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,440
the during the warm part of the event

879
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,300
during the body of the carbon isotope

880
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,710
excursion there's almost certainly some

881
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:06,310
interchange and this is seen in the

882
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:09,409
fauna as well as in the flora across

883
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:11,659
these whole arctic regions so you're

884
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:14,719
you're getting mixing of phonons and

885
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,730
Flora's between Asia and Europe and

886
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:21,199
North America in spite of the fact that

887
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,818
it they look like we have we have big

888
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:27,049
water gaps here they must not be

889
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:29,090
preventing the migration or

890
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,240
extension of ranges across the high

891
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:35,450
latitudes and then as you go into the

892
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:39,199
recovery and the cooling of climate back

893
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:41,509
into the Eocene basically some of those

894
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,118
species that had gotten across between

895
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,980
continents are moving back into the

896
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,789
temperate regions and that's where we're

897
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:51,559
getting these delayed immigrants the the

898
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:53,599
the temperate lineages that are showing

899
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:57,110
up in North America for the first time

900
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,199
in the Eocene are had been derived from

901
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:04,940
either high latitude areas or from other

902
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:10,399
continents than North America so let me

903
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:13,730
see I have this that's about it isn't it

904
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:19,250
I should be I should be wrapping up and

905
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:20,869
I sort of just did and I'm looking for a

906
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,389
hundred to tell me whether he's like

907
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:27,740
like should I go for I can I can do a

908
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:29,210
very fast version of if but I you know I

909
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:29,509
know people have classes and things like

910
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,210
that

911
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:35,030
five minutes okay I will I will give you

912
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:37,519
the very shortest of all ready so the

913
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,740
the the I've talked about climate change

914
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,960
obviously there's another component this

915
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,989
is like what's the co2 concentration in

916
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,679
the atmosphere this is a Geoscience

917
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:50,629
question and it was and probably

918
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:53,690
everybody's aware of this but you know

919
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:56,030
this spontaneous over a hundred years

920
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,700
ago said and this is a quote from his

921
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:00,109
paper doubling of the percentage of co2

922
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:01,429
in the air would raise the surface

923
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:05,960
temperature of the earth by four degrees

924
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:08,929
Celsius and this is the IPCC report from

925
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,880
2014 saying the likely range of

926
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:12,769
equilibrium climate sensitivity that's

927
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,690
the same number is one and a half to

928
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,579
four and a half degrees C so sort of

929
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,950
feel like how much progress have we made

930
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,659
in a hundred years in knowing what the

931
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:23,059
relationship is between the amount of

932
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:25,368
co2 in the atmosphere and the

933
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:29,059
temperature of the planet it would

934
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:32,329
appear not much so one of the problems

935
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:35,989
is knowing is in answering that question

936
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:38,480
is it takes a long time for the co2 to

937
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:40,819
warm the atmosphere if you have an event

938
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,039
when the amount of co2

939
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,050
miss fear increased a great deal in a

940
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,820
few thousand years you actually have a

941
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:50,000
great setup for answering this question

942
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,920
so the PTM is a place where we're trying

943
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,579
to answer the question and we're trying

944
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,159
to do it with using stomata l-- evidence

945
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:00,409
from fossil ginkgos you all know what

946
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,750
stomata are there's something called

947
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:05,239
stomata index which is the number of

948
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,639
stomata divided through by the number of

949
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:11,119
epidermal cells plus number of stomata

950
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:13,099
we have a may in these same sections

951
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,199
that I've been working in remarkably

952
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:18,079
well-preserved gingko fossils this is

953
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,029
one of this is a 56 point 1 million year

954
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,340
old gingko fossils there's a whole

955
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,580
plastic bag full of gingko fossilized

956
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,760
gingko cuticle and the preservation of

957
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:32,509
these is quite good this is the fossil

958
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,730
this is a living gingko biloba and this

959
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,760
is some work that I did with Dana Roy

960
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:40,219
years ago trying to develop a

961
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,780
calibration for using herbarium sheets

962
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:44,269
like what's the relationship between

963
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,700
that stomata index number and the amount

964
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:48,650
of co2 in the atmosphere over the last

965
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:52,480
couple of hundred years it appeared

966
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,480
there was a very strong relationship

967
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:57,619
rich Barclay the guy I mentioned at the

968
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,570
beginning came to work with me on a

969
00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:02,690
postdoc and we discovered that the

970
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:04,250
picture wasn't quite as pretty as as we

971
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,110
had thought it was when we did the work

972
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,929
back in the early part of this

973
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:14,030
millennium so the relationship is much

974
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:16,699
Messier these are points way out in this

975
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:19,640
so this is this is historical data and

976
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:21,049
these are this is you know a lot more

977
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:24,440
co2 in the atmosphere

978
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:29,410
there had been a few experiments done we

979
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:32,570
applied this we developed basically a

980
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:35,089
reconstruction of changing co2 right

981
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,789
before the PTM and we have a few

982
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:40,340
specimens of gingko from the recovery

983
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:43,840
period and it looks as if there is a

984
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,039
substantial increase from say about

985
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,559
three and a little bit more than

986
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,980
pre-industrial levels like mid-1990

987
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,230
levels of co2 and about a doubling in

988
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,960
the last one

989
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:59,510
thousand years or 50,000 years prior to

990
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,730
the PTM which is consistent with

991
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,400
observed and observed warming of about

992
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,280
five degrees so that that's very cool

993
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,420
except we had a lot of trouble believing

994
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:14,060
that because the calibration curve out

995
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:17,659
here is very poorly constrained by just

996
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:21,858
a few experiments so a few years ago we

997
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:24,199
set up this experiment and suddenly I've

998
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:27,949
been a scientist for 40 years

999
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:32,689
and I can confess you I have never done

1000
00:49:27,949 --> 00:49:34,339
a serious experiment isn't that amazing

1001
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,230
I mean I can say that to a bunch of

1002
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,559
people who work on living plants like

1003
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,539
I've never done an experiment I'm an old

1004
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,449
scientist who never did an experiment

1005
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:46,340
and now we're doing an experiment and my

1006
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:48,679
respect for people who do experiments

1007
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,780
has gone through there is to complain

1008
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,569
about field work but experiments are

1009
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,880
really hard so we're we're you know this

1010
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,180
like we're we have chambers and the

1011
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:03,700
chambers that blowers and we're exposing

1012
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:06,169
ginkgos to 400 outside 400 in chambers

1013
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:08,329
600 and sparts per million in chambers

1014
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,010
800 parts per million in chambers and

1015
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:13,789
thousand parts per million in chamber

1016
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:15,260
and we're met we have like we don't have

1017
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:16,579
armies of grad students at the

1018
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,490
Smithsonian so we have armies of

1019
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:21,949
volunteers working on this project and

1020
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,479
we have online volunteers and you can

1021
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:27,529
help us with this if you want to count

1022
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:29,570
stomata because there's a site here

1023
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:32,359
where you can count them these are

1024
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:36,980
people in the in the cloud counting

1025
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:38,630
stomata for us and so far we're we're

1026
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,340
you know we're it's going to take a few

1027
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,099
years we think for the plants to

1028
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:46,130
actually fully adapt physiologically to

1029
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:48,980
the high co2 conditions we're not seeing

1030
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:51,710
a response yet and we're also trying to

1031
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:54,320
make measurements of conductance and

1032
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,699
photosynthetic rate and we're also

1033
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,050
measuring their carbon isotope

1034
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:59,659
composition because there's some

1035
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:03,650
suggestion that the the amount of

1036
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:05,929
discrimination may be also a possible

1037
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:09,660
proxy for

1038
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:33,779
for co2 so that's the quick version of

1039
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:37,679
that Thanks we did we have no indication

1040
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:40,910
of any c4 plants I mean not in not in

1041
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:45,329
the fossils but also not in the when you

1042
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:48,000
sample floodplain soils for for organic

1043
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:50,400
carbon you know that the composition the

1044
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,389
isotopic composition of the organic

1045
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,269
matter is always consistent with pure c3

1046
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:59,940
but yeah which is interesting because

1047
00:51:57,269 --> 00:52:02,119
during the event well during the event

1048
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:23,849
co2 goes up so maybe that would

1049
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:28,589
disadvantage c4 plants because of your

1050
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:33,299
paper we are and yeah know where we are

1051
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:37,920
we are actually there are 50 leaves on

1052
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:42,060
each tree that are that are marked with

1053
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,210
a little tiny twisty twist high type

1054
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:48,449
thing around the petiole before they

1055
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,269
obsess and there and and they're labeled

1056
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:53,339
with which branch they're on the

1057
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:56,280
branches are numbered on every tree and

1058
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:59,519
the short shoots are numbered so we have

1059
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,019
we know which leaves are not only do we

1060
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,030
know whether they're short shoot or long

1061
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:08,789
shoot we know where on the tree they

1062
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:11,940
came from exactly they're all they're

1063
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:14,820
clones and they're all they're all male

1064
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,679
trees so we are we're trying to

1065
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,330
eliminate some of the sources of

1066
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,329
variation but not all of them

1067
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:37,700
so you think that there's well I don't

1068
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:42,900
know why there's not yet a response i-i

1069
00:53:37,699 --> 00:53:44,819
think these trees are maybe a metre and

1070
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:48,740
a half two meters tall so it's possible

1071
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:51,600
that they are they have enough stored

1072
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:53,909
starch and III mean I think that they

1073
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,339
may take them a little while to to

1074
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:58,679
realize that they're growing I mean they

1075
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,420
they obviously have gingko sirs we

1076
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:07,199
everyone knows ginkgos are stupid so

1077
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:10,579
this is but they they are chain and they

1078
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:12,839
appear to be changing their the the

1079
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:14,909
conductivity of the leaves say if you

1080
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,630
can measure changes in connectivity so

1081
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:22,429
but there may be some history to the

1082
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:25,920
carbon that's already in the in the plan

1083
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:31,199
that's affecting how quickly it respects

1084
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:33,269
it adjusts its the model Anatomy that's

1085
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,819
kind of a made-up thing I mean it could

1086
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:38,639
be that that it could also be that they

1087
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:43,830
don't respond above some level of co2

1088
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:47,069
and that that the entire business of

1089
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:51,509
inferring how much co2 in the atmosphere

1090
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:53,280
is in the atmosphere above 400 parts per

1091
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,880
million or something is just balloon

1092
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,460
juice

1093
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:09,269
I mean it that could be just wrong I

1094
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:11,039
think that remains to be seen this has

1095
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:16,579
been a production of Cornell University

1096
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,579
on the web at Cornell edu
