1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:15,240
University okay so my training is as a

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:17,198
plant systematist and I'm speaking on

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,920
ethnobotany and I guess I will just

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
preface this talk

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,400
saying I have some credentials in the

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,278
ethno part of this since I have an

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,559
undergraduate degree in

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,518
anthropology and I crossed over and

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:33,000
through ethnobotany and tooty became

11
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,920
totally confused by all the plant names

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,519
and uh made a career out of it and later

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
in my career I had some opportunities

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,960
being in Oklahoma and collaborating with

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,558
paleo ethnobotanist and other

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,399
ethnobotanists to do some research so

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,000
there's a lot of serendipity in research

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,439
and I I really like this project it was

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,238
very different than other things I've

20
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,439
done and I I think it has some Merit and

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:00,518
you can be the judge of that so we're

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,039
really f

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:09,000
focusing on three tribes which I'll make

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:12,719
a case for as being uh a good window to

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,719
look at an overall view of ethnobotany

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,239
of the Southern Plains so we're trying

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,920
to reconstruct in many respects

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,759
traditional knowledge so that's a

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,759
difficult task and with each generation

30
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:30,478
more and more information gets lost so

31
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,478
it's very challenging in many respects

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,840
okay just to start off at a general

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,920
level ethnobotany defined it's just

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,320
interactions between cultures and people

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,640
plants and people however you want to

36
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,319
Define it uh and Richard schulties a lot

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,920
of you should be familiar with that name

38
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,000
is often called the father of modern

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,719
ethnobotany and there is an Oklahoma

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,680
connection if you're familiar with

41
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:59,280
schulties so and this is my shout out to

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,079
undergrads here's Shelties on the end if

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,200
I can't see where this thing is okay

44
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,038
he's on your left that's the end of his

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,319
junior year going into his senior year

46
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:14,400
at Harvard he did a three

47
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:17,000
month uh senior thesis research with an

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,519
anthropologist in Oklahoma where we

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,239
spent time with the CA and at that time

50
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,039
nobody had made any kind of inventory of

51
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,719
plants used by the caiway oh they were

52
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,598
buffalo Hunters end the story well lot

53
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,280
more complicated

54
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:35,919
uh and then obviously that led into an

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
incredible career as somebody who

56
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,079
basically defined the field of

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,680
ethnobotany he spent 12 years in the

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
Amazon if you're more interested in

59
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,760
following up on this the classic book by

60
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,598
way Davis One River uh is a good

61
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,519
depiction of that time spent uh based on

62
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,199
his journals a lot of his photographs

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,599
are in the book called The Lost Amazon

64
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,598
also uh put together by Wayde Davis and

65
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,399
then there's a movie just the only

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,280
cinematic uh portrayal of shulties that

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,640
I'm aware of uh Embrace of a serpent

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,878
it's a film from Colombia uh nominated

69
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,518
for best F film uh at the Academy Awards

70
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,039
so a very

71
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,400
interesting uh individual and really

72
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,639
significant okay so let's get back into

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
the Southern Plains we're not in the

74
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,119
Southern Plains here unless I click my

75
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
heels

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,280
together uh anyway

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,000
ecogeographical setting the Shaded area

78
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,479
from an Eco pers uh region perspective

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,519
this is South

80
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,639
Central uh semi arid prairie

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,239
ecosystem uh geographers often have a

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,759
cut off of the central Great Plains and

83
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,319
the southern Great Plains are mostly

84
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,878
concerned with the southern Great Plains

85
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,560
and you can see basically where the

86
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,438
plains Apache the kaiwa and the

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,560
kamanche fit in that Geographic and

88
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,039
ecogeographical scheme what's going to

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,319
be particularly significant unlike many

90
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,318
of the tribes represented in

91
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:13,839
Oklahoma the casa as they are often

92
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:16,719
referred to Kwa Kami Apache uh this was

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
their native territory so they shrunk

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
their territory and other major changes

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
happened but they weren't transported in

96
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,120
here like the Cherokee and other South

97
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,720
Eastern

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,319
tribes whoops okay so let's look at the

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,960
cultural

100
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,959
landscape so what we have here is a

101
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,478
little

102
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,079
map uh and the tribes in red were

103
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,800
basically pneumatic hunting and

104
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,560
Gathering tribes so they hunted bison

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,199
but they did more than hunt bison they

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,478
gathered plant materials and other

107
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,520
natural resources The Agrarian hunting

108
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:55,120
economies are in blue so really in the

109
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,918
Southern Plains it was really a CA the

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,720
kamanche and the plains

111
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,680
Apache and you can see a hatched area

112
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,039
taking in the panhandles of Oklahoma and

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,639
Texas was their original reservation of

114
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,879
course that's much too large so two

115
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,079
years later they shrunk to resz and then

116
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,719
you had the small area and then 1901

117
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,359
they basically eliminated the

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,600
reservation uh some of our early images

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,439
are by George Catlin and you can see an

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,879
image of kamanche Bison hunting there as

121
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,879
well as a Kwa

122
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,439
encampment so I maintain and I'm that's

123
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,560
my thesis that the KCA

124
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,918
are an ideal group to study the Southern

125
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,199
Plains ethnobotany for several reasons

126
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,959
they've been geographically contiguous

127
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,120
really for a couple hundred years they

128
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,879
had a similar economic base which was

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,918
basically hunting and Gathering they had

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,038
a close Association since euroamerican

131
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,038
contact and they actually confederated

132
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,478
politically Under The Medicine Lodge

133
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,959
Treaty of

134
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:04,038
1867 so from a cultural inog geographic

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,638
and economic strategies they were very

136
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:08,759
similar and there was much intermarriage

137
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,000
now these were very disperate tribes

138
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,240
linguistically so to put these in a

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,839
linguistic context each of those tribes

140
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,000
their language is in a different

141
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,359
language

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,399
family so how did they communicate of

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,639
course they many peoples living in

144
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,719
different parts of the world learn

145
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,720
multiple languages unlike Americans this

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,880
is part of their growing up because they

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,960
have to interact with people well they

148
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,598
also use sign language quite a

149
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,478
bit which came in very useful on one of

150
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:40,360
my field trips when I was with a 96y old

151
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:44,318
aache Elder who had no hearing and his

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,319
son communicated by sign

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,720
language so they have a shared cultural

154
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,519
heritage 1700 the plains Apache were

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
closely allied with the kaiwa which

156
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,758
they've kept up all these years that's

157
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,359
where a lot of the intermarriages

158
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
particularly between AA and Apache in

159
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,319
fact for decad

160
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,399
the Apache weren't even known about they

161
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,360
were just assumed to be some group of

162
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:12,478
kowa and then they called them the kowa

163
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,759
Apache uh and more H correctly referred

164
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,038
to as the plains Apache it is a dialect

165
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:21,919
different from some of the other Apache

166
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:25,120
groups uh 1806 the KYW Kam kamanche made

167
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,598
peace 1885 they are actually forced to

168
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
settle a familiar story in American

169
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,800
Indian history

170
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,120
1867 they became confederated and then

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,400
it was like there's another tribe in

172
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:43,720
here so became a KCA reservation in K

173
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,719
KC uh by 1886 the American Bison was

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,120
functionally extrait and this is

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,840
significant because by being restricted

176
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
and being basically forced to become

177
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:57,519
ranchers or Farmers which they were

178
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,759
not uh their economic base evaporated so

179
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,560
that's one way to destroy a culture is

180
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,560
to destroy its

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,879
economy uh the dolls Act was uh enacted

182
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,759
later which eliminated a lot of communal

183
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,879
lands which mean families were given

184
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,720
individual plots which left a lot of

185
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,720
leftover land which was then open for

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,159
settlement uh and the reservation

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,840
dissolved in 1901 so these are very very

188
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,000
significant and of course if you talk to

189
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,959
any of these groups uh I'm not doing it

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,120
justice and just uh going over in such a

191
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,758
short period of time

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,918
okay so let's look at the reservation

193
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,759
area and there's in red the outline of

194
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,240
the reservation which they were in until

195
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,399
1901 and this is where most of the

196
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,719
tribal peoples that haven't relocated

197
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,600
actually are today and that's where

198
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,720
tribal headquarters are so they were

199
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,080
forced to settle on the reservation home

200
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,040
territory

201
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,240
restricted they were restricted to

202
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,519
family allotments so a dramatic change

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,879
particularly when they weren't Farmers

204
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,320
or ranchers uh there no bison and it's a

205
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,399
very sad point in their

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,200
history very proud people have to fight

207
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,720
for scraps thrown off the back of a

208
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,200
wagon

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,480
basically and traditional knowledge of

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,360
course lost in every generation a

211
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,959
familiar familiar

212
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,519
story so let's look at the objectives of

213
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,799
this this is really more of a meta

214
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,399
analysis where I've taken data and then

215
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,958
tried to assemble it and then do

216
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,519
different analysis with the data in this

217
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,879
case the raw data are plant lists use of

218
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,078
plants so I wanted to reconstruct their

219
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,600
floristic and ethnobotanical resources

220
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:46,120
they get that kind of Baseline look at

221
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,000
their use patterns in a floristic

222
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,519
context and in an ethnobotanical context

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,440
like how many plants did they use I mean

224
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,120
what percentage of the floor how does

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,800
this compare to other groups Etc and

226
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,519
test them hypotheses on recorded versus

227
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:07,639
potential economic plant resources Under

228
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,399
reporting of economic plant use and loss

229
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,480
of traditional knowledge these are

230
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,519
difficult things to get at but um it's

231
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,200
something that Anthropologist social

232
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,560
sciences and ethnobotanists have to deal

233
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,920
with but I mean in some respects we're

234
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,119
reconstructing things in scientific

235
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,078
research we try to get data and we try

236
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,959
and make inferences that are consistent

237
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,958
with that data and propose

238
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,600
hypothesis okay the methods compiling

239
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,040
the economic plant data from the few

240
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,639
surveys that are out there from some

241
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,000
direct uh communication with some of the

242
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,399
tribal

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,720
members uh and other scattered sources

244
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,679
in the literature sometimes uh almost

245
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,160
anecdotal and that's the trouble with

246
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,919
any meta analysis you can have different

247
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,719
kinds of data and you kind of have to

248
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,838
stand I it and bring it in and try and

249
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,040
figure it

250
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,360
out uh reconstruct floors for the South

251
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:12,039
Central prair Eco region as well as for

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,440
their reservation and a lot of this

253
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:18,958
relied very heavily on the databases

254
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,480
listed at the bottom so we can't

255
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,439
underestimate the the value of some of

256
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,440
these databases and

257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,800
it's uh invaluable I could not do this

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,320
kind of work otherwise and as most

259
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:36,599
people who use databases and those

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
resources uh the Native American

261
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,680
ethnobot database in particular was very

262
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,679
useful for looking at tribal and plant

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,879
resources okay now I was fortunate and

264
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,480
this also kind of initiated the study in

265
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,759
that there were

266
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,800
three uh important surveys of these this

267
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,838
group in particular the plains Apache

268
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,039
you'll notice Judy Jordan published a

269
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,600
book in

270
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:06,240
2008 and I was instrumental in working

271
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,120
with her she had done her work in the

272
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,839
early 1960s three Summers of intensive

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,480
fieldwork and was granted a master's

274
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,279
degree uh if and her master's thesis was

275
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,240
signed out by people all over the

276
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,519
country why this woman did not get a PhD

277
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,560
is a sad

278
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,919
story but anyway and she lived less than

279
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,399
a mile from where I lived so

280
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,519
I hooked her up she got her notes

281
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,839
together and she published it so I was

282
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,159
very pleased with that but there's sh's

283
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,160
book so three months going into his

284
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,360
senior year ended up with a critical

285
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,159
publication and really the best summary

286
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,199
of plants used by the

287
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,159
Kwa a comman a group out of Michigan

288
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,879
they had a Michigan archaeological

289
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,278
summer station there onlyy Jones was the

290
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:02,958
bnst I believe those vouchers are at

291
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:05,958
Michigan Schult ones are at Harvard and

292
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Judy Jordan are at

293
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,439
Oklahoma so let's get into some of the

294
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,279
summary of the data

295
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,959
okay so I was able to pull these

296
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,559
data

297
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:25,518
and quantify it so if we look at the

298
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:30,239
kaiwa we can verify about 88 species

299
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,759
were recorded the Kaman is much less 68

300
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,240
uh and so I spent more time looking

301
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,120
through the Michigan vouchers which were

302
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,680
actually not in the Michigan herbarium

303
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,879
but were in the anthropological

304
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:46,278
collections uh and luckily I was able to

305
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,958
uh Identify some of the vouchers but

306
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:51,679
some of the vouchers were fragments of

307
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,439
wood uh and I did not Identify some of

308
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,039
those and the plains Apache which

309
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,519
actually took place over three years at

310
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,240
a much greater number so there's some

311
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,839
lessons there in terms of fieldwork

312
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,839
terms of informance Etc because Judy had

313
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,920
multiple informance male and female over

314
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,920
multiple Summers from different family

315
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,360
groups uh as opposed to one or two male

316
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,919
informants during a three-month

317
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,000
period so let's look at the totals I was

318
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,838
able to look at the species present in

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,839
at least one tribe about

320
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,320
175 and species recorded for use among

321
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,720
all tribes so we have three ethnobotanic

322
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,240
surveys only 17 of those are reported in

323
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,720
all three tries so a lot of these data

324
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,079
only appear in one

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,480
survey most of these are native to the

326
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:47,239
Southern Plains 94% 164 five were native

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,240
to North America but are found outside

328
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,959
the region and mostly through trading

329
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,360
they were significant plants from the

330
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,958
south or west

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:01,039
mostly and there were also some Exotics

332
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,039
species not native six species

333
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,839
so I like this graphic and other

334
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,720
individuals have as well because I think

335
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,199
it visually

336
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,519
portrays uh the effect of an obviously

337
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:16,919
Related Group that shared a lot of the

338
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,399
same knowledge of their

339
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,159
resources uh and how little overlap

340
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,799
there was from independent researchers

341
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:29,679
doing these surveys so here's the number

342
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:34,159
of species or the ca the Apache and

343
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,838
kamanche here's the 17 that were shared

344
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,919
and then you can see some are shared

345
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,160
between the Apache and the Kwa some are

346
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:45,439
in surveys in the kamanche and CWA and

347
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:47,159
then 35 between the Apache so by

348
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,199
portraying it this way you realize that

349
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,759
a lot of the information really

350
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,078
just surfaced in one ethnobotanical

351
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,839
survey which means a lot of that

352
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,758
information which was probably there was

353
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,399
not was forgotten by some of the

354
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,360
informants or was not recorded or

355
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,198
whatever sometimes it's proprietary in

356
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,199
in the case of healing plants

357
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Etc let's look by category so there's

358
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,838
lots of things you can do once you get

359
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,120
these kind of data so these are species

360
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,360
used in at least one tribe out of the

361
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,600
175 a large portion of that are

362
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,959
Edibles that makes sense this is the

363
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,000
major supplement to the protein source

364
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:35,318
being primarily bison me not exclusively

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,360
ritual or medicinal plants also a major

366
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,919
major category this is not surprising

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,720
this is through most ethnobotanical

368
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:46,120
research uh a large number again used

369
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,920
for material culture this is quite

370
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,919
important as well personal care and

371
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,439
adornment uh it drops off quite a bit as

372
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,000
you might suspect but most of the many

373
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,600
plants had multiple uses they could be

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,078
edible could a component or a different

375
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,959
plant part could be used medically some

376
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,959
of it could be used

377
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,400
materially so edible plants and in this

378
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:17,318
category I'm keeping it with broad

379
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:20,679
Strokes so we have food stuffs beverages

380
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,879
mcatories additives 91

381
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,199
species uh a lot of these have

382
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,000
underground Parts uh another major

383
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,400
proportion more than half used re

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,359
productive Parts fruits

385
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,960
seeds uh and 20 species saps stems

386
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,678
leaves Etc and two common ones which are

387
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,079
familiar with as well here would be Rus

388
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,080
gabra which is widespread and new Fara

389
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,079
as well which is

390
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:53,519
widespread material culture is very

391
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,120
important uh and if you don't think it

392
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,519
is see how well you survive out there

393
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:01,119
without not just your iPhone everything

394
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,639
else that we purchase construction

395
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,558
materials dyes fibers resins

396
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,440
miscellaneous products a major major

397
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,720
category fibers glaa which is also

398
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,400
multiple use and a lot of that was

399
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,319
edible as well uh the young stems which

400
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,120
are kind of like asparagus as well as

401
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,439
the blossoms are edible and then the

402
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:28,319
fibers and uh a rough Leaf Dogwood which

403
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:33,000
is common in that region uh which often

404
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,678
produces a lot of stems from a crown

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,919
that are equal diameter so they make

406
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,679
good Arrow

407
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:43,520
shifts and ritual medicinal plants many

408
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,640
of these are quite well known uh used

409
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,319
such as eonia widely widely used not

410
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,640
just in this region

411
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,720
peyote uh peyote's been in use for

412
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,720
thousands of years uh and remember the

413
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,360
kamanche were part of the KCA and they

414
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,798
were really WID spread I mean the kowa

415
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,158
too with the kamanchi roamed all over

416
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,599
from Mexico up to the Northern

417
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,760
Plains uh and a lot of what they did is

418
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:14,399
take bwood and other things and they

419
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:16,960
would trade uh but they got exposed to

420
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,880
poot introduced it in the Oklahoma so

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,000
the Oklahoma based tribes the KCA as

422
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,080
well as the Chey and arapo were very

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,038
critical in introducing peyote and the

424
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,079
development of the Native American

425
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:34,960
Church White Sage brush which is also uh

426
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:37,879
well known here is widely

427
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,038
used personal adornment personal care

428
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:45,240
not so many species mon artif fistulosa

429
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,679
this is a mint remember AC uh commonly

430
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,279
used as a

431
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,600
perfume in those hot Southern Plain

432
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,000
Summers a perfume could be a good thing

433
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,480
if you walk through this it's very very

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,159
aromatic with lots of volatile

435
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,839
terpenoids escal Bean

436
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,320
this is actually a psychoactive plant

437
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,399
but a particularly dangerous plant it's

438
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,439
a legume you can see a lament there like

439
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,759
a peanut uh but these are very toxic and

440
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,440
it's very difficult

441
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:17,679
to uh modulate the amount taken without

442
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,919
it being catastrophic kind of like

443
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,038
gimson weed very

444
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,038
similar and sidey O grma

445
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:29,640
balua uh very interesting in the sense

446
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,200
that the the sand or all inflorescences

447
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,038
on one side of the stem look very

448
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,360
similar to warlands and it was very

449
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:39,119
common as an ornament particularly in

450
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,519
ceremonies many of these had multiple

451
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,798
uses two of the most common ones would

452
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:48,839
be the cacti ortia which are abundant in

453
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:51,079
this region edible material

454
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,959
culture ritual

455
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,798
medicinal as well as black walnut plenty

456
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,720
of black walnuts here there's another

457
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:02,480
species of Walnut too the small fruited

458
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,480
Walnut microcarpa edible material

459
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
culture ritual medicinal multiple uses

460
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,519
for these

461
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,278
plants so I just want to go through a

462
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,119
couple plants and then we'll look at the

463
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,759
data from a couple different

464
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,439
perspectives so some of the

465
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:20,319
representative plants the

466
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,480
junipers and juniperus

467
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,399
virginiana uh people are familiar with

468
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,079
this is the structural material for a

469
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,679
lot of uh TPS and things of that nature

470
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,639
you get away from the Rockies you don't

471
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,360
have Lodge Pine it's the name Lodo but

472
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,278
you can use the Cedars but there's a

473
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:42,798
western Cedar on Limestone that pops up

474
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:45,038
and I'm particularly pleased with this

475
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,558
one because I found this out by really

476
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,720
talking to a couple of the elders in the

477
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,678
Apache and they took me to a spot where

478
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,079
they had a different Cedar with a

479
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,360
different

480
00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:00,158
smoke uh obviously a different turpenoid

481
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,879
composition and a different colored

482
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,159
fruit the be you know the cones uh and I

483
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,278
went there and as soon as I saw it I

484
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,278
knew it was Pinchot ey so we were able

485
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:12,640
to actually add that to the list and

486
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:15,119
that was on a sacred Mountain so I felt

487
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,919
very privileged I went there with the 96

488
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,359
year

489
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,759
old uh ex chair of the tribal

490
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,519
council uh who couldn't climb the hill

491
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,519
but he wanted to see it one last time

492
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,918
because he only lived three months after

493
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:35,278
that and he was the last native speaker

494
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,240
for that dialect but the museum at the

495
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:38,519
University of Oklahoma has a very active

496
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,519
program of

497
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,038
recording uh languages and stories by

498
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,960
native speakers and so there's quite an

499
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:52,278
audio library uh for that plain's Apache

500
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,840
dialect because his son who I knew knew

501
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,640
songs and knew some plants but had no

502
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,038
idea what the songs meant or what the

503
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,840
plants were used for so that's a good

504
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,079
example of just one generation loss of

505
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,959
traditional

506
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,918
knowledge uh B dark or if you're from

507
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,919
Texas bow

508
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,919
dark oage orange this is a member of the

509
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,799
mor RAC malb family this is the

510
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,480
preferred W wood for bows particularly a

511
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,400
mixture of the Heartwood with the

512
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,558
sapwood that

513
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,640
interface uh you split the wood radially

514
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,879
and this was the preferred bowwood

515
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,880
throughout the plains

516
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,360
region walnuts little one black the

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,679
microcarpa as well as

518
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,959
Jans uh and very widely used and they

519
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,320
appreciated its beauty as well it is

520
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,960
arguably one of the most beautiful

521
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,759
native North American woods and here's a

522
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,600
kowa cradle board that's quite

523
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,278
spectacular as well as being

524
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,599
functional White Sage Brush very very

525
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:59,359
well known including in this region

526
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,959
emesia Luda visana

527
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,158
uh there's a plants database

528
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,000
map I guess you don't have it if you're

529
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,159
up in Alaska but other than that widely

530
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,798
widely

531
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,640
used and I guess Alabama people are

532
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,639
missing out on

533
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:19,839
this I won't comment on that

534
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,399
further okay Indian breadroot this is

535
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,398
the last of these I'll show very very

536
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,240
critical plant uh it's still fairly

537
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:31,639
abundant in the Northern Plains so a lot

538
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:36,120
of the Sue uh have these plants uh and

539
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,080
include them in their ceremonies but uh

540
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,479
it's getting much more difficult to find

541
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,639
in the southern PLS very important

542
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,038
edible but there are six plants not

543
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,559
native to North America wormwood

544
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:51,000
dandelion Water Crest Sweet Clover

545
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:53,879
Johnson grass and yet they were used H

546
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,319
quite a bit so when plants became

547
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,840
introduced and the native peoples found

548
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,439
them if they knew of a use that

549
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,240
knowledge spread and they Incorporated

550
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,360
it into their

551
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,038
repertoire so and a lot of these have

552
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,439
been around a long period of time so

553
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,440
they were

554
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,918
significant many of these plants used by

555
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:18,278
the KCA were also used outside of the

556
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,000
Southern planes usually um it depends on

557
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,159
the the natural distribution of the

558
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
plants most of the KCA plants are going

559
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
to be uh plants found in the North

560
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,839
American Prairie and the southwestern or

561
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,919
Sonoran floristic Pro

562
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:35,480
provinces but so yaka GLA as you can see

563
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,559
which is mostly Midcontinent has a

564
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,599
Midcontinent tribal use pattern Western

565
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:44,119
soapberry much more

566
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,319
Southwestern uh you pick up the popo as

567
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:52,959
well as the KCA and Rose glaver is used

568
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:54,678
by a multitude of tribes reflecting its

569
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
distribution now if we look at the

570
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,399
archaeological

571
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,278
record and a lot of these records are

572
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,239
from the flotation method a lot of these

573
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:06,558
are

574
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,519
charifi uh you have 75 plants from this

575
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:12,000
Great Plains in the archaeological

576
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,480
record and for those who may not be

577
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,200
familiar it's generally divided into the

578
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Paleo Indian basically 10,000 years and

579
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,440
older the Archaic

580
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,960
Period to about 1,000 BCE Woodland and

581
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,600
then the plains Village merging into the

582
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,079
modder so that's your scale and if we

583
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,879
look at some of the KCA species that are

584
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:39,278
in the archaeological record most of

585
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,880
this data these data are by genus only

586
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,200
it's very difficult to Def to identify a

587
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,200
lot of species that are charcoalified

588
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,600
uh so 47 uh appear in the archaeological

589
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,880
record if we go back in time Plains

590
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,199
Village Woodland archaic paleo you can

591
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
see you drop off the number of plants

592
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,679
but there's five plants

593
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,798
still used that have been in use for

594
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,880
much greater than 10,000 years that's

595
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,000
pretty impressive the other thing that's

596
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,640
interesting is there's several species

597
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
in the record that don't show up in the

598
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:19,000
KCA record so if we look at goosefoot

599
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
chenopodium uh that is a KCA

600
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,480
plant carbonized and sumpweed in the

601
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,839
sunflower family IA anua very widespread

602
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,278
throughout its range

603
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,278
historically in the Paleo ethnobotanical

604
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,919
record no record for the KCA but that's

605
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,679
true for many cultures it seems that

606
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,200
once corn came in they dropped a lot of

607
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,640
these grains that were more like famine

608
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,960
Foods so these are the five plants that

609
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,640
have a greater than 10,000 year record

610
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,880
which I find pretty impressive goosefoot

611
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Choke Cherry caly which you may not be

612
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,320
familiar with remember of the mow family

613
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,320
uh Sun flow as well as a

614
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:08,038
potia so if we summarize the

615
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,600
botney the in an ethn graphic context

616
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,960
we'll see that there's a wide variety of

617
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:16,759
plants used okay they are a lot more

618
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,880
than just bison monolithic bison

619
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,359
Hunters uh and a lot of the plants used

620
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,640
are used by other tribes so there was a

621
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,439
lot of communication shared

622
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,240
knowledge uh which makes has good

623
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,120
survival value it makes perfect

624
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,679
sociological sense there's a long

625
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,759
history of usage for many of these

626
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,320
plants thousands of years in the region

627
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,158
even with the E and flow of different

628
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,359
cultural

629
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,679
groups so I'm proposing that the

630
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,599
combined data particularly given the

631
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,240
nature of ethnobotanical surveys

632
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,398
resulted in a much more complete view of

633
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,000
the plants used by the individual tribes

634
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:58,678
and probably is a more accurate

635
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,960
reflection of their

636
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,320
Collective knowledge base of plant

637
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,480
resources so of course once you get this

638
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,960
there's a lot of other questions how

639
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,159
many plants did they use how thorough

640
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,480
are some of these surveys I've kind of

641
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,440
partially answered that question and the

642
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
real tricky One how can we estimate loss

643
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,840
of traditional knowledge uh other than

644
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,880
saying traditional knowledge is lost in

645
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:28,398
each generation which it obviously is

646
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,440
but it's difficult to kind of quantify

647
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,959
some of these or get a more

648
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,960
robust uh

649
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,759
hypothesis so I reconstructed the floor

650
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,640
of the KCA resz uh this is where the

651
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:48,440
databases come in and came up with 1,89

652
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,159
species for this uh sount region in

653
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,679
Southwestern Oklahoma I was mostly

654
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,200
concerned with the

655
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:59,278
natives so that's a fair number I also

656
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,080
went in which was a lot more challenging

657
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,519
and tried to reconstruct the native

658
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,119
floor of the southern south central

659
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,440
Great Plains Eco

660
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,319
region the floor of the Great Plains was

661
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,240
of limited use because of the region

662
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,200
that it covers and incorporates the

663
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,440
Northern Plains as

664
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,480
well uh so I came up with 28 39 native

665
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,880
species there 12 89 native species for

666
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,278
the res uh and then looking at those

667
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,039
reservation plants with economic uses

668
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:31,919
elsewhere in North America 8 are

669
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:34,599
recorded So almost two out of five

670
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,360
plants on that reservation had some

671
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:41,119
documented history of use by Native

672
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,000
Americans two out of five now there's a

673
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,558
lot of grass species in there a lot of

674
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,839
leum species a lot of astery species but

675
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,278
two out of

676
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,398
five uh are useful and that's pretty

677
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:58,119
remarkable now not all of those were

678
00:30:53,398 --> 00:31:00,719
used but that's the potential resource

679
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:03,158
so in the south central plains you see a

680
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,960
much smaller percentage about

681
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,519
6% and I'm sure the N the numbers were

682
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,399
much larger but with their range

683
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:15,638
restriction uh a lot of that extra

684
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:19,398
reservation Flora was probably

685
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:22,240
forgotten uh and they used 164 native

686
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:24,638
plants that I can document out of 1289

687
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,880
that's 12.7% now that's the figure

688
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,599
that's actually very similar to well do

689
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,639
dou umented ethnobotanical surveys

690
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,798
elsewhere in the world but it's hard to

691
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:36,439
get that kind of data because the tribal

692
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,038
whatever group you're studying just part

693
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,558
of a larger region and they don't just

694
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,638
have a floor that close to this example

695
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,278
would be a Pacific island where you have

696
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:48,038
a discrete floor and a discrete culture

697
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,000
and you can look at a percentage of that

698
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:53,440
floor and we're getting pretty close to

699
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,960
what other people have

700
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,000
recorded um but still there's only

701
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,200
onethird in the plants 164 four out of

702
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,519
508 uh that are

703
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,880
actually uh used or at least recorded

704
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,038
for

705
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,600
use so again potential economic species

706
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:15,240
almost

707
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,798
40% uh actual if we combine the data

708
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,240
from KCA you see we get a

709
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:23,679
12.7% which actually most ethnobotanists

710
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,000
feel comfortable with but if we just

711
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:31,038
looked at individual surveys you can see

712
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,679
the numbers they're much reduced 6.4 4.7

713
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,278
7.8 because of the close ties again

714
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,840
going back to my original argument uh I

715
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:40,798
think this we're getting closer to

716
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,158
having an accurate

717
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:48,398
reconstruction of the ethnobotanical

718
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,720
base so getting into the summaries key

719
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:55,239
points of the use

720
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:58,200
patterns uh about 12.7% almost

721
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,759
133% that's actually very similar ilar

722
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,240
to the floor of South Africa totals

723
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,158
where they've looked at how many plants

724
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,278
were used based on the floor as a whole

725
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,480
but of course there's many many

726
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:13,720
different regions in South

727
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,720
Africa uh and that's the

728
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,278
RSA people have people have that sound

729
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,199
like Donald Trump up here

730
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,480
uh uh talking to ethnobotanist who have

731
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,558
done field work somewhere around 10% is

732
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,519
often a number that they uh come up with

733
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,000
in terms of a ballpark percentage of the

734
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,038
floor that's actually used but only

735
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,119
onethird of the native plants or

736
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:42,200
potential useful plants are actually

737
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,199
used and 40% of those have been used by

738
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,679
some

739
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,759
groups so getting to the

740
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,440
conclusions what kind of evidence do we

741
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,839
have for loss of traditional knowledge

742
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,240
and again we do the best we can with

743
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,480
this uh low usage of economic plants

744
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,798
within the floor of their historic

745
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,240
range uh there are other factors

746
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:07,398
complicating these but that's certainly

747
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,918
a contributing factor uh only 30% of the

748
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:14,519
species recorded for use uh of potential

749
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:16,759
plants are actually used so it's most

750
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,918
undoubtedly an underestimate what we're

751
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,560
coming up with obviously like in any

752
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,000
culture

753
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,358
transcultural uh dispersal of knowledge

754
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,440
and resource use is very important let's

755
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:31,679
look at the spread of corn

756
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,679
if you need an example 30% of the Exotic

757
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,720
Flora is used

758
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,800
economically and then many KCA plants

759
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,918
were widely used among other tribes so

760
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,599
there was obviously much communication

761
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,319
motus a widely used exotic yellow Sweet

762
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,359
Clover second conclusion slide evidence

763
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,679
for Under reporting of ethnobotanical

764
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,519
data and I think this may be some of the

765
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,639
more

766
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:59,639
significant results uh of Interest ethn

767
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:06,519
uh we get very low numbers on these

768
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,960
individual surveys compared to

769
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,719
comparators uh but when we pull it we

770
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,280
actually get a much more reasonable

771
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:16,000
number so I think there's definite Under

772
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,040
reporting in some of these surveys

773
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,559
limited overlap among

774
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,320
tribes uh this gets into ethnographic

775
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,880
sampling questions you just can't go in

776
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,359
and talk to one person imagine if you

777
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,119
were interviewed and say tell me

778
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:34,039
everything about

779
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,720
America uh okay you're gonna get a very

780
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,559
biased and minimalist

781
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,559
subset

782
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,759
so and lastly many Regional economic

783
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,559
species listed are not recorded again in

784
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,359
the

785
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,000
surveys so I I kind of almost end here

786
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,679
with this picture of schulties again and

787
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,400
this is a shout out to you undergrads

788
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,879
you never know where your undergraduate

789
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,318
projects are going to take you

790
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,599
H here Schult signed up for a summer ah

791
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,199
that sounds good I can write my senior

792
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,599
thesis on that his entire career and it

793
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,239
really changed the landscape of Science

794
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,359
in several

795
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,959
disciplines so there he was probably 21

796
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,679
years old that's the morning after a

797
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,240
Peyote

798
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:27,159
ritual you notice he still has his tie

799
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,199
on he's been described as Patrician and

800
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,118
uh

801
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,118
he didn't wear a tie in the

802
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,119
Amazon okay for acknowledgements uh

803
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:39,599
certainly I want to acknowledge the KCA

804
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,200
tribes it's their knowledge and

805
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,838
uh the interactions I've had with them

806
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,759
and some of the representatives they've

807
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:49,318
been very happy to see

808
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,400
this data resurrected Judy Jordan who

809
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,679
wrote that book it's actually been given

810
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,240
an honorific title within the plains of

811
00:36:54,679 --> 00:37:01,199
Pache tribe and she brought to their

812
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:04,439
attention that they forgot about it's

813
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:07,719
way back there in the cultural knowledge

814
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,639
somewhere will ml used to be in Hawaii

815
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,838
then Brit now he's independent in the

816
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,759
Pacific Northwest helped quite a bit

817
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,838
with some of my floristic ethnobotanical

818
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,680
analyses some colleagues at Oklahoma

819
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:22,358
Paul Menace a Paleo ethnobotanist only

820
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,759
likes his plants to cified I assume

821
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,759
that's not true for the Hort

822
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,160
department and a couple grad students

823
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,720
Dan Mormon who put together that

824
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,519
incredible database has been very

825
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,759
helpful he's retired now but he still

826
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:38,280
keeps the database active other people

827
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,720
will help uh Clint flanner who oversees

828
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,079
the anthro collections at Michigan all

829
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,159
these people were very helpful in

830
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,280
putting this together so that's all I

831
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,838
have uh thank you and I'd be happy to

832
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,839
answer some

833
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:59,439
[Applause]

834
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,440
questions questions

835
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,879
I have one Wayne yeah um what evidence

836
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,680
is there of any of these tribes

837
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,920
cultivating any of these plants as

838
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,639
opposed to Simply Gathering them from

839
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,480
the

840
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:20,679
wild well many times there is the model

841
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,679
oh so the question was about were any of

842
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:27,960
these wild plants actually cultivated I

843
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:31,078
mean they were mobile people but at the

844
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,159
same time um and so they really took

845
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,599
careful stock of their

846
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,838
resources

847
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm because sometimes they almost

848
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,559
followed a route they kind of knew where

849
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:45,318
some of the plants were and it's very

850
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:48,199
possible they did that uh certainly if

851
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:49,800
we look at some examples it's very

852
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,639
common in some cultures for people

853
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,079
particularly like K and or whatever to

854
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,159
transplant plants into a medicinal

855
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,640
garden and some of that may have

856
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:04,078
happened particularly if there was a a

857
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:05,480
route in their cyclic Mobility so they

858
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
could come back and knew were certain

859
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,880
plants were so that's likely but we have

860
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,960
no direct evidence of that that's been a

861
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,880
real issue with something like sumpweed

862
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,440
which is really WID spread in the

863
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,358
archaeological record but it's not

864
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,559
reported among many extant tribes at all

865
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:26,639
it's like they just dropped it uh and

866
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,358
then it appears in such numbers

867
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,920
archaological right to make it seem like

868
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:32,799
they were actually it was like an

869
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,880
incipient cultivar in fact individuals

870
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:41,079
are actually trying to redevelop some

871
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,079
weed uh I have not eaten it yet but so

872
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,240
but I I don't have any direct evidence

873
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,960
of

874
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:50,719
that yeah in addition to ethnobotanical

875
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,960
surveys did any of the researchers

876
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:56,199
including yourself look at cultural work

877
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,199
such as creation stories for for

878
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,838
mentions of

879
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,358
significant

880
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,559
plants the actual instructions for how

881
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,000
to use these plants right so the

882
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,920
question is about whether we uh

883
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,838
researchers have also looked in the like

884
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,599
creation stories or uh that would

885
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,559
incorporate some of these significant

886
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,240
plants and I have not directly there are

887
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:24,400
several good

888
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,838
ethnographic books and investigations of

889
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,280
the

890
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,759
KCA uh

891
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,519
and I have not come across that in some

892
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:38,680
of those I tried to peruse a lot of that

893
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:41,400
literature uh and a lot of these even if

894
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:44,118
they're uh referenced in the native

895
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,200
language that language has at least a

896
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,599
English equivalent so you could check it

897
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,480
out uh and I'd have to ask some of my

898
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,440
anthropological colleagues for I mean

899
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,800
there's a member of the Kwa tribe on the

900
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,639
OU anthropology faculty for example

901
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,318
they teach kaiwa I mean you can do your

902
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,519
language requirement learning

903
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,480
kaiwa yeah so yeah I'm I'm not aware of

904
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,079
any

905
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,400
yeah yeah Jerry um Wayne if you look

906
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:15,200
across the range from the plants that

907
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,200
are best known that show up in the most

908
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,399
surveys on down to the ones that you

909
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:23,279
have the fewest records

910
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,720
for uh is that access about the

911
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,079
commonality of the plants or certain

912
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:31,039
types of uses more likely to be showing

913
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,599
up in more

914
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,358
lists well okay so the question was

915
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,240
plants that are commonly recurring

916
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,440
whether it reflects more that they're

917
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,358
very common or they have a a sign

918
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,400
culturally significant use the answer

919
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,679
seems to be more towards the significant

920
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,440
component if something I mean there's a

921
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,358
lot of plants that may be part of the

922
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,000
knowledge

923
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:56,679
base but they may be less desirable it's

924
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,159
kind of like food there's always going

925
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,679
to be preferred

926
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,920
food uh less preferred food and then

927
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,879
famine

928
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:09,000
food uh but nevertheless uh the plants

929
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,920
that really I mean there's like a dirty

930
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,519
dozen many times that just keep

931
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,880
appearing in all these surveys and

932
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:19,199
because they are so critically important

933
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,720
and corus is one of I mean in the Peyote

934
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,558
ceremony they use corcus leaves you know

935
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:27,439
the smoke

936
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:31,800
yeah yeah

937
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,000
you mentioned that uh these the AC KCA

938
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,519
tribes were in three different

939
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,719
linguistic groups but there was probably

940
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,000
a lot of exchange of knowledge on usage

941
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,799
of particular species I was wondering if

942
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,440
like the nomenclature the taxonomy that

943
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,920
the actual or the names that they

944
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,519
referred to those plants got transferred

945
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,960
from culture to culture and if you could

946
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:53,079
kind of come up with the timeline of you

947
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,480
know

948
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,680
this did the commanche tribe used this

949
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,440
plant first and that name got passed

950
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,118
along to the was there any cases like

951
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,559
that where you could make

952
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,318
inferences yeah so the question is about

953
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,960
some of the the naming used by the

954
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,000
different tribes particularly given the

955
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,639
fact that they're they speak languages

956
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,318
in three different

957
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:20,000
families

958
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:23,199
um I guess I'm I have not looked into

959
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,119
that I guess the way I approach this

960
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:29,598
topic as you might guess is as a

961
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,720
botanist doing ethnobotany as opposed to

962
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,240
an ethnographer doing

963
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:38,519
ethnobotany uh so I have not looked into

964
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,159
that I mean we have the names and there

965
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,480
are

966
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,639
uh experts and even tribal members that

967
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,480
are familiar with the language that one

968
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,239
could test that and that would be very

969
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,880
interesting to look at but unfortunately

970
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,879
I I have not pursued that that

971
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:02,039
aspect I think we have time for one more

972
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,039
question does Geneva have

973
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,919
questions Bill yes yeah how many

974
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,480
families are there represented among

975
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,559
these plants that they commonly not only

976
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,280
commonly but entirely

977
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:22,119
used yeah I I didn't include that kind

978
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,359
of information not on this this talk so

979
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,720
I have to go into my data archive in my

980
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,199
brain uh there's quite a large number

981
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,399
and my primary database is all organized

982
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:36,159
taxonomically by Family there's at least

983
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,720
65 families and that maybe an

984
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:42,159
underestimate I mean things like rose AC

985
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:46,879
are very common and things like fabac

986
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:50,639
are very common but there are no seeds

987
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,720
theum seeds that were used which and

988
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,679
there weren't any grass seeds that I I

989
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:58,118
recorded I expected drop seed sporis or

990
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:59,199
something like like that to pop up

991
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,480
because they've appeared in other

992
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:05,679
surveys so I think those are areas where

993
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,679
you know uh some knowledge has been lost

994
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:13,239
look at J would there be more sharing of

995
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:15,239
J among the tree TRS and species yes so

996
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:19,039
and and a lot of my numbers are going

997
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:21,479
down to the species level and sometimes

998
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,880
they didn't you know it depends on the

999
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,920
plant because different species are

1000
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,079
often referred to as a cousin so this is

1001
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,159
a

1002
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:35,839
cousin of another

1003
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:39,078
prunus uh and they leave it at that so

1004
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,039
there is some information that that's

1005
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,039
you know there's a little bit of error

1006
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,960
in that data in the sense that they

1007
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,599
often did not

1008
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,760
discriminate uh so the the

1009
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,720
genus and that's an interesting point

1010
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,880
that you all to or directly elud the

1011
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,799
genus is actually very very critical

1012
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,440
element in a lot of

1013
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,760
nonwestern

1014
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,559
taxonomies but depending on the on the

1015
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,599
plant this this species can be important

1016
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,040
as

1017
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,559
well so I want to thank Professor

1018
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:13,079
Ellison for a fascinating presentation

1019
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,079
thanks so

1020
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:20,000
much this has been a production of

1021
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,000
Cornell University on the web at

1022
