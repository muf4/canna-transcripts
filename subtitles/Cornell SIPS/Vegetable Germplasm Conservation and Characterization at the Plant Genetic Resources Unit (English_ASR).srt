ars national plant germplasm system

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
includes uh

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,238
germplasm repositories across the

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
country

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,199

hawaii

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,759
these include the original plant

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
introduction stations

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,798
various colonial repositories and crop

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,439
specific

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,240
collections and also some

27
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,118
genetic stock collections

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,319
the national plant germplasm system is a

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,438
national

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,798
or network of people and organizations

31
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,919
conserving plant genetic diversity

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,000
it includes both federal state and

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,478
private organizations

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,438
the coordination is by the usda ars

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,840
while most of the funding is federal

36
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:42,399
funding there is also funding from

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,680
state and private organizations

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,478
for example

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
the project at geneva has funding from

40
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,879
cornell through the

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,319
northeast nine project

42
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,599
and i also have different uh companies

43
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,039
see companies i work with like newnames

44
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,000
out in oregon who help with uh

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,000
regenerations of onions

46
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,679
the major

47
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,478
objectives of the national plant

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,879
germplasm system which is the same for

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,599
all the different plant introduction

50
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,039
stations colonial repositories

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,919
etc

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,318
is to acquire germplasm

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,439
to preserve the genetic diversity that

54
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
we have

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,280
to document and catalog this both

56
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,439
passport and characterization and

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
evaluation data

58
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:38,159
to evaluate this germplasm and most

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,879
importantly distribute the germplasm

60
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,239
the germplasm collections are not museum

61
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,759
collections but they're living

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,759
collections which are used

63
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,759
we have two

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,680
uh sites that are national in scope

65
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,239
the national genetic resources

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
laboratory operates the genetic

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,519
resources information network

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
this has all the data available from

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,439
collection

70
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,359
environmental data word material was

71
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,400
collected past

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
characterization and evaluation data

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
and this is available anywhere in the

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
world through the internet

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,360
we are releasing

76
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
shortly beginning october 1st a new

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,560
version of this

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,239
database which is easier for users to

79
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,878
access where they can actually download

80
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,519
large quantities of data through excel

81
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,639
sheets the other

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,280
major activity of this laboratory is the

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,399
plant exchange office they make all the

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,919
uh handle all the issues for germplasm

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,760
exchange internationally both germplasm

86
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,559
coming in the u.s

87
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,878
and germplasm leaving the u.s

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,039
they also arrange for collection

89
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,479
missions because now

90
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,878
with the

91
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,199
national rights for germplasm has come

92
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,000
up in the convention on biological

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
diversity there's many issues of getting

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
permissions

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
and handling benefit sharing for

96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
germplasm

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,438
the other activity of the national

98
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,839
genetic resources laboratory is also

99
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,959
very important is the crop germplasm

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
committees

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,639
these are groups of users and other

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,639
researchers who meet with the curators

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,079
of various crops

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,000
to set issues for example what should be

105
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,839
characterized

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,079
what should be

107
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,159
brought into the collection and deal

108
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,240
with issues such as duplicates and

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
developing vulnerability

110
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,638
statements we also have the national

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,280
seed storage laboratory in fort collins

112
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,600
colorado it's a part of a larger

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,359
national center for genetic resources

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,080
preservation

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,040
but they maintain base collections of

116
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,560
all the germplasm across the country

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,240
in fort collins at -20

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,280
as far as seed they also do research on

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,560
new techniques for preserving germplasm

120
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,679
especially with the clonal repositories

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
right now

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,879
the major clonal collection that's

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,600
preserved is the apple collection

124
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,319
they're trying with using dormant buds

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,120
and liquid nitrogen vapor they're trying

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,038
to develop techniques for other

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,038
clonal crops

128
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,199
that would be as successful as this

129
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,079
technique is with apple

130
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,879
and they also maintain voucher samples

131
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,279
such as the pvp samples

132
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,519
and also some black box collections

133
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,439
where we're just maintaining them as

134
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,439
black boxes with no access

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,439
about the plant genetic resources unit

136
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,399
the national

137
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,639
research and marketing act of 1946

138
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,879
authorized four

139
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,918
regional plant introduction stations

140
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,918
geneva is one of these the others are at

141
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,439
pullman washington ames iowa and griffin

142
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,120
georgia

143
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:16,319
in july 1948 the northeast regional

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,360
project 89 was started

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,400
this was developed into the north

146
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,879
northeastern regional plant introduction

147
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:29,439
station

148
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:32,879
also in 1984 the apple repository was

149
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,879
established as a part of the pgru

150
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,439
it had been established several years

151
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
earlier by cornell university

152
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,439
and was transferred to the plant genetic

153
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,919
resources unit as a federal collection

154
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,519
and this the two of them were merged in

155
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,639
1988 to form the plant genetic resources

156
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,318
unit

157
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,918
so in 19 and since 1984 we've just

158
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,199
added

159
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,918
coats

160
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,400
hearty grapes and tart cherries to the

161
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,399
clonal repository

162
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,198
our objectives are to conserve and

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,079
regenerate plant genetic resources

164
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,120
accessions in the gene bank and in the

165
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,918
field as far as the clonal repositories

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,639
to ensure its long-term availability for

167
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:24,240
research and crop improvement

168
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,800
we are working to strategically expand

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,240
the genetic diversity in the collection

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,960
but also to expand the information both

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,598
passport and characterization data that

172
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,560
we have for these collections

173
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,319
we're working to both genetic do

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,918
genotypic and phenotypic

175
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
characterization

176
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,839
and evaluation of this germplasm to

177
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:51,439
increase the utilization efficiency

178
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,478
um we've started recently both

179
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,680
vegetable and fruit germplasm working on

180
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,279
quality

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,319
nutritional traits and traits that have

182
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,439
a health benefiting effects

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,560
but our major as with the whole

184
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,038
germplasm system major objective is to

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,319
distribute this germplasm

186
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,318
both nationally and internationally

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,160
this shows the vegetable genetic

188
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,038
resources conserved at geneva new york

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,759
as you can see we have a total of about

190
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,038
five hundred 12

191
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,240
eighty

192
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:33,679
half of this collection is tomato

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,320
we have both cultivated and wild this

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,439
sixty six hundred includes about six

195
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,760
hundred accessions of wild tomato

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,000
our other major collections are cold

197
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,399
crops or things such as cabbage

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,759
cauliflower broccoli etc

199
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
and onion

200
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,639
but we do have large collections of

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,839
squash and radish and smaller

202
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,000
collections of tomatillo or hus tomato

203
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,279
celery etc

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,039
uh most of a large part of the tomato

205
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,159
collection is backed up

206
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,399
overall 71 percent of our germplasm is

207
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,879
backed up and this is like i mentioned

208
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,879
before at fort collins colorado

209
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,240
our vegetable collections are basically

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,360
seed propagated collections

211
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,278
most of our crops except tomato

212
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,600
are cross pollinated many are biannual

213
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,480
and again except for tomato

214
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,800
what we actually use to produce seed is

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,879
not the product

216
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,559
so it's unlike other crops like

217
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,720
agronomic crops

218
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,479
we have the problem that it's not the

219
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,040
product that's used for the seed

220
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,039
production

221
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,399
our germ plasma acquisition

222
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,399
is from germplasm collection missions

223
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,879
but more and more

224
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,639
recently has been from other germplasm

225
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,278
collections

226
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,958
and some breeding programs both public

227
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,639
and private

228
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,958
but our acquisition is more targeted now

229
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,759
specific regions

230
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,518
for specific crops or specific traits

231
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
are

232
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,078
certain types of collection

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,200
like we have

234
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,039
integration populations for tomato that

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
we acquired from

236
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,480
israel that are available

237
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,958
and our collections are our germplasm

238
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
acquisition is user directed

239
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,159
again one of the major ways we do this

240
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,278
is through those crop germplasm

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,000
committees

242
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,360
they meet an average of every year to

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,360
year and a half

244
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
at various other meetings we'll have

245
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
this meeting

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,720
also we look at the pattern of seed

247
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,200
requests we see what kinds of

248
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,000
crops are being requested but

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
what type of traits are being requested

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,958
uh

251
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,278
and

252
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:05,278
this is what we're using to

253
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
direct our acquisition efforts

254
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,199
just wanted to show

255
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,199
here is the u.s

256
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,640
and this is

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,800
origins for various vegetable crops

258
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,958
you can see that this shows the

259
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,319
importance of the germplasm collections

260
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,479
that we do have in the u.s

261
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
and one thing you need to point out

262
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
especially in this area

263
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,799
and some of these areas

264
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,040
it's very difficult to obtain access eve

265
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,159
to collect germplasm

266
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:43,039
are to get germplasm back to the us from

267
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,838
other germplasm collections it's very

268
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,078
difficult to access this germplasm now

269
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,720
with the convention on biological

270
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,039
diversity so this stresses the

271
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,079
importance of what we have and

272
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,319
maintaining it

273
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,239
this we did have a collection since i've

274
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
been here in mexico

275
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,278
you can see some of the genetic

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,319
diversity here with tomatoes tomatillo

277
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,320
and some beans

278
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,879
our collection this is a cultivated crop

279
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,278
i had previously been involved in about

280
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,919
35 collections

281
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,559
when i worked at jakarta

282
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:27,278
working with food legumes but the

283
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,518
principles the same oftentimes you go

284
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,838
with cultivated crops to the field as

285
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,039
they're being harvested to collect so

286
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:39,279
you know where the region is

287
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:42,078
but sometimes you go to local markets

288
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,639
which are higher probability that the

289
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,319
crop that's being sold is from that

290
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,600
region

291
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,278
so if you go to a local market in mexico

292
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,519
like puebla

293
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,720
you're probably getting uh crop it was

294
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,639
grown real locally but if you go to the

295
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,079
mexico city

296
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,839
if you go there to a market that that

297
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,919
crop could have come from anywhere in

298
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,920
the country

299
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,920
just an example here with tomato how

300
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,519
germplasm

301
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:18,799
the tomato originated in brazil

302
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,240
i mean in the andes area

303
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,679
it went to south america in the 1500s to

304
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
europe

305
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,919
the original tomato

306
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
germplasm in the u.s came from europe

307
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,559
not from the center of origin or where

308
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,879
the crop was domesticated

309
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,559
and then in 1930s

310
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:41,439
usda collectors and then later cm rick

311
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,919
at the tomato genetic resources center

312
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,839
brought a lot of wild species germplasm

313
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,039
into the u.s and this has been

314
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,200
integrased into the populations

315
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,360
for various traits such as disease

316
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,480
resistance

317
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,879
and other

318
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
pest resistance

319
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,078
again

320
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,159
some of the geographic origins of

321
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,638
brassica here are where you see the

322
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,759
leafy vest the leafy ones

323
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,198
cabbage

324
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,958
down in italy broccoli and cauliflower

325
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,198
and some vindications of early

326
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:17,359
domestication in the mediterranean

327
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:21,198
region eastern part of it

328
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,560
here is an example of a very uh

329
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,278
difficult

330
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,879
to accomplish but we've done it

331
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,480
germplasm exchange with china recently

332
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,679
we received

333
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,278
actually just about one month ago 84

334
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,000
accessions of

335
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,399
chinese cabbage radish and buckwheat

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,039
from china

337
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,639
this is our first official exchange

338
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,399
since the early 1930s with china for

339
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
germplasm

340
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,320
and this is a direct result we had sent

341
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,360
broccoli and cauliflower

342
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,480
to china in 2012.

343
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
uh

344
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,199
and they were very excited with it and

345
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,639
they led to them inviting myself and the

346
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,000
research leader

347
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
dr zhang

348
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,839
to visit them at their expense in

349
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:15,519
september last year about this time of

350
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,000
year we had many discussions there

351
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,480
with the head of germplasm exchange at

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,639
the caes

353
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,120
about bilateral

354
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,959
germplasm exchanges

355
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,360
and we've also recently sent germplasm

356
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,119
of radish in the tomato core collection

357
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,320
to china

358
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
and in about 10 days we expect to have

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
the

360
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,399
vegetable curator from the institute of

361
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,159
vegetables and flowers in beijing

362
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,799
visiting us in

363
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,360
geneva new york

364
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,078
and they want to discuss further

365
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,159
bilateral exchanges of germplasm the

366
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,078
discussions are also going on for the

367
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,198
fruit germplasm but we've already

368
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,599
brought in

369
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,758
vegetable germplasm

370
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,079
this is myself and dr zhang we are here

371
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
with the head of testing laboratory

372
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,479
testing

373
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,039
at the chinese national gene bank in

374
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,039
beijing

375
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,839
we also went to honshu this is the

376
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,078
they're growing out here as you can see

377
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
this is the broccoli and cauliflower we

378
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,120
sent them

379
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,120
they were very anxious that we go down

380
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,639
and visit that

381
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,759
and they're

382
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,839
asking us to come back in the spring

383
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,639
of next year because they hope to have

384
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,480
this in the breeding program full blown

385
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,879
in their breeding program

386
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,759
uh it's about two or three hundred

387
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,198
kilometers from the honshu in the same

388
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,720
province

389
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,879
this is uh close to uh

390
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,000
hong kong

391
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,879
so we've collected uh

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,679
we're

393
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,480
increasing in the exchange of germplasm

394
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,958
the lady here in the red blouse

395
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,120
her name is dr mia tao

396
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,918
she's very instrumental in getting the

397
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,318
germplasm that we did in the u.s

398
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,120
and we're working out protocols with her

399
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,838
that

400
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,359
once germplasm is brought into china

401
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,438
once

402
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,438
that they're going to be maintaining it

403
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,038
and when i receive a request for the

404
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
same accessions

405
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,359
i will transmit it to her

406
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
and then they will do they won't have to

407
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,599
go through quarantine they'll just

408
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
distribute it from the chinese national

409
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,119
gene bank

410
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,400
and they were very

411
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,918
open to this type of distributions

412
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
and so

413
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,240
she said that if they get a request for

414
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,280
what they've sent to me from the u.s

415
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,279
they will do the same

416
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
so we're hoping to expand this germplasm

417
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
exchange to other vegetables

418
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,240
one several concerns we've had with our

419
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,599
collections are gmos

420
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,759
they're difficult to put in the

421
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,918
collections because first of all it's

422
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,000
not one patent there's a series of

423
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
patents and it's very difficult and we

424
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,319
don't want to keep track of all the

425
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,519
different patents and what's still in

426
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,599
place

427
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,839
because it only takes one patent to make

428
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,038
it

429
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,119
non-distributable the other

430
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,119
even more important is the concern about

431
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,159
contamination of

432
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,798
gmo and non-gmo accessions

433
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,200
to the point that we had an inspection

434
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,000
in the office of inspector general

435
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,279
vis we had inspectors come to us several

436
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,960
times

437
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
and go through all our list of

438
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,640
accessions and actually go through the

439
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
gene bank itself

440
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,559
looking to make sure that we didn't have

441
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,038
gmos

442
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,359
the other concern we have is problems

443
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,359
with ipr issues

444
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,079
because these affect what will go in the

445
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,439
collections the mtas

446
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,678
and they may reduce uh to less germplasm

447
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
mentoring

448
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,840
intellectual property rights

449
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,879
and i'll give you a small example of

450
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,599
this

451
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,760
darth dr martha mutchler has double

452
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,079
haploid onions

453
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,519
she was done with them

454
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,639
she really thought they should be

455
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:15,038
available for other people to use

456
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,400
and we accepted to put them in the

457
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,079
collections

458
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,919
but then

459
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,639
cornell's

460
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,520
ipr office got involved

461
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,799
and we had a lot of negotiations

462
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,359
but the mta they wanted

463
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,599
was too much for us to be able to follow

464
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,959
up we don't have the resources to do

465
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,759
that

466
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,679
and so i was told by the national leader

467
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,400
program leader that we could not accept

468
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,240
this type of mta

469
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,440
so the germplasm

470
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,519
we have our finite resources

471
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,519
and staff so we cannot put it into

472
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,279
something that we can't really freely

473
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,119
distribute

474
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,038
and this is going to happen

475
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,599
more in the future

476
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,919
even though she really would like to see

477
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,879
it distributed and be a part of the

478
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,840
collection because of that mta

479
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,559
was not a type of mta we could deal with

480
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:14,399
it's not going in

481
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,960
again these mtas affect our

482
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,600
freedom of distribution

483
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,679
the convention on biological diversity

484
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,199
is affecting collection missions and

485
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
getting permissions

486
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,159
the plan exchange office i mentioned has

487
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,480
a lot more work nowadays for germplasm

488
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,960
collections

489
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,880
we're worried about uncontrolled

490
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
uncontrolled growth of the collections

491
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,120
we have a finite resource for storage

492
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:46,240
for regeneration for characterization

493
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,199
we're trying to avoid duplication

494
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,079
both regionally locally not

495
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
internationally

496
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,678
but

497
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,759
because of the problems it's becoming

498
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,559
more and more difficult to distribute

499
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:05,119
germplasm internationally

500
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:08,158
because of uh intellect uh

501
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,158
property rights

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
also be uh

503
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,639
i didn't mention before quarantine is

504
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
becoming so restrictive in some

505
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
countries

506
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
that

507
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,600
it makes sense to have duplication so

508
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,918
that you don't have to go through this

509
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,359
quarantine

510
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
because they're in some countries like

511
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,719
australia i worked with when i was at

512
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,798
icarda

513
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,880
they gave me a hundred and twenty

514
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,599
thousand dollars a year to work with

515
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,159
fava bean germplasm to screen it for

516
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,000
disease resistance because it cost them

517
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,840
about eight hundred dollars in accession

518
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,720
to bring it in

519
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,399
so it was cheaper to pay us to

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
to go through the whole collection and

521
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,840
get the score so they only brought in

522
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,600
what was needed

523
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:56,399
and they provided pathologists to help

524
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,480
so quarantine issues are becoming very

525
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,880
important for germplasm distribution

526
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
also

527
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,519
our crops are stored in geneva at minus

528
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:10,079
20.

529
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,480
so we maintain our collection at -20

530
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,839
which helps a lot in maintaining the

531
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,759
viability it's also backed up at -20 in

532
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,918
fort collins

533
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,919
our crops as i said before are mostly

534
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:27,599
cross-pollinated and many are biannual

535
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:31,839
so we use cages

536
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,839
and we have bee hives for pollination

537
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,679
this shows here a cage

538
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,038
the cages we use this is in brassica

539
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,720
here

540
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,960
beehives we use the cages we've rented

541
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,200
we just use rented highs because the

542
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,640
economics worked out much better for us

543
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,400
we do do some hand pollination

544
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,919
when we have

545
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
squash

546
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,759
with small numbers of plants it's easy

547
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,919
to do it with hand pollination

548
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,919
just an example this is some broccoli

549
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,799
and tomatoes from this year this

550
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,759
broccoli here actually is one that we're

551
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,480
working with thomas borkman this is

552
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:21,798
actually his his uh population he's

553
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,798
working with with this scri grant

554
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,720
again brassica

555
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,038
we we plant cabbage

556
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,319
about the beginning of august

557
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,720
then in november dig it up

558
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,319
store it and then in early fall set it

559
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,319
out for seed production

560
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,879
again with some of the vegetable

561
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,039
leafy type

562
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,039
brassicas we will have to actually take

563
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,640
them to the greenhouse

564
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,038
our poly house after the

565
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,240
have been grown in the field because we

566
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,640
can't store them over winter

567
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,798
another issue short day onions

568
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,600
here's what short day onions look like

569
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,879
grown versus long day onions in geneva

570
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,279
new york

571
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,840
you can't get them to really bulb

572
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,359
and if you brought bulbs in here

573
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,839
they wouldn't flower

574
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,079
because of the need for short days so we

575
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,678
have an agreement with new mexico state

576
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,879
university

577
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,559
and provide them funds to assist us in

578
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
regeneration of the short days

579
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,839
the main concerns we are concerned with

580
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,520
with

581
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,558
regeneration

582
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,240
is loss of genetic diversity and loss of

583
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,240
genetic identity

584
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,558
we're also concerned about producing

585
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,798
disease-free seed

586
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,119
and also

587
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,158
our brassica and allium is one of the

588
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,558
main reasons we went to minus 20 because

589
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,919
their shelf life is much less than say

590
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,918
squash or tomato

591
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,359
our major another major activity is

592
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,239
characterization of germplasm

593
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,558
this field is in charleston uh south

594
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,440
carolina

595
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,960
well we we work with breeders a lot with

596
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,519
collabora uh in collaboration for uh

597
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,000
characterization i've worked

598
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,000
many agreements with philip griffiths

599
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,359
looking at radish broccoli and

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,240
cauliflower for example

601
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,678
we have a minimal descriptor list we use

602
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,400
for these crops

603
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,080
highly heritable traits and we're

604
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,919
working to increase the

605
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,519
efficiency of utilization of the

606
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,960
germplasm

607
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,720
and increasing

608
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,679
we have an increasing importance of

609
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,640
quality in the past five years

610
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,278
again cg we have this minimal

611
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,000
descriptors list have been developed

612
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,119
on the advice of the cgc's we're working

613
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,119
with

614
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,199
and we've implemented this as part of

615
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,199
our characterization

616
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,440
one other thing

617
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,240
as part of our regeneration

618
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,919
and also regularly now we take digital

619
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
images

620
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,200
that was a strong recommendation from

621
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,400
all five cgc's i have

622
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,519
again we do molecular and

623
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,519
quality evaluation

624
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:20,000
this is a type of

625
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,000
image that we take for onion bulbs

626
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,759
this is what was strongly requested by

627
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,879
the allium cgc

628
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,558
again a

629
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,880
different type of image done with tomato

630
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,759
this one just happens to be one of the

631
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
stuffing tomatoes we have

632
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,440
some of them

633
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,359
look like a red pepper bell pepper when

634
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,640
you see them in the field and people are

635
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,558
surprised when i cut them open

636
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,480
that they see

637
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,200
tomato

638
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,919
the quality characterization has become

639
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,159
more and more important

640
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,320
uh we have already

641
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,559
put quality as part of our

642
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,000
characterization within our regeneration

643
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,798
process for tomato

644
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
i've i'll show you later a tomato core

645
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,400
collection and we've worked on

646
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,759
multi-year

647
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,600
multi-site evaluation of quality for the

648
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,759
tomato core collection with a number of

649
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,399
collaborators

650
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,400
and we hope we're starting now our next

651
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,720
five-year project plan

652
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,159
and we're hoping to expand this to crops

653
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,960
such as onion

654
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,960
and squash

655
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,599
just the nutritional characterization

656
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,840
a standard preparation of samples which

657
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,158
are stored at -20

658
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,959
for later evaluation

659
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
for we have an automatic titrator here

660
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,679
for uh

661
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,519
titratable acidity colorimeter for the

662
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,440
lycopene

663
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:58,079
we measure vitamin c with the kit

664
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,759
we also have worked with the

665
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,119
chemist at the ars in albany

666
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,200
california

667
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,719
for his samples with secondary

668
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,759
metabolites

669
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,558
instead of this they're doing the prep

670
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:17,558
of the sample on liquid nitrogen in

671
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,558
liquid nitrogen at a cryo station

672
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,880
our core set as i mentioned i won't go

673
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,079
over each one but they're basically

674
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,200
different land races heirlooms a group

675
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,359
based on

676
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,319
the geodiversity

677
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,278
fruit shape and then we have

678
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,639
50 we call obsolete varieties these are

679
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,200
where we could

680
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,278
we tried to trace them down to the 40s

681
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,679
50s 60s

682
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,839
70s and 8 80s and 90s where we had pvp

683
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,000
certificates or information other

684
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,798
information that they've released in

685
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,798
these decades

686
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,798
again

687
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,399
we have something from ohio state tomato

688
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:06,798
analyzer to look at the

689
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,798
various morphological traits of tomato

690
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,278
it measures a number of traits

691
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,200
this is uh with heirlooms

692
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,359
several quality traits

693
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,798
and we found two lines fonzilla

694
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,398
and this one is something called avr

695
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,158
avrd6

696
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,079
which stood out for

697
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,640
several of the traits compared to the

698
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,519
other accessions

699
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,159
and the same there were duplications

700
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,200
geodiversity land race heirloom they

701
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,720
don't add up to 184 because some are in

702
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,360
several groups

703
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
this avrd6 was in another group with the

704
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,599
geodiversity

705
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,600
you can see it it's high for all three

706
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,599
traits

707
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,360
and then again

708
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,519
that we found

709
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,199
significant

710
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,200
genotype effects for

711
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,519
these quality traits

712
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,558
one thing that we did

713
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,759
was look at the different decades

714
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,038
accessions from the 50s 60s 70s 80s and

715
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,200
90s

716
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:26,640
we did find a fairly strong with bricks

717
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,159
a trend of reduced bricks

718
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,880
from the 50s through the 90s

719
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,919
and some type of indication for vitamin

720
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,399
c

721
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,520
very small indication with titratable

722
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,319
acidity

723
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,440
so there has been a reduction

724
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,918
for sure in bricks and vitamin c to some

725
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
extent

726
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:55,119
we took the 10 we have more data for the

727
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,720
10th and the 1990s

728
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,439
and what we did was canonical

729
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,360
discriminant analysis and what we had

730
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,640
here was two

731
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,759
years that we grew them

732
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
so for the morphological traits

733
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,079
that

734
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,399
the ten

735
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,798
gave exactly they

736
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,038
were right on top of each other for the

737
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,359
morphological traits

738
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,919
the morphological traits were very good

739
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,359
at distinguishing these varieties from

740
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,320
each other

741
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,319
and while the quality you can see

742
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,879
they're not right on top of each other

743
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,439
they were fairly repeatable

744
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,399
as far as the quality traits for these

745
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,399
ten varieties

746
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,679
we also did a discriminant

747
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,558
and what we were looking at here was

748
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,559
bells gourmet and red bear stick out

749
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,119
from the rest of them

750
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:52,000
and the reason they do this

751
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,278
is for the morphological was

752
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,558
size

753
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,798
traits

754
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,079
they were very different between the red

755
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,398
pair and the bells gourmet

756
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,599
the bell's gourmet

757
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,038
you get fruit that are like three pounds

758
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,000
it's really

759
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,558
huge

760
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,079
the red pear is a very small

761
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,519
tomato

762
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:18,639
whereas here with red pear and belle's

763
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,480
gourmet looking with the quality traits

764
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,120
what we noticed the difference was

765
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,880
the different acids

766
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:32,639
the red pear was double the acid content

767
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,640
of the bells gourmet

768
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,079
we were just trying to see which traits

769
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,960
and that's what showed up here

770
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:47,439
for the quality factor analysis

771
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,440
the first factor was traits the sugar

772
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,038
the second factor was these

773
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,760
acid traits citric acid malic acid

774
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,759
titratable acidity

775
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,798
joanne lebate the molecular biologist

776
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,798
looked at these 50 populations that we

777
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,119
had

778
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,119
for

779
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,398
18 snips

780
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,120
and what she did was divide them up

781
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:18,879
differently she divided them up into

782
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,879
private breeding company

783
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,678
varieties and public varieties developed

784
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,440
by

785
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,278
universities

786
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
and basically there wasn't much

787
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,720
difference between the two populations

788
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,398
it was

789
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,399
there wasn't much difference whether it

790
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,479
was public or private they showed the

791
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,079
same

792
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,079
values in the snips

793
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,558
another

794
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,759
uh work that we're starting on a new

795
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:50,000
project plan is the gis or geographical

796
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,000
information system

797
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,880
and what we're looking at with there are

798
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,440
a set of species

799
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
new species the the new

800
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,798
monograph on tomato

801
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,278
salanum peruvianum

802
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,199
has been divided into four species

803
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:11,119
including peruvianum arcanum

804
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,279
carnellomerlii and julia since

805
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,838
and we were trying to see

806
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,000
the geographic distribution of these

807
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,679
species

808
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,838
and also to see

809
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,639
how it could we distinguish these

810
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:27,358
species with markers

811
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,760
and she used some uh snips some

812
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:33,878
genotyping by sequencing

813
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,879
i had uh 14043

814
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,960
snips

815
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:45,119
and what she did was took the red boxes

816
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,159
this is distance geographical distance

817
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,358
and the

818
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,398
vertical axis is genetic distance

819
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,719
and what she did was uh intra specific

820
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,358
so that would be like

821
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,919
a saline saline improvianum and a slant

822
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,519
improvianum excessions two accessions of

823
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,920
the same species

824
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,079
whereas the blue ones are

825
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,119
two accessions of different species like

826
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,920
peruvian and arcanum

827
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,838
so what you see here with the red ones

828
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,838
the further they are apart

829
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:20,960
physically there's not a relationship

830
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:23,199
with the genetic distance

831
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,519
but you can see there is a relationship

832
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,879
of genetic distance and geographic

833
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,280
distance

834
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,039
for the

835
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,000
inter-specific pairs

836
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,759
so this shows as this the species get

837
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,599
further apart

838
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,599
they're more distinct from each other

839
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,400
and

840
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
this is shown when you try to

841
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,480
taxonomically key these out which we

842
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
took all 200 and did

843
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,800
we ran into problems and i think you can

844
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,599
see that if they're close to each other

845
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,920
in geographic distance they become

846
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,280
more close in genetic distance and it

847
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,280
becomes more difficult

848
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,039
she looked at him in a with a heat map

849
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,279
basically

850
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,759
some species are easy to tell apart

851
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,320
peruvian and arcanum

852
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
so here the this is the frequency of one

853
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,800
species or canon and this is the

854
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,760
frequency of the allele

855
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
and uh uh

856
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,719
peruvian

857
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,559
so the darker this is the number

858
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,078
the greater the number

859
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,599
of alleles

860
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,720
so you can see a pattern like this

861
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,280
so it's

862
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:38,559
these two species are separate are

863
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,519
easily easily more easily separated

864
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,119
whereas peruvianum and cornell myrlie

865
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,838
which is what we saw in the field was

866
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,160
very difficult to tell them apart

867
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,159
you can see with the snips

868
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,000
that there's not this pattern which

869
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,838
would distinguish them from each other

870
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,838
as far as allele frequencies

871
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,879
again she used

872
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,879
the same data

873
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,440
here is our canon

874
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,440
fairly easy to separate it from the rest

875
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,480
and then the rest of them were up here

876
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,400
except

877
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
julia sense

878
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,480
we had a number of these that we could

879
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,879
tell right away

880
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,039
but some that were more difficult and

881
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,200
that was these

882
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,199
so the species taxonomically

883
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,440
that the taxonomists have made

884
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,358
you run into problems with certain ones

885
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,039
and it's probably because of gene flow

886
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,559
between the species

887
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,559
actually telling them apart

888
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,880
again with characterization

889
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,800
and evaluation we're concerned about

890
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,760
importance and heritability of our

891
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,320
traits and reporting disease scores

892
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,599
consistently

893
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,480
replication both in time

894
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,480
and environment

895
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,039
also we have like with tomato we have

896
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,160
multi-location multi-year

897
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:12,639
evaluations and comparisons

898
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:16,078
and again as i mentioned

899
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:19,118
with not only at geneva but at other

900
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,839
plant introduction stations repositories

901
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,240
there's concern about quality nutrition

902
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,239
and health benefit traits oops

903
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,039
two

904
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,000
we work with outreach and training and

905
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,719
germplasm conservation and regeneration

906
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,480
with markers and seed production and

907
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:42,000
seed storage

908
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,159
for characterization and evaluation

909
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,280
and we do have outreach efforts in c

910
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,358
production for organic production both

911
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,880
processing and actual control

912
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,039
pollinations

913
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,519
and we've worked with demonstrations and

914
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,400
field days

915
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,599
we've had three projects the public seed

916
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,320
initiative

917
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,359
which was ifas funded

918
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,440
and the organic seed partnership and the

919
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,000
northern organic vegetable improvement

920
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,800
collaborative novik

921
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,559
those have been funded by the

922
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,760
orei the first two were with dr molly

923
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,320
john

924
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,839
the novik the last one has been with dr

925
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,960
michael missouri

926
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,960
as a collaborator

927
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,240
the novik again is uh cornell is part of

928
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,880
that oregon state with university of

929
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:39,279
wisconsin washington state

930
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:43,280
also uh ngo the organic seed alliance

931
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,280
and ourselves the usda

932
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,599
this northern organic vegetable

933
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,920
improvement collaborative

934
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
is working as you can see here we're

935
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,079
working with seed production

936
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,519
seed processing

937
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,560
also we're looking at testing of organic

938
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,320
varieties on farmers fields under

939
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,719
organic conditions

940
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,359
so that they can grow varieties which

941
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,959
perform best under their conditions

942
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,119
and the breeding programs have been

943
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,519
working on uh

944
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,559
besides disease resistance also

945
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:19,679
extending uh the season

946
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,320
like with sweet corn making developing

947
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:25,838
sweet corn which is more cold tolerant

948
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:30,160
at the seedling stage

949
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:32,559
here's uh at pgru working with some

950
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,559
people with uh training and seed

951
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:38,000
cleaning

952
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,880
we've this is a public seed initiative

953
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,039
we were at a the organic field day here

954
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,039
at freeville

955
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,159
two weeks ago

956
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:51,519
my staff and i were at the organic field

957
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,519
day again in freeville

958
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,400
we also go

959
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
regularly to the common fair grou ground

960
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,280
fare

961
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,679
showing different aspects of seed

962
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,079
production

963
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,960
and providing information for different

964
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,359
uh for producing seed not only

965
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,880
processing but pollination control and

966
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,838
so on

967
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,240
we'll be going there thursday this week

968
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,239
again

969
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,559
here is a student who had recently

970
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,639
graduated from rit

971
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,759
an adult student who had finished

972
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,400
recently

973
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
and had further training with us and

974
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,160
two weeks ago

975
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,960
she was hired at a laboratory in

976
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,039
rochester

977
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,559
finally the distribution of the

978
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,920
germplasm

979
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:44,400
is worldwide both to the u.s

980
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,760
and to the internationally

981
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,519
35 to 40 percent of all the samples i

982
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,920
distributed are out of the u.s

983
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,559
so we do a large amount of germplasm

984
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,119
distribution outside the u.s

985
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,358
we try to do it for breeders other

986
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,720
researchers where there's a valid use

987
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:06,960
for the germplasm distribution

988
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,279
we distribute to non-profit

989
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,159
organizations other institutes and

990
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,720
universities

991
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:18,318
just the example a large amount of our

992
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:22,799
germplasm is tomato as you can see here

993
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,838
look at these totals we start 2008 35 15

994
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,839
in their

995
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,078
last year 14

996
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,400
290

997
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,400
and with sequestration

998
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,639
and not being able to fill positions

999
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,639
this has been very difficult

1000
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,078
dealing with these uh distributions

1001
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,838
uh

1002
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,880
and there's not just

1003
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:47,838
small distributions there have been

1004
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,920
we've provided south korea with whole

1005
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,119
collections of our germplasm like the

1006
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,159
whole tomato the whole onion collection

1007
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
larry

1008
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,199
a question

1009
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,838
in the last four years it

1010
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,799
has gone up like four holes

1011
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,078
yeah

1012
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,200
so what what was it like before 2008 was

1013
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,680
there i mean what

1014
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,639
it was around three to four thousand

1015
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,318
every year before 2008. so why has it

1016
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,960
grown so much been in the last four

1017
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,759
years well one thing was and we cut it

1018
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,039
out some of it was these non-research

1019
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,880
requests

1020
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,920
we were giving that to them and saying

1021
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,880
we won't be able to give it to you again

1022
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,599
but we've had a number like nunum seed

1023
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,519
has asked for our whole onion collection

1024
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,599
and whole tomato collection

1025
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,599
and i told them why do you need it now

1026
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,400
they said we're worried about access in

1027
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,200
the future i said i just can't do it

1028
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,920
you're good and so they provided me

1029
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,679
they came themselves and helped take the

1030
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,240
seed under our supervision

1031
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,719
so they came and actually did it

1032
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,719
we've been repatriating germplasm to

1033
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,199
places like south korea where they give

1034
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,358
a list of stuff they think

1035
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,879
originally came

1036
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,799
then they uh

1037
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,599
there have been companies doing

1038
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,880
large-scale screenings like onion for

1039
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,119
irish yellow spot virus resistance so

1040
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,000
these have what have increased our

1041
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,000
distributions

1042
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:22,239
some of our problems is the

1043
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,279
this germplasm is distributed freely but

1044
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,279
there are

1045
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,319
increasing numbers of non-research

1046
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,280
requests does that mean farmers

1047
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,599
we don't provide to farmers

1048
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,440
well we get a lot of gardeners

1049
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,760
and private individuals saying they're

1050
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,079
going to do research

1051
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,160
and what we've done is basically

1052
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,039
telling them where they can find

1053
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,199
seed that's more appropriate to them

1054
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,599
we used to a lot of the sites in the

1055
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,838
germplasm system used to say okay here's

1056
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,760
some of what you asked for please don't

1057
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,279
ask in the future these are where you

1058
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
can go

1059
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,119
now we've taken a very hard

1060
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,838
stand that if you're not if we if i

1061
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,640
don't consider it invalid use we send a

1062
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,960
rejection letter

1063
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,799
most people accept it

1064
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,280
uh some complain

1065
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,920
and then of those probably

1066
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,880
one out of ten who complain i'll re-look

1067
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,760
at it and give it to them

1068
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,000
other issues are our costs for shipping

1069
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,880
and vital sanitary certificates have

1070
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,880
really increased

1071
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,519
and we've been requested to provide

1072
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,400
certification as gmo

1073
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,239
genetically modified as being

1074
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,480
free of that

1075
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,879
because of national policy i cannot

1076
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,679
provide that

1077
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,039
i cannot provide a letter that says that

1078
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:51,199
we certify as gmo free i cannot provide

1079
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,960
a letter that says to the best of my

1080
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,318
knowledge there should be it should be

1081
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,960
genetic

1082
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,719
gmo free that's national policy it's out

1083
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,199
of my hands

1084
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,598
and then requirements of certification

1085
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,679
is disease and virus free

1086
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,760
because of the way we're multiplying

1087
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:12,399
stuff every year we have 400 plots a

1088
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,359
year for seed i can't do that we don't

1089
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,838
have the resources for field inspections

1090
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,358
roguing and testing

1091
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,759
it's just too much

1092
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,920
we ask them to get a research exemption

1093
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,079
if they want that

1094
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,159
and then again our intellectual property

1095
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,960
rights is always an issue with

1096
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,960
distribution

1097
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,000
so in summary we can serve

1098
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,079
regenerate

1099
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,358
characterize evaluate and distribute

1100
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,960
germplasm

1101
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,598
of our fruit and vegetable crops the

1102
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,519
degradation of environments where the

1103
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,519
centers of origin is making our

1104
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,400
collections more important

1105
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:54,000
also the lack of access to these centers

1106
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,318
of origin

1107
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,519
and centers of diversity are making the

1108
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:02,800
collections more important now

1109
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:05,920
this germplasm is you needed to maintain

1110
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,920
and improve crop

1111
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,680
tolerances and resistances

1112
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,200
we keep getting more and more crops

1113
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,838
we're asking for

1114
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,318
quality traits not just tomato but

1115
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:24,719
they've started asking for onions for

1116
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:27,759
fructans for example quercetin

1117
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,199
and we're using the gbs the molecular

1118
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,440
biologist

1119
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:35,279
and then gis

1120
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,760
