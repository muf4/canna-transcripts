1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,320
thanks for the introduction chris i also

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,558
grew up in ithaca

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,399
and was a research assistant at cornell

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,640
back in the summer of 2008

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,399
so it's been a real pleasure to be back

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,880
here again even if just over zoom

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,320
after my time at cornell i went off to

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,919
grad school at the university of

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,839
michigan as chris said

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
and while i was there i studied range

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,200
expansion dynamics of plants

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,039
in response to climate change

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,559
specifically i focused on biotic

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,719
interactions between

17
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,159
range expanding plants and herbivores

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
and pathogens

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
the core of my work was a series of

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
transplant experiments across a

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,519
latitudinal gradient

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
and in these experiments i quantified

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
how biotic and

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
abiotic processes affected plant growth

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,280
and survival

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,439
data from these field experiments gave

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,239
me a chance to study how these processes

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,960
varied across

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,640
spatial scales ranging from meters to

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
hundreds of kilometers

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,079
and to quantify how these processes

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,000
affected plant populations

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,239
i also investigated the effects of

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,680
various global change drivers on plant

35
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,239
populations using meta-analysis

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
ultimately this work was motivated by

37
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,959
the desire to both

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
understand how climate change will

39
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,919
affect these forests

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,959
and the hope that this knowledge would

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,359
inform management practices

42
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,438
these are my research themes creating

43
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,118
models of ecological processes for

44
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,919
individual plants

45
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,759
scaling to populations and landscapes

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,879
and using this information to inform

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,959
management

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,719
however it's hard to manage processes

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,599
that are occurring on time scales of

50
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,319
centuries

51
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,000
and i decided i wanted to work on a

52
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,078
plant ecology topic

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
that had more immediate relevance to

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,959
people's lives

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,479
so after my phd i began to apply these

56
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:03,519
same research themes to a new topic

57
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,039
airborne pollen in my talk today

58
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,798
i'm going to start by covering the

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
current state of affairs in airborne

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,239
pollen

61
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,280
and then move on to describe the

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,878
spacio-temporal models of airborne

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
pollen that i've created

64
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,318
by quantifying pollen production plant

65
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,680
location

66
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,199
and flowering phenology through the talk

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
i'm going to show you how i've applied

68
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,199
these same methods

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,079
to urban trees and ragweed plants in

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,318
detroit

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
to juniper trees in texas and then i'm

72
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,359
going to tell you a little bit

73
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,199
about my future research plans of

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,680
applying similar methods

75
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:40,000
to trees at continental scales

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
almost all gymnosperms and at least 10

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,719
percent of angiosperms are wind

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,040
pollinated

79
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
in temperate regions like ithaca this

80
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,479
includes most

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,719
trees and lots of important crops too

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,799
for these plants understanding airborne

83
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,598
pollen is critical for understanding

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
gene flow

85
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,799
and this is relevant to research that's

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,120
being done now at sips

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,719
for example pollination is required for

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
hemp crops that are being grown for

89
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,680
grain

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,200
whereas airborne pollen can interfere

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
with hemp being grown for cbd

92
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,759
another relevant agricultural issue is

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,239
the spread of herbicide resistance genes

94
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,158
across

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,080
landscapes similarly

96
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,079
understanding airborne pollen is

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,879
important for paleo ecologists that

98
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
reconstruct

99
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,079
plant communities using pollen grains

100
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,439
and sediment cores

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,120
or fossils pollen also

102
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,280
directly affects human health by

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
triggering allergic reactions

104
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,479
and an understanding of airborne pollen

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,318
is important in all of these examples

106
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,798
and to many examples that i haven't

107
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,399
listed

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
over the next few days i'm looking

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
forward to talking with many of you

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
about this topic and how my research

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
themes

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,400
might apply to your study systems too

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
that being said for most of today i'm

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,840
going to focus on airborne pollen

115
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,719
through the lens of allergies and human

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,239
health

117
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,239
pollen allergies are becoming

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,799
increasingly common around the world

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,438
and rising carbon dioxide concentrations

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,480
also cause plants to produce more pollen

121
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,479
and pollen that is more allergenic

122
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,879
and even though pollen allergies are

123
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,358
sometimes dismissed as just a nuisance

124
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,918
they make life miserable for millions of

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,240
americans and people around the world

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
they also have big societal consequences

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
including millions have lost

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,199
school and work days every year and can

129
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
also trigger potentially fatal asthma

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
attacks

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
most of what we know about airborne

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
pollen comes from pollen monitoring

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
stations

134
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,918
there are about 80 of these stations in

135
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,319
the united states which are run through

136
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,000
the national allergy bureau network

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,800
and each of these stations takes

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,478
integrated daily measurements

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
here's a map of these monitoring

140
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,159
stations

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,400
if we zoom into the northeast you can

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,560
see that the nearest station to ithaca

143
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,879
is in rochester about 75 miles away

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,639
the current paradigm in this field is to

145
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,079
just use data from the nearest

146
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,079
monitoring station

147
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,478
in other words it is standard practice

148
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,279
to assume that pollen concentrations in

149
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,839
ithaca

150
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,638
are the same as they are on one roof in

151
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,638
rochester

152
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,478
in fact when you see pollen

153
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,000
concentrations reported in the media

154
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,519
what you're usually getting is

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,199
yesterday's measurements

156
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,279
likely from tens of miles away from you

157
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
also while the forecasting methods that

158
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,038
are used by companies

159
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,879
are usually proprietary one of the

160
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,240
poorly kept secrets is that a lot of

161
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,639
these forecasts from

162
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
leading websites are actually based off

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,038
of allergy medication

164
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,359
sales which is not always the best proxy

165
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,800
for

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,120
airborne pollen concentrations so

167
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
even in the best case these predictions

168
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,038
of airborne pollen generally assume that

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,520
pollen is homogeneous within regions

170
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
surprisingly there's very little data on

171
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,639
how pollen concentrations

172
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,279
vary within regions one potential

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,400
explanation for why we don't know more

174
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,758
is that most plant ecologists don't know

175
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,439
much about allergies

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
and most allergists don't know much

177
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,839
about plants so i think this is kind of

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
fallen into gaps between fields a little

179
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,879
bit

180
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,559
however there's another really big

181
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,879
reason why we don't know more

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,879
and that is the the methods that are

183
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,439
used for sampling pollen

184
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,038
and traditionally two types of samplers

185
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,120
have been used the roto-rod and the

186
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,839
burkhart sampler

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,759
these samplers were designed about 70

188
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,239
years ago and haven't changed much since

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
then

190
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
they're bulky they need to be plugged

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
into ac

192
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,359
power and they also aren't cheap

193
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,318
which makes it difficult to conduct

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
these large

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,439
simultaneous measurement campaigns that

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
we need

197
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:58,319
to figure out how pollen varies

198
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,319
over relatively small spatial scales

199
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,879
one of my contributions here was making

200
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,478
an updated design of one of these pollen

201
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,560
sampler types myself

202
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,839
and i was lucky enough to get some help

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,319
from a few

204
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,159
engineering grad students on this and i

205
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,680
ended up soldering together a fleet of

206
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
these samplers

207
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,319
the designs for them are currently in

208
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
prep for submission to an open source

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,319
hardware journal

210
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,318
with these samplers i was able to

211
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,160
empirically test whether this large

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
assumption of pollen being homogeneous

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,800
within a region was true

214
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,879
next i'm going to show you some results

215
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,079
on that

216
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,598
this is a map of detroit the study area

217
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,918
for my first postdoc

218
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,478
and this map shows simultaneously

219
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,959
collected oak pollen measurements across

220
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,000
detroit the color of each of these

221
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,638
circles

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,478
indicates airborne pollen on a

223
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,120
particular day

224
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,598
so this is just one day as an example

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,079
and

226
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,680
i'd like to note that the color scale

227
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,758
here is logarithmic

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,439
and the take home message from this is

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,319
that pollen concentrations

230
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,800
do vary dramatically over relatively

231
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,598
short

232
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,598
distances

233
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,039
it also shows why using a single station

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,160
as a proxy for an entire region

235
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:19,120
doesn't work all that well in fact

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,720
measurements from that pollen station

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,519
shown in the upper right hand corner of

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
this map

239
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
they only explain about six percent of

240
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,079
the variation in oak pollen across the

241
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,519
area

242
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,439
across the season so uh and i should

243
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,519
also point out that other taxa had

244
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,559
similar results and concentrations

245
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,799
on a particular day often varied by

246
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,119
two or three orders of magnitude across

247
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,799
the city

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,639
to me this means that we've been making

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
bad assumptions about exposure to

250
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,199
airborne pollen

251
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,959
because we haven't been thinking about

252
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,278
it spatially

253
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,000
i think it's time for a paradigm shift

254
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,519
and our understanding of airborne pollen

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
in my talk today i'm going to show you

256
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,080
the benefits of transitioning from

257
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,920
a phenomenological monitoring network to

258
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
a spatial modeling approach that

259
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,958
includes the underlying ecological

260
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,320
and biological processes i think this

261
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,799
has the potential to

262
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,240
revolutionize our understanding of

263
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,240
allergenic pollen exposure

264
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,919
so in the next section of my talk i'm

265
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
going to walk you through my approach to

266
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,719
modeling airborne pollen

267
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,040
which requires answering these questions

268
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
first how much pollen does a single

269
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,519
plant produce

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
second where are the plants that are

271
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,759
releasing pollen

272
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
and third when are these plants

273
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,278
flowering

274
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
and releasing pollen now each of these

275
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,080
are basic research

276
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
questions on their own but the

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,879
combination of them leads to

278
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,360
applied solutions to real world problems

279
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,399
and in fact even though this is research

280
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
on plants

281
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,879
the health implications here are strong

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,519
enough that it was competitive for nih

283
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,919
funding

284
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,919
which supported my postdoc at u of m

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
so let's dive into pollen production my

286
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,838
goal was to be able to

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
estimate an individual tree's pollen

288
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
production as a function of its size

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but no such equations had been developed

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
for north american tree species

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,039
and the equations that had been

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,560
developed for trees elsewhere

293
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:20,480
generally used pretty coarse methods

294
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,759
i set about creating equations for

295
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,399
several tree species

296
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,399
but for most of my talk today i'm going

297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
to show you examples from oak trees

298
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,559
because they are common and produce lots

299
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
of allergenic pollen

300
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,078
at this point i'd also like to

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,320
acknowledge victoria bankowski who was

302
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,078
an

303
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
undergraduate student who worked with me

304
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,039
for two years on a couple of projects

305
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,039
including this one

306
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,120
here's an example of how i estimated

307
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,519
pollen production

308
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,200
first i selected trees of a range of

309
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,039
sizes

310
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
and then i borrowed a trick from my days

311
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,439
of assessing understory light

312
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,159
availability

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,320
and took hemispherical photos of each

314
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,319
tree's canopy

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
these photos made it easy for me to

316
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
systematically

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,560
and quantitatively estimate the number

318
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,439
of flower clusters per tree

319
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,078
i then took branch samples and counted

320
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
the number of

321
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,278
catkins per cluster and then counted the

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,600
number of anthers per catkin

323
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,439
and finally counted the number of pollen

324
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
grains per anther

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,640
i then multiplied all of these together

326
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,879
to estimate a tree's pollen production

327
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,679
so the question is how well can we

328
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,720
predict

329
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,359
pollen production based on a tree's size

330
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,000
on the x-axis here is a tree's canopy

331
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,159
area

332
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,679
and on the y-axis is the number of

333
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,199
pollen grains produced

334
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,639
in millions so let's take a look at the

335
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
results

336
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,720
the dots here are individual trees and

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,200
the lines are regressions

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
the mean is in blue and the variation

339
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,200
which is based on bootstrapping

340
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:57,919
is in gray so for red oak trees

341
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
larger trees produced more pollen and

342
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,838
they did so

343
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,679
in a predictable fashion

344
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
this held true for the other species in

345
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,039
the study too

346
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,439
and it turns out that tree size is

347
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,519
a very good predictor of pollen

348
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,279
production

349
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,519
that being said i want to take a moment

350
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,919
to focus in on something here i've

351
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
i have uh pollen production in the

352
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,879
millions but

353
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,879
it's kind of hard to get a good gut

354
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,000
sense of what a hundred million pollen

355
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,600
grains means

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
so i want to put those numbers in some

357
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
context

358
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,600
the largest white mulberry tree that i

359
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,439
measured had about 125 million anthers

360
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,879
here's an animation of a single white

361
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,760
mulberry anther releasing pollen

362
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,879
that single anther has about 50 000

363
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
pollen grains in it

364
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,958
but only it only takes as few as 15

365
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,120
pollen grains

366
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,039
per cubic meter of air for the most

367
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
sensitized people to have an allergic

368
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,639
reaction

369
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
so imagine being allergic to white

370
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,278
mulberry

371
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,839
and having hundreds of these trees in

372
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,000
your city

373
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,160
the next step in developing a model of

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,759
airborne pollen was to figure out where

375
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,240
each of these trees were now my study

376
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,399
area

377
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,799
was the city of detroit which is big and

378
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
at 360 square kilometers

379
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,159
there's no way to measure all of these

380
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
trees by hand

381
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,799
luckily we're living at a time when vast

382
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
amounts of new remote sensing data

383
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,599
are becoming available as are processing

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,799
techniques to manage it

385
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,839
and these can be applied to tasks like

386
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,919
tree

387
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,079
identification of these new data sources

388
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,039
is a company called near map which takes

389
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,759
high resolution

390
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,240
aerial images of most urban areas in the

391
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,519
us

392
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,720
a few times a year and this data set had

393
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,480
never been used for

394
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,959
tree identification i combined it

395
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
the the multi-temporal aerial images

396
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,719
from your map

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,959
with a few other data sets including

398
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,839
lidar and a street tree database

399
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,239
and used that to identify trees in

400
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,920
detroit

401
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,159
i'm going to show you a brief overview

402
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,919
of how i did this analysis

403
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,838
but if you have questions about the

404
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,599
details i'd be happy to discuss it more

405
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
in the question and answer session after

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,320
the talk

407
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,599
okay so here's an aerial image of one

408
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,519
spot in detroit

409
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,079
you can see trees houses a golf course

410
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,720
and now let's overlay that lidar data on

411
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,719
top of this

412
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
lidar provides information about the

413
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,559
three-dimensional structure

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
of things and here the the lighter

415
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,958
colors

416
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,198
the white corresponds to taller objects

417
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,799
with this information about the height

418
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:48,078
of each object

419
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,078
we can then use segmentation algorithms

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,120
to segment segment these into canopies

421
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,679
of individual trees or at least large

422
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
piece

423
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,958
pieces of a tree and that's shown by

424
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,120
these yellow polygons here

425
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,479
i then extracted various indices from

426
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,519
the aerial imagery

427
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,240
and the lidar and used that to classify

428
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,240
the trees

429
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,039
the color of each polygon here

430
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,639
corresponds to the predicted taxon of

431
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,639
that tree canopy polygon

432
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,719
this worked out great for several facts

433
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
but others i couldn't tease apart as

434
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
well

435
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,799
but even with these limitations these

436
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,758
predictions of

437
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,879
individual tree identity are incredibly

438
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
useful

439
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,720
i'd also like to note that we're on the

440
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,278
cusp of tree identification with remote

441
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
sensing

442
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,519
being operational and over the next few

443
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,239
years these data sets are going to

444
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
become

445
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,600
more and more widespread and

446
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,679
accessible now i'd like to draw your

447
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
attention to these green polygons which

448
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,719
are oak trees

449
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,560
and here's where it gets really exciting

450
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
because we know the area of each of

451
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,239
these tree canopy polygons

452
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,399
we can plug in those allometric

453
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,278
equations of pollen production

454
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,919
to predict how much pollen each of these

455
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,519
trees

456
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,000
is going to produce

457
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,720
and here's estimated pollen production

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,839
for each oak tree in this frame

459
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
now because this is done with remote

460
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480
sensing data though

461
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,198
we can scale this up so let's zoom out

462
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,600
to the whole neighborhood here

463
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,278
and this is the the university district

464
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
in detroit

465
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,559
it's an area with a lot of oak trees now

466
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,759
let's

467
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,159
zoom out even more to the whole city

468
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,278
the square on this slide is where the

469
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,399
previous slide

470
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,360
left off and here we are a map of oak

471
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
pollen production

472
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
for detroit based on pollen production

473
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,440
by

474
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,039
individual trees this is really cool and

475
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
you can just see the differences in

476
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,519
neighborhoods

477
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,639
between oak pollen production

478
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,120
but the next big question is whether

479
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,879
nearby pollen production predicts

480
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,599
airborne pollen

481
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,160
after all people have long assumed that

482
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,399
because pollen can blow long distances

483
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,360
that it usually does let's take a look

484
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
the x-axis of this figure is predicted

485
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,678
pollen production

486
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,759
around a sampling site and the y-axis is

487
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
the average concentration of airborne

488
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,759
pollen during the springtime

489
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,759
based on repeated sampling

490
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
so to answer the question of whether

491
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
there's more airborne

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,038
pollen near source plants the answer is

493
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,200
yes

494
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,440
there's definitely a strong relationship

495
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
here

496
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
this is an exciting finding because it

497
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,640
provides

498
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,079
very strong evidence that local plants

499
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,759
are driving airborne pollen

500
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,678
concentrations

501
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,279
in other words this shows that if you

502
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,679
live in a neighborhood with more

503
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,279
oak trees you're likely going to be

504
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,600
exposed to much more

505
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:03,038
oak pollen i'd also suggest that if

506
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,639
you're allergic to oak trees you

507
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,000
shouldn't be planting one in your front

508
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
yard

509
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,240
now this is common sense but we haven't

510
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,160
had a scientific

511
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,079
basis to justify that before and

512
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
and so this finding is really relevant

513
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,199
for large landowners like municipal

514
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
governments

515
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,440
and points to the possibility of being

516
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,798
able to intentionally create

517
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,840
lower allergen landscapes

518
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,079
so my major conclusion here is that

519
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,119
we should be including allergenic pollen

520
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,599
production as

521
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,558
one criterion in our tree selection

522
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,399
decisions

523
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,319
because the choices that we're making

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
about what trees we plant

525
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:46,079
it affects pollen exposure for the

526
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,079
people that live nearby

527
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,720
now one concern is that this finding

528
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,879
could be interpreted

529
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,319
as an argument for having fewer trees in

530
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
cities

531
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,798
i have two responses to this first one

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,520
of the best management options

533
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,400
is to just plant different trees and

534
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,119
specifically

535
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,360
uh we could plant cultivars that produce

536
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,759
less pollen

537
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,798
the other response that i have is that

538
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,558
allergenic pollen

539
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,558
it's just one of the many ways in which

540
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,960
we're interacting with trees

541
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,038
and in almost all circumstances the

542
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,519
ecosystem services provided by

543
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,319
trees will dramatically outweigh the

544
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,400
ecosystem

545
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:29,038
disservices of allergenic pollen

546
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
i'd also like to point out that the same

547
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,558
framework that i'm using

548
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,240
understanding processes for individual

549
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,399
plants scaling them

550
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,679
up and using that information to inform

551
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
management we can

552
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,519
also apply this to some of those

553
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,519
ecosystem services that these trees are

554
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,359
providing

555
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,400
so i'm going to take you on a brief

556
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,038
detour and show you shade as an example

557
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
of this

558
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,640
so take this tree here in austin

559
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,038
and then look at it from above outlined

560
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
in blue

561
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,599
to understand the shade provided by this

562
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
tree we can create a mechanistic model

563
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,079
that takes into account the height of

564
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
that tree

565
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,439
and the angle of the sun on any

566
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,440
particular day of the year

567
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,440
here's an animation of mottled shade

568
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,759
throughout the day

569
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,038
you can see the trajectory of the sun

570
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,279
across the sky

571
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,839
and see how these trees shade different

572
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,839
buildings

573
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
and again since this is done with remote

574
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,600
sensing data it gives us

575
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,319
gives us a way to scale from individual

576
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,199
plants

577
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,240
to landscapes and i have to say having

578
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,960
just lived through

579
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,798
my first austin summer i have a deep

580
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
appreciation for the shade these

581
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,879
trees provide but let's get back to

582
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,519
pollen and detroit

583
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,799
so we've now covered plant location and

584
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,720
pollen production

585
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,319
so let's talk about the other process

586
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,798
that we need to predict

587
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,439
pollen emissions which is the timing of

588
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,440
flowering

589
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
we know that temperature determines

590
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,440
flowering time and we also know that

591
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,080
urban heat islands and temperature

592
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,880
gradients

593
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,798
in cities are common i therefore

594
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
hypothesize that there would also be

595
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,759
differences in flowering time

596
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,759
within detroit to assess the

597
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,240
relationships between temperature

598
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,158
flowering time an airborne pollen i

599
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,159
conducted a field study in detroit

600
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,960
where i measured flowering time for a

601
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,240
bunch of trees in the city

602
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,038
and i measured these flowering phenology

603
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,880
of over 100 trees and nine different

604
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,720
neighborhoods and those neighborhoods

605
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,400
are shown with the hollow symbols

606
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,600
on this map here i then compared

607
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,640
flowering time

608
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,959
with temperature during the early spring

609
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
specifically land surface temperature

610
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,120
which comes from

611
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,119
which i and

612
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,199
to get that land surface temperature i

613
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,119
use data from the modis sensor

614
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
on the terra and aqua satellites

615
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,440
here are the results for whether

616
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,839
temperature explains flowering

617
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,519
temperature is on the x-axis and the

618
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,158
timing of flowering is on the y-axis

619
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,798
each of these small symbols is a single

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
tree

621
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,720
and the large symbols are site averages

622
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,759
and as you can see the association is

623
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,038
very strong

624
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,879
and warmer places flower earlier

625
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
we can then combine our knowledge of

626
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,320
this relationship

627
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,400
with remote sensing based measurements

628
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,439
of temperature to predict the timing of

629
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,960
flowering across the entire metro area

630
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,679
so next i'm going to show you an

631
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,279
animation of predicted flowering dates

632
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,280
for oak trees in detroit

633
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,240
each of these frames is a day and

634
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,520
flowering is indicated by the yellower

635
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,919
colors

636
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,440
so you can see that wave of flowering

637
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,840
moving from the south

638
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,840
to cooler areas in the north

639
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,120
then by the middle of may you can see

640
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:09,839
trees

641
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,839
have basically finished flowering

642
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,319
i've now shown you data on the various

643
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,960
processes that determine

644
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,119
um airborne pollen concentrations

645
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,519
including how much pollen is released

646
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,959
where pollen is released from and when

647
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,639
that poem is released

648
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,000
we can then combine all of these

649
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
different processes

650
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,839
to predict pollen release over both time

651
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
and space

652
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,798
and next i'm going to show you an

653
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,798
animation that puts all of this

654
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,558
together and this

655
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,798
is predicted pollen release for oak

656
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:45,038
trees in detroit in the spring of 2017.

657
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,359
and here you can see the interplay of

658
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,079
both those spatial features of where oak

659
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,038
trees are

660
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,199
and how much pollen they're releasing as

661
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,480
well as the temporal dynamics

662
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,679
caused by temperature differences across

663
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,679
the city of detroit

664
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,359
now the big question though is whether

665
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,199
this model predicts airborne pollen

666
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:12,000
at particular times and places

667
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
and i'm excited to say that when i

668
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,640
compared

669
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,359
this model of pollen release with

670
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
airborne

671
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:23,599
pollen from the that data set that i

672
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,960
collected with the pollen samplers

673
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,439
this model explained almost half

674
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,159
of the variation in airborne pollen

675
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,400
concentrations for oak trees

676
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
i want to emphasize that this is about

677
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,720
nine times better

678
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,240
than simply using pollen measurements

679
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,759
from the nearest pollen monitoring

680
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
station as a proxy

681
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,839
which has been the standard practice in

682
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,480
this field at least as it applies to

683
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,480
allergies

684
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,000
allergists have long said that pollen is

685
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
everywhere and you can't avoid it

686
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
but these results say otherwise there

687
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,880
are real pollen hot spots

688
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,000
and they are also predictable so imagine

689
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,480
having this extra

690
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,599
resolution and accuracy in your pollen

691
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,159
forecast

692
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,199
i think it offers up all sorts of

693
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,960
possibilities

694
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,880
including ways for people to either

695
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,640
avoid pollen hot spots

696
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,278
or to take their medication ahead of

697
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,559
time so it reaches full efficacy

698
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,558
before they're exposed

699
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:26,798
these types of improvements could

700
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,600
really improve quality of life for many

701
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,038
people

702
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,678
uh but for vulnerable people including

703
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,480
those with

704
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,200
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary

705
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
disorder

706
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
this is a really big deal

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
you may be wondering about the effect of

708
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,558
wind

709
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,000
and atmospheric dispersion on airborne

710
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,200
pollen concentrations

711
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,319
and i can say it's very big and it

712
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,400
should be included here uh this these

713
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,319
models of pollen release will pair

714
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
nicely with atmospheric dispersion

715
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,000
modeling

716
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,679
and i've collected some of the the data

717
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,200
needed to calibrate these models

718
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,200
but i haven't created them yet

719
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,798
i also expect that the same framework

720
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
could also be applied to fungal spores

721
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,278
which would have applications

722
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
not just an allergy but also in

723
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,400
agricultural

724
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,079
settings so far i've shown you how my

725
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,080
framework works for trees

726
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,079
and in my next example i'm going to turn

727
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,439
towards ragweed which is an early

728
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,599
successional species

729
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,919
that releases vast amounts of allergenic

730
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,599
pollen

731
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,679
and to begin i'd like to acknowledge

732
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,319
tiffany carey who is a mentee of mine

733
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,919
starting in 2010 when we first started a

734
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,960
pollen project together

735
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,120
and i'm really proud of the

736
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
contributions that tiffany made

737
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,558
to this work and she's now back in

738
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,240
detroit again

739
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,599
working with the national wildlife

740
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,640
federation on

741
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,798
environmental and social issues there

742
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
one of the things that tiffany and i and

743
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,639
i noticed pretty early on

744
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,918
was that there was far more ragweed and

745
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,919
vacant lots in detroit

746
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,919
the city has demolished about 20 000

747
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,599
vacant structures since 2014

748
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
and here's a little chrono sequence of

749
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,319
what that looks like so here's

750
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,399
a building that is slated for demolition

751
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,918
and here's the exposed soil

752
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,678
the next spring by the fall

753
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,240
you can see little bits of green in the

754
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,440
lot and that is exactly the habitat

755
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
where ragweed thrives

756
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,240
i quantified this habitat across the

757
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,599
city of detroit using remote sensing

758
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,640
data and linked it with

759
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,599
field surveys in order to create a

760
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,759
map of pollen production across the city

761
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,759
of detroit which i'm showing to you here

762
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,798
this approach worked pretty well and i'd

763
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
also think that similar methods could be

764
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:56,639
used for understanding weed populations

765
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,399
across agricultural landscapes

766
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
one of our findings was that some

767
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,839
neighborhoods had

768
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,000
lots and lots of ragweed and others had

769
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,158
almost none

770
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
the neighborhoods that have many vacant

771
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
lots and a lot of ragweed tend to be

772
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,200
poorer

773
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,319
and in fact you can just see the spatial

774
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,558
correlation between

775
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,960
ragweed pollen production and the

776
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,398
percent of detroiters living in poverty

777
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,000
which is shown in this bottom map

778
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,759
the people living in poorer

779
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,640
neighborhoods also tend to have

780
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,319
less access to health care and higher

781
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
allergy and asthma rates

782
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,480
so i think this is an example where

783
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,319
ragweed pollen exposure

784
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,159
is actually an environmental justice

785
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,319
issue too

786
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,240
i'd like to take a moment to talk about

787
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,798
this statistic that i've just put on the

788
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,720
screen

789
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,119
that black people in detroit are twice

790
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,519
as likely to be hospitalized for asthma

791
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,199
as white people in detroit now this

792
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,079
isn't the type of statistic that we

793
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
usually mention

794
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,240
in plant ecology talks but i think it's

795
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,558
relevant here

796
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
because interactions with plants could

797
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:02,319
be making a certain amount

798
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,319
of contribution to this situation

799
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,199
luckily in this particular case there

800
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,119
are some simple management

801
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,558
recommendations for vacant lots and in

802
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,599
particular it turns out

803
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,720
that you if you either mow regularly the

804
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,719
ragweed goes away

805
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
or if you leave the lot on its own

806
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,558
succession happens and ragweed is out

807
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,399
competed

808
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,000
so i've now shown you examples of how

809
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,599
i've quantified the ecological

810
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,319
processes really relating to pollen

811
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,798
release

812
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,398
and how i've scaled this up to the

813
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,278
municipal level for both

814
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,079
oak trees and ragweed but these are just

815
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,640
predictions

816
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,278
in a single city and so the next thing

817
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,759
to do

818
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,319
is to work to scale this up to even

819
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,359
larger

820
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,000
areas and that is what i'm doing as a

821
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,798
postdoc

822
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
at the university of texas my research

823
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,200
here

824
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,600
is on cedar fever which is actually

825
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,519
allergies caused by juniper pollen

826
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,278
still this is one of the most important

827
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,158
allergenic pollen producing plants in

828
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,079
the u.s

829
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,240
and part because of how much pollen it

830
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,960
releases

831
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,079
here's a branch of a juniper tree

832
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,360
releasing pollen in january

833
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,639
a really big juniper tree of the species

834
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:19,278
can release as many as

835
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,278
half a trillion pollen grains each year

836
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,759
anecdotally we know that cedar fever has

837
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,640
big effects on respiratory health in

838
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,278
texas

839
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
but that's never been quantified right

840
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,159
now i'm working on an epidemiological

841
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,599
analysis

842
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,840
to compare airborne pollen

843
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,519
concentrations with emergency department

844
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,319
visits for asthma

845
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,558
and the the preliminary results from

846
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,918
this study are showing that cedar fever

847
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:47,038
is conservatively associated with about

848
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,559
5000 extra emergency department visits

849
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,679
each year

850
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,038
since only the most extreme cases result

851
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,360
in ed visits the true effects of

852
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:01,119
cedar fever on quality of life for

853
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,119
texans is astronomical

854
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,599
the way i'm going about working on this

855
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,600
problem

856
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,879
is to create similar uh models to what i

857
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,959
did in detroit

858
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
and to do so i'm taking the same

859
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,200
approach i'm figuring out how much

860
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,319
pollen individual trees produce

861
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,558
figuring out how where these trees are

862
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:26,240
and when they release pollen and then

863
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,240
using dispersion modeling

864
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,480
and the goal of this is to create

865
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,038
near-term forecasts

866
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,440
and alerts for cedar fever sufferers in

867
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,440
texas

868
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,079
now to make this work at the state level

869
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,678
i've had to do something different

870
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,038
because i can't drive all around the

871
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
state to collect these measurements

872
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,720
myself

873
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,398
so i started a citizen science project

874
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,000
called pollen trackers

875
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,719
through a collaboration with the

876
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,119
national phenology network

877
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,120
volunteers on this project are helping

878
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,239
to collect those measurements upon

879
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,319
release by junipers across texas and we

880
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,679
are just about to go into our second

881
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,678
field season next month

882
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,839
the goal of my work is to develop

883
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,960
process-based models of airborne pollen

884
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,519
at the continental scale models like

885
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,079
this

886
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,519
would fill gaps in our understanding of

887
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,839
both gene flow

888
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
and of how much pollen people are

889
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,678
exposed to

890
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,640
forecasts from this model would also be

891
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,840
really useful for people to both reduce

892
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,600
their own exposure

893
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:36,319
and to better manage their medications

894
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,199
so there are a lot of potential benefits

895
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,278
for having

896
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,798
continental scale models of airborne

897
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,960
pollen and

898
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,879
it would also help us to to do things

899
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,079
like understand the role

900
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,760
of local pollen production versus

901
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:54,480
long-distance dispersal of pollen

902
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,240
this would have applications not just in

903
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
the allergy world but it would also be

904
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,839
really important for understanding gene

905
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,398
flow

906
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,038
of course creating a continental scale

907
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,479
model

908
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:08,398
is an ambitious goal and

909
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
so i've decided to break this up into

910
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,479
several distinct research projects

911
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,839
the first of these projects is

912
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,319
understanding where

913
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,720
trees are and how much pollen they

914
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,918
produce

915
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,759
this is a big task but i think that it's

916
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,480
feasible to do this

917
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,679
the way i propose approaching it is by

918
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
combining data

919
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,240
on what trees are where from the forest

920
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
inventory and analysis data set

921
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,038
which now uh in addition to including

922
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,919
forested plots it also includes data on

923
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,919
urban trees

924
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,038
this data set of tree locations and

925
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,959
abundance

926
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,558
could be combined with remote sensing

927
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,840
data and in particular

928
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:59,278
it could be combined with imagery from

929
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:03,038
satellites like landsat as well as with

930
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,038
lidar from jedi which is

931
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:10,239
which is another potentially very useful

932
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,240
resource for this project

933
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,679
these estimates of tree abundance could

934
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,398
then be combined with allometric

935
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,358
equations

936
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,358
of pollen production

937
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,720
i have some ideas about how we could do

938
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,839
a better job

939
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:29,678
of making allometric equations

940
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:32,078
uh faster and more efficiently

941
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,398
and i think a great place to

942
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,720
parameterize some of those equations

943
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,159
would be are not forest and i think it's

944
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,598
also going to be important here to

945
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,519
include some of the traditional

946
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,519
plant ecology processes that

947
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,838
are also going to affect pollen

948
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,838
production so things like competition

949
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,078
there are a bunch of applications for

950
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,679
these data products

951
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
both for pollen but also for

952
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,000
understanding other ecosystem services

953
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,480
and disservices

954
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,639
including things like say the spread of

955
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,920
tree pests and pathogens

956
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,920
across the u.s

957
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,640
i think that nasa would be a good

958
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,759
potential funding source for this

959
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,358
project

960
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,240
specifically through the earth science

961
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,239
research program

962
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
in order to create continental scale

963
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,838
models of pollen

964
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,358
we also need to create continental scale

965
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:32,639
models of flowering time

966
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,279
to create this i propose uh doing a few

967
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,759
things

968
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,119
first expanding my current citizen

969
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,400
science project with the national

970
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,599
phenology network

971
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,519
and they're excited about this

972
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,519
possibility too

973
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,719
we could also get observations of

974
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,119
flowering time from

975
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,118
neon

976
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,480
another possibility is to

977
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,838
to use some new pawn monitoring devices

978
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,559
that i have

979
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,440
been piloting here in texas and these

980
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,239
devices

981
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
let me pull one out

982
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,639
these devices allow you to uh it

983
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,838
basically

984
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:15,519
is a little arduino

985
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:18,000
motor which can be timed to spin up

986
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,358
a acrylic plate at a certain rate and

987
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
these can be placed underneath

988
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,440
trees and you can change the timing of

989
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,559
this so you can get

990
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,599
a very fine resolution estimates of

991
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,960
pollen release

992
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,320
so i right now i'm piloting the idea of

993
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,880
sending these devices out to people in

994
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,480
my pawn trackers program so that they

995
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
can both

996
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,679
corroborate the data that they are

997
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,598
collecting because let's be real

998
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,199
citizen science is messy but more

999
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,559
importantly than that

1000
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:52,838
they could augment it by having a finer

1001
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:54,400
temporal understanding of when pollen is

1002
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,199
released

1003
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
these observations of flowering time

1004
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,799
could then

1005
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,880
be combined with granular climate data

1006
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,680
and the combination of these things

1007
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,920
could be used to create flowering models

1008
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,519
these could then be these flowering

1009
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,200
models

1010
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,239
could potentially use close to real-time

1011
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,199
data

1012
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,159
sources in order to create near-term

1013
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,960
forecasts

1014
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,960
of flowering

1015
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,598
better and more accessible models of

1016
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,719
flowering time would be useful for

1017
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,559
many purposes besides allergies too

1018
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:40,879
and let's see so one example is the risk

1019
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:43,199
of frost damage to flowers

1020
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
i worked a little bit on this project in

1021
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,719
graduate school

1022
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,400
and i found and one of the things that

1023
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,959
is clear in the literature is that

1024
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,559
climate change is increasing the risk of

1025
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,960
frost damage to flowers

1026
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:00,078
and in fact in ithaca this year there

1027
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,358
was snow on the ground on may 9th

1028
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,359
so having a better sense of when

1029
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,440
things are flowering could be really

1030
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:10,400
useful for understanding and

1031
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,320
responding to frost risk and this i

1032
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,838
think would be especially relevant

1033
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,280
in orchards this project

1034
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,000
would likely be a good fit with nsf and

1035
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
particularly with the division of

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,519
environmental biology

1037
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,519
that funded my graduate work

1038
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,240
ultimately one of the major

1039
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,159
justifications of my research

1040
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,439
is to better understand how pollen

1041
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,838
affects human health

1042
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,599
so that we can do something about that

1043
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,000
one of the projects i'm really excited

1044
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,640
about

1045
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,679
is combining high resolution pollen

1046
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,559
exposure data

1047
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,519
with high resolution asthma exacerbation

1048
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,279
data

1049
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,358
the group that's doing this best right

1050
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,359
now is a company called propeller health

1051
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,319
which uses smart inhalers

1052
00:38:53,358 --> 00:39:00,159
that provide information on the time and

1053
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,519
location of each asthma inhaler usage

1054
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,838
i've discussed combining our data

1055
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,119
with them and we think there's a lot of

1056
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,239
potential

1057
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,280
to use this information both the

1058
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,118
fine-grained

1059
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,720
pollen exposure estimates with the

1060
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,559
fine-grained asthma exacerbation data

1061
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:24,000
to potentially create individualized

1062
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:26,719
dose response curves for people

1063
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,719
this also opens up the possibility of

1064
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:32,000
personalized forecasts

1065
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:35,358
and propeller health this company

1066
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,119
they already help users to manage their

1067
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,159
asthma so there's a clear

1068
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,358
avenue for using these estimates

1069
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:46,000
of airborne pollen concentrations

1070
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,759
to change how people are managing

1071
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,599
allergic diseases including asthma

1072
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,880
i think a really good place to work on

1073
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,720
this project would be new york city

1074
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
in part because there are a lot of

1075
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,519
people with allergies there and a lot of

1076
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,240
good sources

1077
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,079
of uh data that i would need to create

1078
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,679
models of airborne pollen there

1079
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,359
but also because i think there's a lot

1080
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,838
of potential to

1081
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,880
collaborate with physicians at while

1082
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,880
cornell medicine

1083
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,160
having these types of personalized

1084
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
forecasts and don'ts

1085
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,719
and dose response curves would be a

1086
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,598
game-changing project from an allergies

1087
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,799
perspective

1088
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,559
and i think this would be very

1089
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,920
competitive for funding from the

1090
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,279
national institute of

1091
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
environmental health sciences

1092
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,439
these research topics that i've been

1093
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,599
talking about

1094
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,800
there's a multitude of little projects

1095
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,039
within them

1096
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,920
that would be excellent projects for

1097
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,838
graduate and undergraduate students

1098
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,358
i look forward to working with students

1099
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,119
on this research in the future

1100
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,639
and i also think that some of these

1101
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,800
topics

1102
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,000
could apply well to both existing

1103
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,720
classes at sips

1104
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,760
and to new potential classes too such as

1105
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,598
a

1106
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,240
class on the links between plants and

1107
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,240
human health

1108
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:06,559
and since chris mentioned it this photo

1109
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,078
here is actually from the the class as

1110
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,078
she mentioned

1111
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,760
this new intro to ecology field class

1112
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,480
that had about a hundred master's

1113
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,440
students in it in that class we used

1114
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,440
active and inquiry-based pedagogy and

1115
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,838
those are approaches that i hope to use

1116
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,358
and

1117
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:28,400
teaching in the future as well

1118
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,719
10 my talk i have two conclusions first

1119
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
that process-based approaches offer an

1120
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,199
effective framework

1121
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,318
for modeling airborne pollen my second

1122
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,239
conclusion

1123
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,079
is that the combination of these

1124
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,639
research themes

1125
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,240
are a very useful toolkit and today i've

1126
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,239
told you about how i've applied them in

1127
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,078
a few ways in my own study system

1128
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,919
but i'm also excited to see how my

1129
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,680
methods could be used to

1130
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,519
answer questions in other systems

1131
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,519
including farms and orchards

1132
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,599
so over the next couple of days i'm

1133
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,079
really excited to chat with you all

1134
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,800
about ideas like this and also about the

1135
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
potential for

1136
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,599
collaboration in the future so with that

1137
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,119
i'd like to acknowledge these

1138
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,039
institutions for their financial support

1139
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,200
and i'd also like to thank some of the

1140
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,079
many people who contributed to this

1141
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:19,118
research

1142
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,119
both at the university of michigan and

1143
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
now at the university of texas at austin

1144
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:31,039
so with that i would be happy to take

1145
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,119
your questions

1146
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:38,159
thank you all right thank you dan

1147
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,200
really appreciated that uh

1148
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:44,559
are there questions for dan

1149
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:47,519
you're welcome to unmute

1150
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,358
or put them in the chat or i'm trying to

1151
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,119
open up all my windows here

1152
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,519
uh raise your hand we have so many

1153
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,519
options

1154
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,719
nina do you have a question yeah hi dan

1155
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
uh how you doing thanks for the

1156
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,199
presentation um

1157
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,159
i just wondered about you know obviously

1158
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,118
pollen does

1159
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,159
cause allergies and cause reactions but

1160
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,559
uh

1161
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,598
you know is there a possibility of

1162
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,239
looking at this and

1163
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,039
as a control group in a forested area as

1164
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,439
opposed to an

1165
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,920
urban tree area i would imagine to be

1166
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,440
more trees in a more forested area than

1167
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,599
one

1168
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,880
in an urban area and i just wondered if

1169
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,000
you looked at

1170
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,559
sort of a control group of trees

1171
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,358
yeah i think that's a really interesting

1172
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,719
point

1173
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:38,559
um i think there's a couple of

1174
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,118
reasons why i've focused in on urban

1175
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,000
trees

1176
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,960
specifically that we interact the most

1177
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,159
with the trees

1178
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,280
that are closest to us and those

1179
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,440
and there's also so there's so the the

1180
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,400
incremental effect of an individual tree

1181
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,599
in a city

1182
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,639
is much stronger on health than that of

1183
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,800
a tree in a forest

1184
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,639
i think there are a bunch of really cool

1185
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,318
questions that we can answer using these

1186
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,519
same approaches for

1187
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,039
um for more rural forests too though and

1188
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,000
i think

1189
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,159
there though one of the more interesting

1190
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,559
sets of questions is about gene flow

1191
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,399
but i think the same approaches could

1192
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,119
could be used for that

1193
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,079
um when it comes to allergies there's

1194
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,119
also the

1195
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,400
there's this thing where people who live

1196
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,039
in rural areas

1197
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,280
also tend to develop fewer allergies

1198
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,679
compared to people living in cities

1199
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,400
uh so that is another reason to focus

1200
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,719
more on

1201
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,200
actually that's a another issue that

1202
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,279
there are other aspects of urban life

1203
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,078
that cause allergies than

1204
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,640
pollen you know basically automobile

1205
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,280
exhausts hydrocarbons i mean

1206
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,679
that's a big factor and that's not

1207
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,720
really factored in with your model

1208
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,358
and i wondered if you had some

1209
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,239
response to that yeah certainly that's a

1210
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,759
great question

1211
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,959
and so it's not factored into my model

1212
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
of pollen exposure

1213
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,318
but it is factored into epidemiological

1214
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,318
analyses

1215
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,358
and so that's where we need to do things

1216
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,880
like uh

1217
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,880
figure out uh the effect of various air

1218
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,358
pollutants including particulate matter

1219
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,559
for example and ozone which interacts a

1220
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,639
little bit with pollen

1221
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:23,920
uh and that's also where we need to

1222
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,559
do things like understand the effects of

1223
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,599
say viruses on emergency department

1224
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,279
visits just

1225
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,880
to reference the epidemiological

1226
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,079
analysis that i'm doing now

1227
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,519
so all of those things are important and

1228
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,039
will affect uh the proportion of

1229
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:44,318
some health outcome that is attributable

1230
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:47,519
to pollen specifically because

1231
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:51,119
trees also uh reduce

1232
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:54,880
particulates in areas i mean they do

1233
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,039
uh particulates to land on leaves and uh

1234
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,000
are so the particulates in the air tend

1235
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,279
to be less

1236
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,559
where there are trees so there's a lot

1237
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,200
of different

1238
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,078
competing issues here and it's i wonder

1239
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,358
if

1240
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,400
pollen alone is the major issue in terms

1241
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,838
of asthma

1242
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,800
yeah i appreciate the pushback here and

1243
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,039
i think it's

1244
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
what you're making are very good points

1245
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,440
and

1246
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,960
however just because there are other

1247
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,079
issues doesn't mean we shouldn't

1248
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,400
understand

1249
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,000
allergenic pollen and moreover these

1250
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,440
same approaches are really

1251
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,119
useful for doing things like

1252
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,519
understanding how

1253
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,318
much particulate matter these trees can

1254
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,358
filter out

1255
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,920
so i think that these are great points

1256
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,759
and i'd

1257
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,119
i'd be happy to go through it more with

1258
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,240
you because i think

1259
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,119
pollen is just one issue and ultimately

1260
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,358
we need to weigh

1261
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,760
both the ecosystem services and the

1262
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,559
ecosystem disservices that these trees

1263
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,079
are providing

1264
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,519
and that is ultimately what should

1265
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,760
govern our decisions about tree

1266
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:59,119
selection

1267
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:02,160
josh you had your hand raised

1268
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,760
yeah thanks sir great talk dan so

1269
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,279
in the beginning of your presentation

1270
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,119
you mentioned that um

1271
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
i think you said poland was becoming

1272
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,960
more allergenic

1273
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:15,838
do you mean on a per pollen grain basis

1274
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,838
or contextually in the context of other

1275
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,519
environmental components

1276
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:26,159
well i'm afraid it's both unfortunately

1277
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:29,358
uh yeah so i we have some good

1278
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,318
lab experiments that show that plants

1279
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:33,358
grown and higher

1280
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:35,920
carbon dioxide concentrations produce

1281
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,960
pollen grains that are on a per pollen

1282
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,000
grain unit

1283
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,599
more allergenic and so

1284
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,719
a lot of that work has been done on

1285
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,760
ragweed and

1286
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,719
yeah it's so yeah it's on a per

1287
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,280
pond grain basis so to kind of continue

1288
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,759
that

1289
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,880
line of thought i guess many many

1290
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,640
secreted

1291
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,160
cell wall proteins in pollen are

1292
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,598
allergens and

1293
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,318
is anybody looking at that looking at

1294
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,359
the the allergenic profiles of syllable

1295
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,920
protein

1296
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,440
clusters yeah i think there's a little

1297
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,280
bit of work being done on that

1298
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,079
um i would have to to look in my uh

1299
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,640
my literature folder and see exactly

1300
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,519
what

1301
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,118
is being done there um it's it's

1302
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,318
certainly something which is

1303
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:26,160
of interest to a lot of people um

1304
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,039
and yeah so i'll look a little bit more

1305
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,519
at my papers

1306
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,558
and and then give you a better answer in

1307
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,358
our one-on-one meeting

1308
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,800
you'll be too lazy thanks there's a

1309
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,358
question in chat on pollen morphology

1310
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
yeah that was me um yeah i really liked

1311
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,279
your your talk and i really want to say

1312
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,118
that i like the use of arduino

1313
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,400
uh to measure pollen released i think

1314
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,039
that's really cool

1315
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,559
um but i had a question about whether or

1316
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,519
not you're incorporating pollen

1317
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,480
morphology

1318
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:56,400
to inform like your flowering models and

1319
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,519
the only reason i asked is because i'm

1320
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
not 100

1321
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:04,719
sure about pollen grains and oak

1322
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,000
across oak species i would i would go

1323
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,159
out on a limb here and

1324
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,599
like ask you do you know like they have

1325
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,199
like different

1326
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,599
morphologies across um species of oak

1327
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,679
and maybe if that's something

1328
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,240
that can affect like whether or not

1329
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:24,639
they're allergenic

1330
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:28,239
yeah oh that's an excellent question and

1331
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,719
so i have a couple of responses first of

1332
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,838
all

1333
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,558
uh oak pollen grains generally look

1334
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,440
fairly similar and so the standard

1335
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,280
practice

1336
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,480
in the field of um aerobiology

1337
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,079
is not it's not to even try and

1338
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,760
identify what pollen grain comes from

1339
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,359
red oak versus from white oak or

1340
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
something like that because you can't do

1341
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,598
it reliably

1342
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,599
that being said there are

1343
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:01,359
differences in say the allergenicity

1344
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,119
of different closely related species

1345
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,519
and so even if it's not something that

1346
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,519
we can just see

1347
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:10,960
morphologically just

1348
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:14,880
using a microscope it can have important

1349
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:18,079
consequences for allergies

1350
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,079
does that answer your question

1351
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,318
so when you it kind of gets at it like

1352
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,280
when you mean like

1353
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,679
um i guess characteristics of

1354
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,960
allergenicity are you referring to like

1355
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,480
the shape

1356
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,599
of like the pollen grain i'm referring

1357
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,559
more to what's inside the pollen grain

1358
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
and a lot of them and so there are a

1359
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,680
variety

1360
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,598
of proteins inside of pollen grains and

1361
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:48,558
substances which

1362
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:52,960
trigger allergic reactions and and so

1363
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,960
those can vary a little bit

1364
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,960
it is easier to quantify the variation

1365
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,838
in the the cellular content and

1366
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,639
specifically

1367
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,719
and the the allergic reactions that uh

1368
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,838
the contents of a pollen grain

1369
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,558
produce than it is to say that hey like

1370
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,519
there's a

1371
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,960
slightly like thicker exon on this

1372
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,239
pollen grain than that one

1373
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,800
something like that so it's more about

1374
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:19,358
the the

1375
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,640
the protein composition than it is about

1376
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,039
the shape

1377
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:23,759
um however shape can be important for

1378
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,358
things like

1379
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,240
um how easy how easily a pollen grain

1380
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,000
bursts and releases all of that stuff

1381
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,759
into the air which is a really

1382
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,039
uh important part of this whole story

1383
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
that i haven't had a chance to talk

1384
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,558
about today

1385
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,039
yeah i was just kind of thinking about

1386
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,599
um if like for instance like the x sign

1387
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,400
is

1388
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,880
thicker on one pollen grain uh versus

1389
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,880
like

1390
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,838
the rest of the lot then it would

1391
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,599
potentially disperse

1392
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:54,880
differently

1393
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,160
yeah entirely um and that i think

1394
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,318
is something that we'll need to do a

1395
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,159
little bit more of taking into account

1396
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,199
when it comes to dispersion modeling

1397
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,480
and things like the amount of water that

1398
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,679
a pollen grain picks up

1399
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,559
is pretty important there oh yeah so

1400
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,159
that's a

1401
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,200
great point cool thanks i really enjoyed

1402
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,039
your talk

1403
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,279
thank you there are a bunch of questions

1404
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,159
here um from a plant but fellow plant

1405
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,880
pathologist

1406
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,000
uh interactions between pollen and

1407
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,920
fungal spores

1408
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,480
as many fungal spores are also

1409
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,519
allergenic

1410
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:33,280
do your marks take into account yeah

1411
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:35,039
yeah totally and i think so

1412
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,400
you may have been a little surprised by

1413
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,558
how little we know

1414
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,559
about airborne pollen you would be even

1415
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,440
more surprised by how little

1416
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,440
the allergy community knows about uh

1417
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,838
airborne fungal spores

1418
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,720
they are smaller they're much harder to

1419
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,679
identify

1420
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,639
just with a microscope and so we know a

1421
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,679
lot less

1422
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,440
about that that being said i i think

1423
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,759
that there might be some possibilities

1424
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,519
for

1425
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,800
using the framework that i've done here

1426
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,400
like figuring out

1427
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,160
source strength and the number of

1428
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,160
particulates released i think there

1429
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,440
might be some potential to do that with

1430
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,239
fungal spores too um

1431
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,280
and i should also mention that yeah

1432
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,919
fungal spores

1433
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,040
are really important to allergies too um

1434
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,079
they generally

1435
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:24,558
are there's a few national allergy

1436
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,000
bureau stations that measure them that

1437
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,559
measure fungal spores

1438
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,920
but it's not as common to include that

1439
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,480
in this type of analysis

1440
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,318
and david rossiter asks if you notice

1441
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,358
differential wind effects in the detroit

1442
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,279
study

1443
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,719
he noticed cooler temperatures just

1444
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,440
inland from

1445
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,000
lake saint claire and could that be a

1446
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,000
wind effect

1447
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:54,079
yeah yeah i've wondered a lot about uh

1448
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:57,599
the effects of wind there myself um

1449
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,839
i i think that it's likely that

1450
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,880
some of the the distance from water is

1451
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,558
affecting things

1452
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,880
like temperature um but that being said

1453
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:13,359
um if if things like wind

1454
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:16,480
are something of uh

1455
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:20,239
can are adding extra

1456
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,719
variation once we include that

1457
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:23,759
in our models then these models are just

1458
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,558
going to improve

1459
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,040
and so i think that's an area which i

1460
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,160
would

1461
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,199
love to to add more in on because it's

1462
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,358
just going to

1463
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,519
allow me to make better predictions of

1464
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:38,400
airborne pollen once we do things like

1465
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,519
incorporate variation in wind across the

1466
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,440
city

1467
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,199
as well as you know like which direction

1468
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,559
the wind is blowing and how strong and

1469
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,598
that all that stuff too and somewhat

1470
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,798
related chelsea

1471
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,760
asks uh uh can you use your methods to

1472
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,199
track pollen

1473
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,799
for plants that are not wind pollinated

1474
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:02,239
oh yeah it's a really fun uh question

1475
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:05,440
so right now my co-advisor is shaolin

1476
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:08,318
who and all of her work is on

1477
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,280
insect pollinated plants and so i think

1478
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:12,318
one of the really

1479
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,400
cool topics here is could we

1480
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,279
use some of these same methods to figure

1481
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,280
out um

1482
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,798
the amount of pollen production across

1483
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:24,480
like an agricultural landscape or a wild

1484
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,559
landscape and actually

1485
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,760
a buddy of mine from grad school aaron

1486
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,240
iverson who

1487
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,200
just has been at cornell for the last

1488
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,879
few years and now

1489
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,199
got a faculty position elsewhere we've

1490
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,318
been bouncing around the idea of

1491
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,798
using uh some of these same

1492
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,960
methods to to get a sense of what the

1493
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:43,838
foraging landscape would be like for a

1494
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,039
pollinator

1495
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:51,199
so lots of cool possibilities for that

1496
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,239
there's one other question uh which

1497
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,239
again

1498
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,719
as a plant pathologist and someone who i

1499
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,959
have a project on rust fungi

1500
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,879
so the spores of rust fungi can be can

1501
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,079
be highly ornamented

1502
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,880
and the question is actually um uh can

1503
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,960
can your models be applied to uh rust

1504
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,280
pathogen spores because uh

1505
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,119
several people online today are allergic

1506
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,640
to rust pathogen spores

1507
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,318
and i think to some extent you already

1508
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,440
spoke to that but they are

1509
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:22,719
uh the arena spores tend to be um

1510
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,559
wildly wind windblown totally well

1511
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:30,318
hey i say let's give it a shot let's see

1512
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:33,680
what happens

1513
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,920
and uh one of our um uh

1514
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,719
hemp students says i can't wait to see

1515
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,200
this type of

1516
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,919
modeling applied to pollen and pathogens

1517
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:45,439
in the hemp industry

1518
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,960
any uh any final questions for uh dan

1519
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,358
before we let him go off to his next

1520
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,920
meetings

1521
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:53,598
chelsea i just had a quick one and it

1522
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,760
kind of goes back to your

1523
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,960
detroit study so i apologize if i'm

1524
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,400
getting some of the information wrong

1525
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,838
but i was thinking about

1526
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,559
you were mentioning that that there's a

1527
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,358
preponderance of cases where there's an

1528
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,640
increase in the

1529
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:12,000
in the in certain communities

1530
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:13,440
for being hospitalized for asthma in

1531
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,280
particular areas that are also

1532
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,318
associated with having greater densities

1533
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,880
of ragweed

1534
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,159
did i get that right yeah there's a

1535
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,440
correlation there

1536
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:25,118
um the the causal links are a little

1537
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,200
more tenuous and i'm not going to say

1538
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,838
that and i cannot

1539
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,598
in any way say that it is ragweed that

1540
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,558
completely causes that but

1541
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,880
there could be a fraction of that which

1542
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,160
ragweed contributes to

1543
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,440
so is there i was thinking about that

1544
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,159
from like the public health i mean is

1545
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,679
this a

1546
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,598
a place where the medical

1547
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,598
practitioners could go in and say hey

1548
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,039
look this is an area that

1549
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,240
doesn't have a lot of asthma knowledge

1550
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,838
because i can imagine also certain

1551
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,358
communities just aren't even exposed to

1552
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:54,558
the healthcare system that would provide

1553
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:58,400
them with

1554
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,400
understanding of how asthma can be

1555
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,760
both provoked and prevented in in

1556
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:03,358
children

1557
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,720
um so just thinking that this could be a

1558
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,558
way that the collaboration with the

1559
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,159
medical community say hey listen

1560
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,240
these are areas that are potentially

1561
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,358
high risk these are communities where

1562
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:13,439
you could go

1563
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,798
and and do some public health

1564
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,000
educational services

1565
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:20,960
or offer clinics or things like that

1566
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,079
yeah i think that is one of the the most

1567
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,400
important potential

1568
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,318
applications of this work and my other

1569
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,079
co-advisor here is an allergist

1570
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:30,960
elizabeth matsui

1571
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:34,079
and her claim to fame is doing studies

1572
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,280
in baltimore that looked at

1573
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,000
how differences in pest control

1574
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,359
specifically

1575
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,079
with mice affected people's risk of

1576
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:45,519
developing

1577
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:49,359
asthma um and so um

1578
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:52,400
i'm a plant scientist but i think uh

1579
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:54,639
there's a lot of room here for these

1580
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,760
approaches to be used for public health

1581
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:59,440
interventions

1582
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,920
and and that's why i'm currently

1583
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,119
as a plant scientist based out of a

1584
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,280
medical school here

1585
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,798
so i completely agree thank you for the

1586
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,798
the softball question i love it

1587
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:15,440
and uh bill bill corpay notes

1588
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,798
uh that the methods could be used in uh

1589
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,920
forensic botany

1590
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:23,199
and as an aside bill teaches a class

1591
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,480
oddly in forensic botany yeah

1592
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:29,039
um completely there's actually this

1593
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,318
really interesting project that's being

1594
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,838
done largely at

1595
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,880
ut austin now that's funded through the

1596
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,119
murray mechanism

1597
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,798
this is the department of defense and

1598
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,000
they have this like

1599
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:46,079
god it's it's this massively funded

1600
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,639
project um to use some of this to

1601
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,280
to use pollen as a tracker for figuring

1602
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:52,400
out

1603
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:55,119
where things have been um

1604
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,079
so yeah totally super useful for all of

1605
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,838
that as well

1606
