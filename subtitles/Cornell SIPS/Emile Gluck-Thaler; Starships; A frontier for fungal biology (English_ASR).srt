1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,718
University

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,679
so I want to start right at the very

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,559
beginning so as the name of our lab

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,560
suggests we study fungi as model

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,358
organisms really to try and understand

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,919
um evolutionary processes and to try and

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,199
understand how organisms adapt to ever

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
shifting environments so I'd like to

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,800
start with just a brief overview of the

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,519
fungal Kingdom because not all not

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,439
everyone is always so familiar with them

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,399
or thinking about them all the time so

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:42,759
fungi of course are um the largest

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,239
Kingdom of microbial ukar and as a group

16
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,839
they've been diversifying for just over

17
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,198
1.5 billion years and as you might

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,320
imagine over this amount of time fungi

19
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,358
have radiated out into basically all

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,359
environments on Earth both terrestrial

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,320
and Aquatic and they've evolved a

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
variety of different strategies for

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,280
survival across all these different

24
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,239
environments and in my lab we take a

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
comparative approach to try and

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,640
understand how fungal diversity is

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
generated so rather than focus on just

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,239
one model system on one branch of the

29
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,399
tree we try and leverage multiple model

30
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,319
systems across the fungal Tree of Life

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,079
in a comparative framework to try and

32
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,319
understand what strategies are shared

33
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,639
across different lineages what what

34
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,239
strategies might be more Innovations

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,759
particular particular to a specific

36
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,719
lineage and in this way we really try

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,280
and understand some of the foundational

38
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,840
principles of fungal adaptation and

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,359
fungal

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,359
Evolution and one of the types of

41
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,280
variations that we're most interested in

42
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,759
studying in our lab are fungal

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,960
interactions and this is because sure

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,319
come no surprise in a Plant Pathology

45
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,199
and plant microbiology Department that

46
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,679
fungal interactions literally shape our

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,399
world right so fungal fungi have evolved

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,680
to to interact with humans with animals

49
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,920
with plants with bacteria and with other

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
fungi and the outcomes of these

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,318
interactions are really essential for

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,878
the continued functioning of ecosystem

53
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:20,919
processes and maybe more um visibly the

54
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,000
interactions really impact very

55
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,518
important aspects of human society in

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,039
terms of human health and also Global

57
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,400
Food security and

58
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,959
so the goal in our is really to

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,439
understand fungal interactions as a

60
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,400
process where a process is really

61
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,359
something that is continually unfolding

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
over time so we're interested both both

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,400
in the ecological Dynamics and also

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,639
evolutionary Dynamics and Eco Evo

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,280
dynamics that are driving fungal

66
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,238
adaptations um on in on the interaction

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,800
stage and so there are two main

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
questions that we're really interested

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,280
in understanding in my lab you can boil

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,200
them down to first one when do good

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,360
fungi turn bad so we're really

72
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,959
interested in understanding genetic

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,280
drivers and environmental drivers that

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,598
can um lead to pathogen emergence for

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,598
example from a mutualist or commensal to

76
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,039
a path to a disease-causing organism and

77
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,798
on the other hand and kind of related

78
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,639
we're also interested in how to fungi

79
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,640
learn new tricks so how to establish

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,719
pathogens for example um pick up new

81
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,958
traits or evolve new traits that allow

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,919
them to expand and infect other hosts or

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,000
how do pathogens evolve new strategies

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,000
for overcoming host defenses or in some

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,080
cases some of the control mechanisms or

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,560
control strategies that we try and

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,840
deploy out in the field to control their

88
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,360
um their

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,239
impacts there's of course a major

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
challenge when studying fungal

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,560
interactions and you can boil these down

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,319
to a question of genotypic and

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,598
phenotypic variation right so as many

94
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,919
plant Pathologists in the room will know

95
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,959
getting disease to happen or trying to

96
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,679
uh induce a disease isn't really always

97
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,120
as simple as mixing together one

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,439
pathogenic strain with one particular

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,799
host there's a lot of variation

100
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,280
certainly between species but also

101
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,680
within species and across different

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,000
populations and lineages within the

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,918
species level there's a lot of variation

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,560
in how these fungi are actually

105
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,159
interacting with their hosts and as an

106
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,439
evolutionary biologists I think it's

107
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,280
really important to understand where

108
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,319
this variation comes from so how is it

109
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,279
generated

110
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,599
and what are the outcomes of this

111
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,839
variation um in a very practical sense

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,120
and I think by understanding where

113
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,000
variation comes from and what the

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,038
outcomes are we really position

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,319
ourselves um much better to actually

116
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,639
being able to get one step closer to

117
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,599
being able to predict the outcomes of

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,199
different interactions um as they're

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,479
happening out in the field or even

120
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,919
within our own bodies so that's really

121
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,038
another reason why a lot of the

122
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,120
questions that we ask in the lab span

123
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,680
from the Within species level to between

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,680
species level so as was briefly

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,519
mentioned in the introduction my lab

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,879
takes a three-pronged approach to try

127
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,198
and Tackle this question of um how is

128
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,279
variation generated in fungal

129
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,120
interactions so First We Take a

130
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,119
computational biology perspective and

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,000
this really allows us to discover

132
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,720
patterns that are unfolding in large

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,079
omix data sets then we take an

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,440
evolutionary genomics approach to

135
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,758
actually try and characterize some of

136
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,639
the processes that are responsible for

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,319
generating these patterns that we see um

138
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,120
in in these data sets and across

139
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,560
different species and in this way

140
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,600
generate some sort of comparative

141
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,720
insight into how these processes are

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,319
unfolding across different fungal

143
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,919
species and

144
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,479
populations and then finally we try and

145
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,000
tie it all together with a molecular

146
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:55,478
genetics approach um trying to actually

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,680
conduct some functional characterization

148
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,719
experiments to actually test the

149
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,400
hypotheses that computational biology

150
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,520
and evolutionary genomics are really so

151
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,399
good at generating and also conduct some

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,719
manipulative experiments in the lab

153
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:12,120
along those same lines and over the past

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,199
couple of years and hopefully uh into

155
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,399
the future we've been applying this

156
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,240
approach to a new and emerging concept

157
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,478
within the field of fungal biology and

158
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,879
fungal genetics and that's the concept

159
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,360
of starships and unlike this picture

160
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,240
might suggest or unlike what chat GPT

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
thinks a Starship is these are not the

162
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,639
star sh that are spacecrafts that you

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,280
might have heard um uh or seen in

164
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,038
science fiction shows but rather these

165
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,239
starships that we study in the lab are a

166
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:45,000
newly described super family of

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,360
transposable elements

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
and I don't think this scientist needs

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
any introduction in this room in fact

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,038
I'm looking at a picture of her right

171
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,560
now in the back right corner but of

172
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,120
course um transposons are these really

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,639
interesting features and entities

174
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,639
genetic entities that live within

175
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,400
organismal genomes and they were

176
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
discovered just over 80 years ago by

177
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,799
Barbara mclintoch including some of her

178
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,520
pioneering work done here at

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,720
Cornell and essentially through Dr

180
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,799
mcclint Talk's work she showed that

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
there are particular regions of the

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,520
genome that are capable of transposing

183
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,598
themselves from one location to another

184
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,000
and she was finding that the

185
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,319
consequences or outcomes of these

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,319
interactions that are happening at the

187
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,800
genetic level can have very important

188
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
phenotypic outcomes so in the The Case

189
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,199
of Dr mclin's model organism maze she

190
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,598
was of course finding that this great

191
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,478
variation in pigmentation patterns could

192
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,918
be traced back to the activity of just a

193
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,318
single transposon and these effects were

194
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
largely resulting from where that

195
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,080
transposon ended up as it moved itself

196
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
um between different positions within

197
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,839
the

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
genomes and as a consequence of her

199
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,279
pioneering

200
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,198
work scientists quickly be began to

201
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,839
realize that a lot of the cases of

202
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,240
adaptation that we observe out in nature

203
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,719
and in some cases have been observing

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,199
for decades and even over hundreds of

205
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
years a lot of these cases of adaptation

206
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,800
could ultimately be traced back to the

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,199
activity of these poorly understood and

208
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,120
previously hidden features of organismal

209
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,000
genomes so the classic case of course

210
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,759
being the peppered moth so a lot of

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,038
students learn about this example in

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,598
biology 101 it is the classic case of

213
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,038
adaptation where during the Industrial

214
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,279
Revolution in

215
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,399
England these this particular moth

216
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,319
species underwent a shift to a darker

217
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,158
pigmentation pattern that was better

218
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
able to camouflage it against trees that

219
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,879
were accumulating soot from the

220
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,719
Industrial Revolution it was only a

221
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,799
couple of years ago that researchers

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,560
went back sequenced these genomes and

223
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,799
realized that this change in

224
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,559
pigmentation phenotype just like what Dr

225
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,919
mlin was seeing was actually being

226
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,679
driven by the activity of transposable

227
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,360
elements so really if we want to learn

228
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,838
more about organismal adaptation we

229
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,519
really need to start paying attention to

230
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,200
these often hidden parts of the genome

231
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,078
that can have these out sized phenotypic

232
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,399
consequences but in the 80 or so years

233
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:10,479
since Dr mcclint first described a

234
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,039
transposable element the definition of a

235
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,800
eukariotic transposable element has

236
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,838
essentially remained unchanged and the

237
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,759
definition is a relatively short piece

238
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,160
of DNA that can just move itself from

239
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,399
one location of the genome to the other

240
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,958
but here's where things start to get a

241
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,480
little bit different when it comes to

242
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,479
Starship transposons

243
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,440
so like their name

244
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,360
suggests first thing you need to know

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,200
about a Starship transposon is that it

246
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,759
is much larger than any other eukariotic

247
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,079
transposon described to date in fact it

248
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,360
can often be one to two orders of

249
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,039
magnitude larger than anything else you

250
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,440
would find in a fungal genome or really

251
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,078
in any other eukariotic genome and

252
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,680
actually towards the upper range of uh

253
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,120
the Starship size Spectrum you can get

254
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,919
starships that are actually approaching

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,679
the size of small fungal chromosomes

256
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:06,000
just to give you a sense of perspective

257
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:09,078
there like other transposable elements

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,600
Starships have a recones that we call

259
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:14,199
the captain which is actually the only

260
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,680
Gene that's both sufficient and

261
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,600
necessary for moving the entire element

262
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,399
for transposing the entire element and

263
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,879
some really elegant work was done by

264
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,480
Andrew urkhart to show that this is the

265
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,120
case beyond the captain and here's where

266
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,639
things again start to get a little bit

267
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,360
more more interesting the these

268
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,159
Starships actually carry many other

269
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,519
protein coding genes as genetic cargo

270
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,919
right as you might expect from such a

271
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,278
gigantic transposon there's a lot of

272
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,919
room for other cargo to actually begin

273
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,320
accumulate within the boundaries of the

274
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:51,639
transposon and really at a fundamental

275
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,959
level this is why starships are so

276
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,320
special because the ability to carry

277
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,719
genetic cargo gives them this ability to

278
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,720
make complex contributions two

279
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,959
organismal phenotypes so over here's

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
small little schematic just placing

281
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,838
Starships within the broader context of

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,800
eukaryotic transposon

283
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,920
diversity at the bottom we see the

284
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,639
canonical transposons like the one Dr

285
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,679
mcclint was working with these

286
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,919
transposons are not capable of carrying

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,879
any genetic cargo beyond the romines

288
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,240
that's responsible for movement and so

289
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,120
all of their phenotypic impacts are

290
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,600
largely going to largely going to um

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,120
result from where they end up inserting

292
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
in the genome right if they insert

293
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,440
themselves in a promoter region this can

294
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
lead to a change in gene regulation if

295
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,600
they insert themselves into a protein

296
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,719
coating sequence that can lead to the

297
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,639
generation of a natural knockout so

298
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,320
really their impacts are limited to

299
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,200
their transposition but as you increase

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,120
the size of the transposon moving up

301
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,320
this spectrum to the point where you

302
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,919
have

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,639
Starships because Starships can carry

304
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:05,719
dozens of genes at one time this gives

305
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,519
them much greater ability to impact

306
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,399
phenotypic uh phenotypes of their of

307
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,039
their fungal hosts so in the example of

308
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,639
the Starship here hus which is one of

309
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,599
the first Starships to be

310
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,440
characterized this Starship actually

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,159
carries many different genes that are

312
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,760
each involved in detoxifying a different

313
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,319
type of heavy of heavy metal right so in

314
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,360
this way the Starship is not just

315
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
contributing to a phenotype based on

316
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,519
where it ends up in the genome although

317
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,679
it certainly can do that as well but

318
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,879
rather it's able to impact the

319
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,359
generation of phenotypic

320
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,679
diversity and so what do we know about

321
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,039
Starships so far so from one of our

322
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:49,198
early systematic studies we were able to

323
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,838
um categorize the diversity of Starships

324
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,120
into 11 major

325
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,800
families and here's just a philogenetic

326
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,919
tree showing how all of those different

327
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,240
sequences have evolved over time and in

328
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,198
general this is a very

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,120
diverse um Gene family so even both even

330
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,000
within particular families but certainly

331
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,720
between families the different Captain

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,399
recombinases show very very little

333
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
similarity to each other indicating that

334
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,759
through some combination of Rapid

335
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,039
Evolution but also Evolution over long

336
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,879
periods of times these elements have

337
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,599
been diversifying in fungal genomes for

338
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,759
quite some time and we estimate just

339
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,480
close to 400 million years of evolution

340
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,000
based on how they're

341
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,320
distributed we also know that Starships

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
they're not a kingdom wide phenomenon

343
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,240
but rather they're concentrated within a

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,159
particular subm of filamentous fungi

345
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,600
called the

346
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:44,679
Poma this was really lucky for us

347
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,240
because many of the fungi that caused

348
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:50,399
diseases on humans and also on plants

349
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,278
are found within the Poma we see some

350
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,480
evidence of Starships in some bidio

351
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,919
lineages but um we're not really quite

352
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,079
sure how they have ended up there and

353
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,039
we're trying to figure that out right

354
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,439
now and then as I was saying the ability

355
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,759
to carry

356
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,040
cargo has resulted in many different

357
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,278
Starships encoding very diverse traits

358
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,198
so since we first described the Starship

359
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,759
super

360
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:16,519
family people have been other groups

361
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,360
have been coming out with many different

362
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,720
papers and our groups as well showing

363
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,480
that different starships are

364
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,000
contributing in different ways to some

365
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,000
of the phenotypes that we really care

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,559
about studying so for example phenotypes

367
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,198
like veillance evolution plant

368
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:37,039
pathogenic fungi um and also heavy metal

369
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,799
resistance I mentioned before and so um

370
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,799
and as you might notice a lot of these

371
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,159
papers are currently still in the

372
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,078
pre-print stage so we really still are

373
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:49,000
at the beginning of understanding just

374
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:52,000
how broad the impact of starships are on

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,120
fungal adaptation and fungal Evolution

376
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,198
and so in my lab right now what we're

377
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,360
doing is framing this question of fungal

378
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,919
interactions through the lens of

379
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,879
starships and we're asking now how are

380
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,838
Starships actually mediating fungal

381
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,919
interactions with both plant and animal

382
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
hosts and essentially trying to

383
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,439
understand what are the parameters of

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,600
this newly described mechanism of fungal

385
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,639
Evolution so the takeaway from today's

386
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,560
talk I'll be sharing two recent stories

387
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,639
that have um come out of some of the

388
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,958
work we've been doing over the past year

389
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,399
uh with many different collaborators

390
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:37,559
just showing everyone here how Starships

391
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,120
really provide fuel for fungal Evolution

392
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,078
and I'm going to show you how they do

393
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,600
this on two different levels first is

394
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,758
through generating genotypic variation

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,600
at the level of genome structure but

396
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,680
also at the level of genome content and

397
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,120
then second we'll start getting into

398
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,039
what I think is really going to be the

399
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,198
next Frontier of Starship biology

400
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:03,679
understanding the role of these elements

401
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:05,958
as a mechanism of fungal horizontal Gene

402
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,318
transfer so for this first part over

403
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:11,159
here understanding contributions of

404
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:15,039
Starships to genome structure and genome

405
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,078
content we were working with a large

406
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,799
genomic data set of the opportunistic

407
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:22,120
human pathogen aspila

408
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,758
Godus there's a lot of there's a lot of

409
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,399
interest in understanding the genetic

410
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,318
mechanisms of strain heterogenity in

411
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,440
this particular opportunity gentic

412
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,599
pathogen just because it is one of the

413
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,480
number one killers of imuno compromised

414
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,319
patients and so we were working with

415
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,399
just over 500 short read genomes we also

416
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:43,120
went ahead and sequenced 12 new longer

417
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,120
read genomes which would give us this

418
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,159
ability to actually be able to more uh

419
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,440
precisely resolve the Dynamics that were

420
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,958
happening at the population level so

421
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,000
what we did was we essentially applied

422
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,318
this new tool that I developed for

423
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,318
annotating Starship elements to this

424
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:02,759
data set and ended up with this

425
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,678
compendium of starships that are active

426
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,279
within this particular species so I'm

427
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,319
just going to walk you through how we

428
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,759
then interrogated this data set or

429
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,519
interrogated this compendium to try and

430
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:16,599
understand now some of the rules and

431
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,119
foundational biology of these

432
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,279
elements so first things first once we

433
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,000
had all the Starships what we did was we

434
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:29,160
tried to classify them into different

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,640
unique types because one Starship even

436
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,640
though they're part of the same super

437
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,960
family can actually be quite distinct

438
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
from one another at a sequence level so

439
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,720
when we did that we found that there are

440
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,558
at least 20 distinct starships that are

441
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,160
actively transposing within this

442
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,798
particular species over here you'll see

443
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,440
just a heat map about how these 20

444
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,160
different Starships Are distributed

445
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,400
across the population that we worked

446
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,558
with you can see like as you might

447
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,798
expect from a mobile element and we know

448
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,960
this from bacterial mobile elements very

449
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,798
often these genetic entities has have

450
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,240
very patchy distributions across

451
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,480
different populations so you can see

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,679
that recapitulated over

453
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,480
here also mentioned that many of these

454
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,120
Starships really share little to no

455
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,640
sequence identity with each other

456
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,399
indicating that many of them are

457
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,240
carrying different combinations of cargo

458
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,080
genes and something that I like to point

459
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,319
out is that unlike a canonical

460
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,359
transposon you will only ever find these

461
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,439
Starships in a single copy within a

462
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,879
particular genome so there appears to be

463
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,038
some mechanism controlling copy number

464
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,440
within this particular species we

465
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,079
already know that that mechanism can

466
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,600
break down because other species can

467
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,918
accumulate multiple copies um but we're

468
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,839
really still not quite sure what that

469
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,919
mechanism might be and whether it's host

470
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,720
controlled or Starship

471
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,440
controlled uh right uh one of the

472
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,360
benefits with working with fuma Godus is

473
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,798
that people have sampled this fungus

474
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,558
from literally everywhere on Earth but

475
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,119
also from outside Earth in space on the

476
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:01,359
International Space Station so a couple

477
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,798
of our isolates were indeed sampled from

478
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,599
the space station so I can confirm that

479
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,359
Starships have made it to space because

480
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,639
we can find them up there as well

481
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,240
looking down on us so after we try to

482
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,159
understand where these starships are

483
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,000
found at between different individuals

484
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,760
we then wanted to understand where

485
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,640
they're found within the genome itself

486
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,240
so what I've done here

487
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,080
is okay what I've done here is map out

488
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,839
the eight chromosomes of the reference

489
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,720
FEMA goddess string we have 293 and

490
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,038
along the perimeter I've indicated all

491
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,519
of the segregating Starship insertion

492
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,519
sites so these are sites in Black over

493
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,519
here where Starship is present in some

494
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,759
other individual in the population but

495
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,599
absent from this one particular

496
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:50,679
reference string and then in red over

497
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:54,000
here you can see the uh eight starships

498
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,600
that are present in this one particular

499
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,759
individual if you add up all the

500
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,439
sequence that's contained within this

501
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,158
mobile

502
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,320
compartment we get upwards of 2 and a

503
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,679
half% of genome content actually being

504
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,319
located within these mobile elements and

505
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,280
when we add up all of the different

506
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,279
insertion sites across the entire

507
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,480
population there just over 150 unique

508
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:21,399
insertion sites where Starships Are

509
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,519
generating this genomewide structural

510
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,038
variation just to give you a sense of

511
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,759
the upward bounds of Starship mediated

512
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:33,319
structural VAR iation over here I'm

513
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,200
showing the single Locus with the

514
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,200
highest concentration of Starship

515
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,279
activity so all so this is a Cy plot so

516
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,000
regions of similarity are indicated in

517
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,918
Gray over here each line is a different

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,319
isolet and this is just obviously a

519
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,960
subsample of the isets in our

520
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,678
collection in red outlined in red are

521
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,480
all of the different starships that are

522
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,840
found at this one particular Locus and

523
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,038
in uh different colors over here here

524
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,558
might be of interest to some people in

525
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,599
the room these are all different

526
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,879
biosynthetic Gene clusters that are

527
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,399
encoded in this one Locus so what I

528
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,880
think is really interesting about this

529
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,080
example it really shows how much

530
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,720
variation can accumulate in just a

531
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,879
particular region due solely to Starship

532
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,120
transposition activity right so in some

533
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,720
cases we have Starships actually

534
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:27,479
introducing a biosynthetic gene cluster

535
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,079
to this BGC hotspot in other cases we

536
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,558
have starships that are coming in and

537
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,918
inserting themselves within a particular

538
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,000
cluster like over here or just Upstream

539
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,120
of different clusters we don't know what

540
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,880
the phenotypic consequences of these

541
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,079
insertion events are yet but now we

542
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,960
actually have a hypothesis that we can

543
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:49,798
go back to the lab and actually

544
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,759
interrogate um in more detail but

545
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,359
essentially the takeaway here is that

546
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,200
really nowhere is safe in The genome

547
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,240
from Starships actually being able to

548
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,360
insert themselves something I also like

549
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,880
to point out I get this question a lot

550
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:10,439
is how Faithful is transposition so over

551
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,400
here I've pulled out the same Starship

552
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,600
across a dozen or so

553
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,159
isolates and the Starship is found

554
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,278
across different genomic locations so

555
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,799
that's why you see synony only between

556
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:25,000
the different Starship copies but not

557
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,400
between the flanking regions in this

558
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,240
particular plot and as you can tell the

559
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,880
boundaries of the star ship are pretty

560
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,720
Faithfully maintained across

561
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,400
transposition events there is some

562
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,640
variation some inp specific variation in

563
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,000
what this Starship actually looks like

564
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,038
and so we know that's the answer to this

565
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,679
question of whether or not content is

566
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,599
maintained between transposition events

567
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,159
or between different isolates it's both

568
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,199
a a yes and question it is maintained

569
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,600
but then also these sequences are part

570
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,600
of the genome and of course are

571
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,639
experiencing the same types of

572
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,199
mutational events that other sequence in

573
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,120
the genome is experiencing and so they

574
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,120
are also changing over time although we

575
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,639
don't really quite know if they're

576
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:09,199
changing in the same way or if they're

577
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,320
changing in slightly different

578
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,400
ways so that was looking at Starships

579
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,678
across the genome now we wanted to

580
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,679
understand what impact Starships might

581
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,679
be having on the pangenome so the

582
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,640
pangenome is the complete set of genes

583
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,440
or genetic sequences found across all

584
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,038
individuals in a population

585
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,720
so I was saying within any one

586
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,519
particular genome around 2 and a half%

587
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,839
of the genetic content is located on a

588
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,278
Starship but when you try and scale that

589
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,798
up to now look at how much genetic

590
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:45,880
variation is contained on Starships

591
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:50,038
within the Pang genome across all these

592
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,520
isolates we see that around 3 to 5% of

593
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,480
all of the genes in the Pang genome are

594
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,639
found at least once on a Starship and in

595
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,599
particular the genes that tend to be

596
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,559
enriched on Starships no surprise are

597
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,480
so-called accessory genes and accessory

598
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:05,399
genes are genes whose presence and

599
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,960
absence differs across individuals

600
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,600
within a population so upwards of 16% of

601
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,000
accessory genes are Starship mobilized

602
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,319
and we're really really excited about

603
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
this finding because for a long time we

604
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,158
didn't really quite understand what

605
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,480
contributed to variation in gene

606
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,919
presence absence outside of canonical

607
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,558
genetic mechanisms now we have some

608
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,399
really good evidence that it is the

609
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,158
mobility of the starships that could be

610
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,959
contributing to the presence absence

611
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,679
variation in these accessory genes thus

612
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,079
generating variation in genomic content

613
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,278
and the reason for this we'll get into

614
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,798
aspects of horizontal transfer Gene gain

615
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,319
a little bit later but something that's

616
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,000
important to know is that being located

617
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,359
on a transposable element also

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,519
predisposes genes on that element to

619
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,759
being lost because not every

620
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,158
transposition event is ultimately

621
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,839
successful and it's been shown in the

622
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,799
lab that

623
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,720
occasionally a Starship will fail to

624
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,440
reintegrate into the genome during a

625
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,880
transposition event leading to the loss

626
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,480
of that Gene of all of the genes located

627
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,360
on that particular element so in this

628
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,159
way starships are both mediating Gene

629
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,678
gain through horizontal transfer and

630
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,640
also Gene loss through just failed

631
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,399
transposition

632
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,240
events so because fagus is this model

633
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,558
organism there's been a lot of work done

634
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,319
to try and understand the functions of

635
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:31,158
genes involved in inter in different

636
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,599
host interactions within Godus and

637
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,840
something that became very quickly clear

638
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:40,599
was that their Starships in this species

639
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,519
carry Loi carry genes that people have

640
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:45,079
been studying for

641
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,879
decades because of their involvement in

642
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,879
particular interactions so the best case

643
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,120
of that is here with the biofilm

644
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,320
architecture

645
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:58,519
Factor this particular Gene bath is

646
00:25:53,319 --> 00:26:00,359
shared across actually um six or seven

647
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,519
different types of Starships so there

648
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,839
seems to be this very strong association

649
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,240
between this B architecture factor and

650
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,240
mobile

651
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,440
Starships we're interested in this

652
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,759
particular Gene because it's been shown

653
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,600
by some of our collaborators that it is

654
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,038
responsible for

655
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,439
mediating biofilm morphology so the

656
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:22,480
ability to form uh biofilms which is

657
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,080
important from a human health standpoint

658
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,000
and also more importantly it's able to

659
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,678
increase and affect how this fungus row

660
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,798
under low hypoxic conditions which

661
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,480
ultimately impact the virence of this

662
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,558
fungus so here we have a really cool

663
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,240
example of a trait actually being

664
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:40,839
localized to one of these mobile

665
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,359
elements so if you want to understand

666
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,558
how this trait evolves how this trait

667
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,119
gets disseminated or spread throughout

668
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:49,079
different pathogen

669
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,918
lineages first step is actually

670
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,798
realizing that it is located on a mobile

671
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,320
element and that opens up some new

672
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,519
avenues for understanding how these

673
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,200
phenotypes evolve over time we also

674
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,918
noticed that there are a couple of

675
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,880
biosynthetic Gene clusters located on

676
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,919
Starships which again gives us some

677
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,080
insight into how these metabolic

678
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,960
phenotypes are evolving and changing

679
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,480
over time these two examples over here

680
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,200
were actually identified just over eight

681
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,558
years ago by ant Antonis rus' group they

682
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
were the first to realize that these

683
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,480
clusters were actually found in

684
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,798
different parts of the genome depending

685
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,000
on what strain you looked at they named

686
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:31,038
this phenomenon a mobile Gene cluster

687
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,440
and here we're actually showing that the

688
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,759
Starships Are the mechanism that's

689
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,120
resulted in these clusters ending up in

690
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,240
different locations of the genome and

691
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,759
since that paper came out there's been

692
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,399
some functional work done to

693
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,319
characterize the products of these bgc's

694
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,798
and interestingly one of them the fuma

695
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,879
German is involved in mediating fungal

696
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,519
bacterial interaction so this molecule

697
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,640
actually suppresses bacterial Spore

698
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,000
germination so it could be important

699
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,278
from a competitive sample we're looking

700
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,398
to dive a little bit deeper into exactly

701
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:08,319
how that works and also a molecule fah

702
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,479
hopeside a which is involved in

703
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,000
increasing Thermo tolerance and also

704
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,440
tolerance to UV stresses so over here

705
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,200
again a really great indication of how

706
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,000
Starships how their genotypes could

707
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,840
ultimately impact the phenotypes of the

708
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,278
funi that we're studying and how

709
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,439
mobilization in particular could impact

710
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:33,278
the evolution of these phenotypes

711
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,278
and so over here um just to this is just

712
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,480
kind of one side story just to show like

713
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,359
just how many hypotheses and new

714
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,640
directions this data set has opened up

715
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:48,719
for us so one of the um findings of the

716
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,759
analysis was that Starship Starships

717
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,720
carry not not only enzyme encoding genes

718
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,200
but they also carry transcription

719
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,679
factors and using some of the tools

720
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,319
developed by our collaborators in the

721
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,360
Keller lab we can see that in many cases

722
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,678
the transcription factors carried by the

723
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,158
starships are embedded into larger Gene

724
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,559
regulatory networks in the cell so over

725
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,080
here I've just colorcoded all of the uh

726
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:20,558
transcription factors found in Starships

727
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:22,199
as these colored um diamonds over here

728
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:26,119
and each connection between a node in

729
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,319
this network is indicating a significant

730
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,759
correlation in gene expression between

731
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,200
these two different loide so you can see

732
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,679
that these Starship transcription

733
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,440
factors some of them are only associated

734
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,759
with the regulation of other genes on

735
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,038
the Starship like in this case over here

736
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,359
but in some cases you have these

737
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:46,798
Starships which tend to be associated

738
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:51,319
with the expression of many other genes

739
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:53,918
across the genome so yes the C on the

740
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:57,319
screen is not track curs on oh thank you

741
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,799
I think yes thank you so these

742
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:03,359
transcriptions factors over here are the

743
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,679
ones that we're finding in Starships is

744
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,558
that clear for

745
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,640
everyone so over here we're trying to

746
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:13,000
use this now as a model for

747
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,399
understanding who is regulating who in

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,440
this interaction that's happening

749
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,319
between the transposon and the fungal

750
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,640
genome at large are these interactions

751
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,240
that we're seeing these hypothetical

752
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,200
interactions that we're seeing in the

753
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,079
network evidence that the host is

754
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,640
somehow controlling expression of

755
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,599
Starships

756
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,159
or conversely is it some evidence that

757
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,959
the transcription factors being carried

758
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,399
as cargo are somehow manipulating other

759
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,840
potentially other phenotypes that are

760
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:41,518
encoded elsewhere in the fungal cell and

761
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,959
postto in the lab right now is trying to

762
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,519
dive in knock out some of these

763
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,200
transcription factors and try and

764
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,319
understand what their phenotypic impacts

765
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,278
are so that wraps up the first section

766
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:57,158
of the talk just looking at what these

767
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:59,038
elements are doing at a population level

768
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,159
now we're going to shift to a more

769
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,440
between species approach to try and

770
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,960
understand the role of Starships in

771
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,240
actually mediating Gene transfer between

772
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,558
different species and this work is a

773
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,798
collaboration with Andrew urkhart and

774
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,720
Andrew and Aaron vogan um a lot of the

775
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,798
lab work I'll say all of the lab work

776
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,440
was done by Andrew he's just started up

777
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,759
his own lab U Down in Melbourne

778
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Australia where he's going to be looking

779
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,000
into this a lot more

780
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,639
so to start off with our

781
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,398
interest in Starship horizontal Gene

782
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:40,079
transfer begins with this particular

783
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,439
Gene cluster called the ssf cluster

784
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,678
which encodes a pathway for f Malahide

785
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,880
degradation now all three of us

786
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:50,200
initially became really interested in

787
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,919
this um in this Gene cluster because it

788
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,440
was found on a couple of the starships

789
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,600
that we were studying at the time and

790
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,639
just because it seemed to really

791
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,879
exquisitly encode

792
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:03,158
the complete pathway for formaly

793
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,320
degradation I would say we were

794
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,039
initially a little bit confused why

795
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:08,798
would fungi have evolved this really

796
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,440
sophisticated genetic architecture for

797
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,319
deating form Malahide and I would say

798
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,000
our confusion was really just a result

799
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,398
of our own ignorance we didn't quite

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,759
realize how pervasive for Malahide is in

801
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,558
natural environments we were thinking

802
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,158
that it might only be linked to human

803
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,519
activities but in fact formaly is

804
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,760
produced usually as a byproduct of a lot

805
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,200
of different plant metabolic pathways

806
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,480
and in these cases in some cases it's

807
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,679
been shown that the production of

808
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,319
formaly acts as this antimicrobial agent

809
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,360
that can protect particularly fruits

810
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,720
from fungal colonization or bacterial

811
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,519
colonization so this got us really

812
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,880
interested in understanding this cluster

813
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,319
because potentially it could be

814
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,320
providing adaptive uh benefits to fungi

815
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,599
that are encountering form Malahide out

816
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,439
in their environment especially a lot of

817
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,480
fungi that are interacting with plant

818
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,080
material so I said we were interested in

819
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,839
the cluster primarily because it was

820
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:07,720
found on a Starship and as we dug into

821
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:09,638
it a little bit more we came to realize

822
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,200
that actually it's not just found on a

823
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:15,000
single Starship but this cluster is

824
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,639
actually shared across four very

825
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,919
distantly related Starships so I've

826
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:24,678
aligned those Starships over

827
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,840
here so you can see in most cases only

828
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,360
the formaly degrading cluster which is

829
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,959
outlined in blue over here is shared

830
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,719
among these vastly Divergent elements

831
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,759
and in some cases the cluster itself

832
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,360
shares relatively High nucleotide

833
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,638
similarities certainly higher than you

834
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,759
would expect just given uh given the um

835
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:45,240
element wide

836
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,398
comparisons so we were of course really

837
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,519
interested in trying to identify the

838
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,398
process that was responsible for

839
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,720
producing this particular pattern so we

840
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:58,359
took a phenetics approach to

841
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,360
understand during what time in The

842
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,319
evolutionary history of these Starships

843
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,558
did they acire the cluster and so when

844
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:09,078
we did that we found that this in each

845
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,358
of these cases these Starships seem to

846
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,440
have independently acquired the cluster

847
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,639
from somewhere so over here we have a a

848
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,039
tree of the captain romines that acts as

849
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,320
a proxy for understanding the evolution

850
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,679
of the element as a whole and over here

851
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,919
we've just mapped out the presence

852
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,398
absence of the various genes that are

853
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:29,358
found within this cluster so you can see

854
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:32,039
on the tree over here we have these four

855
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,319
spots within the tree where the cluster

856
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,519
just suddenly appears to now be

857
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,960
associated with a particular Starship so

858
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,320
I think this is pretty good evidence

859
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,639
that this process was a process of

860
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,399
convergent acquisition and not a process

861
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,519
of inheritance um through vertical

862
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,398
descent and what was really interesting

863
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,679
was that in each of the cases where the

864
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:57,799
Starship appeared to have acquired the

865
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,519
formaly degrading cluster each of these

866
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,720
events coincides with a horizontal

867
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:06,320
transfer event between different fungal

868
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,358
species so in this case over here

869
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,800
between four different species we saw

870
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:13,319
evidence over here between two here

871
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,760
three and here two again so in each of

872
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,359
the cases it seems like the convergent

873
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,880
acquisition of this cluster is priming

874
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,480
fungi to adapt via horizontal Gene

875
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,079
transfer that's mediated by The

876
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Starships themselves and you can just

877
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,480
get a sense over here from what that

878
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,159
horizontal transfer looks like at a

879
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,480
genetic level so here we're comparing

880
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:41,199
two species putative donors and putative

881
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,358
recipients from different fungal species

882
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:47,358
all these dots represent a gene that's

883
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:48,799
been um that's been blasted essentially

884
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,000
from one genome to the other so you'll

885
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,079
see for the most part A lot of these

886
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,838
comparisons the median Gene identity at

887
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,160
the nucleotide level is just around 70%

888
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,838
or maybe a little bit higher up here in

889
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,879
red are all of those Starship Associated

890
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:07,400
genes in Red so in many cases these

891
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,599
genes are showing 100% nucleotide

892
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,800
identity across different species much

893
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,160
more than you would expect most simple

894
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,880
explanation in this case is one of

895
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,399
horizontal Gene transfer and so we of

896
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,559
course wanted to understand what effect

897
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,639
horizontal acquisition of the star

898
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,799
might have on a recipient fungus and we

899
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:31,199
were lucky enough that we found uh one

900
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,480
of the PA very often working with

901
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,239
genomic sequences the isels are

902
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,920
typically not always available but in

903
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:42,479
this one particular case we were able to

904
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,880
acquire isets from both the donor PES

905
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,639
asilis and also the recipient peses over

906
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,358
here so we had a nice collection of both

907
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,838
Starship positive and Starship negative

908
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:56,519
strings that we could

909
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:58,400
test and as predicted by the genotype by

910
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,039
the Starship genotype

911
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,440
the fungi that had the

912
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,358
Starship had a phenotype of increased

913
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,920
form Malahide resistance so over here we

914
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,759
see increasing formaly concentration

915
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,280
over here we have the different isolates

916
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,200
either Starship positive or Starship

917
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,000
negative it's really only those isolet

918
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:19,399
that have the Starship with the formaly

919
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,639
degrading cluster thank you these isolet

920
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,800
over here

921
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:27,118
positive and negative only the isolates

922
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,560
with the cluster that actually have the

923
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,358
predicted phenotype of increased formaly

924
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,719
resistance this is really exciting

925
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,639
because it suggests that we might

926
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,799
actually be able to predict phenotypes

927
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,159
remember that's one of our ultimate

928
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,839
goals is trying to predict the outcomes

929
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,598
of fungal interactions with their

930
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,519
environment and with host here we're

931
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,000
showing that it is actually possible to

932
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,239
predict in some cases the phenotype of

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,159
the fungus based on what its Starship

934
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,919
genotype might

935
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,598
be so now we're going to shift

936
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,280
perspectives a little bit try and

937
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,519
understand some of the broad broader

938
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,079
consequences or broader context of

939
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:06,559
Starship activity within fungal genomes

940
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,760
so before I was showing you Evolution

941
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,679
from the perspective of the Starship

942
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,040
itself so how the Starship is evolving

943
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,078
over time here we're taking a different

944
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,838
perspective and trying to understand

945
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,640
Evolution from the perspective of the

946
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:24,559
formaly degrading cluster so over here

947
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:26,078
we have a biogenetic tree of uh one of

948
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,920
the genes within the cluster that's

949
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,920
acting as a proxy for understanding

950
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,159
evolution of the cluster as a whole and

951
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,440
we see a very interesting evolutionary

952
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,440
pattern playing out here we see that

953
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,639
there are some

954
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,838
clades in within this tree where this

955
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,920
formaly cluster appears to be so

956
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,358
associated with Starships as expected

957
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,159
right that's what we went into this

958
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:53,318
analysis knowing but in other cases we

959
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:56,838
see examples where the

960
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:58,000
cluster is associated with a degraded

961
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:00,599
Starship

962
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,159
so we have this scenario where the cargo

963
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,599
in the cluster becomes mobile when it's

964
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:06,799
acquired by the Starship and can be

965
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,519
shared between different species but

966
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,839
then the flip side of that is we also

967
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,239
see the consequences of what happens

968
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,799
when the Starship begins to degrade and

969
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,519
in these cases the cargo once again

970
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,079
becomes part of the non-mobile

971
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,719
compartment of the genome but by this

972
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,640
time it could have ended up in a

973
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,199
different species for example or in a

974
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,759
different genomic location in the cases

975
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,598
of up here and so this was really

976
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,880
interesting because one of the mysteries

977
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,760
of fungal genomics has always been how

978
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,400
do why are we finding genes in different

979
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,720
places in the genome all the time why

980
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,119
are we finding what look to be near

981
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,318
identical copies of the same gene across

982
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,039
different species and before we didn't

983
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:51,800
really have a satisfying mechanism for

984
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:55,119
being able to explain that but I think

985
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,359
what we're seeing here is that Starships

986
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,280
do provide now a very convincing

987
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:03,078
explanation for why we might be ending

988
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,640
up with very diverse patterns in gene

989
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,359
location um and also Gene distributions

990
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,279
both within species and also uh across

991
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,400
species and this isn't to say that there

992
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,960
aren't other genetic mechanisms that are

993
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
also responsible for producing these

994
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,280
patterns canonical mechanisms like

995
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,800
recombination either parasexual

996
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,480
recombination or sexual recombination

997
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,400
but here in this particular case we're

998
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,880
just seeing just what the impact that

999
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,160
Starships can have on this one

1000
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,000
particular J family providing a very

1001
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:34,039
satisfying explanation for how this

1002
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,800
particular cluster has ended up so

1003
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,960
widely distributed even when all

1004
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,560
evidence of Starship associations might

1005
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,559
have been

1006
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:47,039
erased so with that getting back to this

1007
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,759
main question over here and just

1008
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,000
wrapping up how are Starships mediating

1009
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,880
fungal interactions with their

1010
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,079
environment and with their

1011
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,960
hosts the two stories that I've shared

1012
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,119
today I Hope they've demonstrated that

1013
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,280
Starships really are fueling variation

1014
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,318
in genome structure and genome content

1015
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,680
and also we now have very convincing

1016
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:11,679
evidence also some laboratory

1017
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,519
experiments that Andrew has been running

1018
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,159
that we didn't have a chance to get into

1019
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,000
right now we have very convincing

1020
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,159
evidence that starships are indeed a

1021
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,639
mechanism of fungal horizontal Gene

1022
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,598
transfer and over here try to create a

1023
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:27,639
model that summarizes everything that

1024
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,318
youve just heard over here what we're

1025
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:35,358
really advocating now is a shift in how

1026
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:39,079
we conceive of fungal genome space so

1027
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,559
current theory in fungal genomics will

1028
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,640
divide up the genome into two different

1029
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:45,519
types of compartments you have dynamic

1030
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,679
or accessory compartments that are

1031
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,800
changing rapidly and then we have core

1032
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,480
compartments which are more conserved

1033
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,720
within species and also um between

1034
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,519
species what we're seeing now is that

1035
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,358
actually there is a third type of

1036
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:02,159
compartment and and that's the Starship

1037
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:04,960
compartment which consists of the mobile

1038
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,159
fraction of the genome and this is

1039
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,199
really important for a number of reasons

1040
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:11,838
but fundamentally the ability to

1041
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,118
transpose or the ability to be

1042
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,318
mobile puts the genes in this

1043
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,760
compartment on a different evolutionary

1044
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,279
trajectory compared to genes in other

1045
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,960
genomic compartments and this is

1046
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,319
because through Starship mediated

1047
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,000
movement these genetic cargo can end up

1048
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,239
new individuals through horizontal

1049
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,960
transfer

1050
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,598
events they can also end up at new sites

1051
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,519
within the same

1052
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,318
species or can ultimately lead to loss

1053
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,719
of that mobile cargo through failed

1054
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:46,079
transposition then over time eventually

1055
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:48,879
it seems like many Starships can keep

1056
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,800
going for some time but one possible

1057
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,800
outcome is that those Mobility features

1058
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,480
are

1059
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,519
lost the cargo then reintegrates back

1060
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,880
into either dynamic or accessory

1061
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,239
compartments or sometimes even into core

1062
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,079
compartments over here so really by just

1063
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:06,000
proposing Starships as this new genomic

1064
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,000
compartment we're hoping that this can

1065
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,519
now provide more mechanistic

1066
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,880
explanations for genome Evolution across

1067
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:17,440
different Poma fungi and so now the next

1068
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,160
steps really in this process are to

1069
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,838
continue charting the Starship genotype

1070
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,838
to fungal phenotype map try and now

1071
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:26,719
understands understand not only fungal

1072
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,039
interactions with their environment and

1073
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:32,039
with host posts but also understand how

1074
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,159
fungi are interacting with these genetic

1075
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,480
entities that are actually embedded

1076
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,199
within their

1077
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,719
genomes so I'd like to thank some of the

1078
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:44,239
folks involved in supporting me and also

1079
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,279
supporting this work all the folks um in

1080
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,799
the fungal interactions lab as well as

1081
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,640
some collaborators um both across the US

1082
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,280
and also in Europe and

1083
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:59,598
Australia um and always like to mention

1084
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,559
that this process of actually

1085
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,000
discovering Starships as a feature of

1086
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,440
fungal genomes certainly not something I

1087
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
did by myself this was really a

1088
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,280
collaborative

1089
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,800
approach through that really resulted in

1090
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,079
us being able to really rapidly move

1091
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,839
forward in our knowledge of these

1092
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,160
elements over a period of just four

1093
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:22,480
years now um to really try and more

1094
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,440
quickly and effectively understand what

1095
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,318
their role is in fungal biology and so

1096
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,200
I'll just highlight some of um my

1097
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,880
collaborators that have been involved in

1098
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:36,759
this process and recently we just wrote

1099
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,920
a little chapter in uh fungal genomics

1100
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,920
um textbook over here kind of

1101
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,920
documenting the timeline of this

1102
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,240
particular Discovery really just

1103
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,960
highlighting how processes like openness

1104
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,558
transparency and data sharing really

1105
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,240
resulted in a lot of different groups

1106
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,280
independently semi-independently coming

1107
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,519
up with this concept at the same time so

1108
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,800
I would encourage you to maybe um take a

1109
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,519
peek at this chapter if you're

1110
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,200
interested in understanding how this

1111
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,000
process of discovery unfolded um over

1112
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,759
the past couple of years and so with

1113
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,480
that I'd be happy to take any

1114
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,680
questions um we do specifically want to

1115
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,039
um ask students uh for questions first

1116
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:19,399
and give students particularly an

1117
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:22,838
opportunity to ask questions first so

1118
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,000
okay great and I'll also be looking for

1119
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:28,358
questions on

1120
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,358
Zoom yes in the back what it is about

1121
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:34,279
the genetic structure of these transpl

1122
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,920
elements that allow them to carry these

1123
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Gene groups with them in a way that

1124
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,920
other trans developments can if you know

1125
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,400
yeah we don't know and I think that's

1126
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,760
going to be my answer to probably a lot

1127
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,240
of questions today like we still we

1128
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,599
really still don't understand how these

1129
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,399
things work we don't really understand

1130
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:55,400
how those boundaries are maintained

1131
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,639
across different transposition events um

1132
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,599
definitely something we're interested in

1133
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,960
figur out

1134
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:05,359
yeah yes so I know there are other Comin

1135
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,280
elements that don't carry around cargo

1136
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,519
genes like this so if you make a

1137
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,440
philogyny of all the Starship tyrosine

1138
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,880
recombinations and the tyrosine

1139
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,720
recombinations of those other elements

1140
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,960
do you see that they seem to have like a

1141
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:20,399
monoptic origin and there's one type of

1142
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,760
this element that can gain this ability

1143
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,480
or it happening all the time that's a

1144
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,640
great question and that was that is

1145
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,000
actually a question we could answer um

1146
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:33,519
and really question oh yes thank you so

1147
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,920
the question was are Starship tyrosine

1148
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,679
recommon ases monoptic or have they

1149
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,838
appeared multiple times over

1150
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,318
evolutionary history the answer to that

1151
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:46,480
question is that they are monoptic so in

1152
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:50,119
this philogenetic tree over here all of

1153
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,358
the at least fungal and even bacterial

1154
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:57,039
tyros recommen that we were able to fit

1155
00:46:52,358 --> 00:47:00,119
into this tree all of them appear um uh

1156
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:03,480
external to this particular sorry all of

1157
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:06,720
them appear external to the Starship

1158
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,679
tyros comod so they do share one single

1159
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,598
common origin something interesting

1160
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:14,039
about just tyrosine or common ases in

1161
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,480
general some of them like fungal

1162
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,440
cryptons for example they don't carry

1163
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,039
cargo but there are other tyrosine

1164
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,760
recombinases in bacteria that are like

1165
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,199
bacterial analogs of Starships they're

1166
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,400
called integrative and conjugative

1167
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,118
elements and so so in those cases those

1168
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,838
tyrosinases also appear to be capable of

1169
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,880
carrying cargo we don't know if it's

1170
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:39,480
something particular about a tyros Romas

1171
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,280
some convergence in protein function or

1172
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,679
structure yeah I'm not sure

1173
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,720
why yes uh excellent talk I really

1174
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,598
enjoyed your figures and and diagrams

1175
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,719
and things like that my question was I

1176
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,280
was really interested in how um you were

1177
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,000
looking at the Fahy biosythesis pathway

1178
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,359
and how a whole biosythesis pathway

1179
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,679
could fit onto a transposable element

1180
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,400
it's pretty cool are there any other

1181
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:08,118
um like biosynthetic Pathways or things

1182
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,920
that you guys are pursuing now after

1183
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,800
looking at the mahide one yeah

1184
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,838
definitely yeah the I I've been studying

1185
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,519
metabolic Gene clusters for a long time

1186
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:19,558
just starting in my PhD actually and

1187
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,759
when you think about it it really makes

1188
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,559
a lot of sense from a selection

1189
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,000
perspective that entire Pathways would

1190
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,040
be located on mobile element and in fact

1191
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,358
some of the earliest

1192
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,759
hypotheses um in particular put out by

1193
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:36,598
John

1194
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,400
Walton he was he was one of the first to

1195
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:41,680
suggest that maybe the actual selection

1196
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,680
to form a biosynthetic gene cluster came

1197
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,558
from this selection pressure to actually

1198
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,199
be maintained to have the pathway

1199
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,319
maintained after a transfer EV so from

1200
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:51,598
the very beginning there's been this

1201
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,519
connection between horizontal transfer

1202
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,480
and the formation of metabolic Gene

1203
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,239
clusters I think is really

1204
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,000
interesting um short answer is yes we

1205
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:04,199
are really interested in other metabolic

1206
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,519
Gene clusters that are found on uh on

1207
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:09,679
Starships these are two that we know the

1208
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:11,639
products of in aspila Godus you can

1209
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,318
see those they're actually outlined here

1210
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,879
in white over here all these different

1211
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,358
fopid so you can see that there's

1212
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,039
actually a lot of other cargo that's

1213
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,000
included in addition to these particular

1214
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,759
clusters but certainly there's been a

1215
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
lot of interest in the fungal genomics

1216
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,920
World in understanding how different

1217
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,440
clusters end up different places know

1218
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,720
that they're frequently horizontally

1219
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,440
transferred now we can actually begin to

1220
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:36,358
understand a little bit more

1221
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,798
mechanistically why they're horizontally

1222
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:40,639
transferred or what conditions induce

1223
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:42,358
transfer right is it related to the

1224
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:46,279
actual function of the cluster itself

1225
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:50,679
for example um yeah questions like

1226
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:52,400
that yes um so regarding the 11 Gene

1227
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,719
families that you found star chips in

1228
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,079
yeah uh to this point how much of that

1229
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:01,199
result do you think think is due to the

1230
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,200
fact that those are heavily annotated

1231
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:06,759
Gene families or that are particularly

1232
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,759
relevant and we have a lot of genomic

1233
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,358
sequences yes that's a really great

1234
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,798
question so like any any so the question

1235
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,000
sorry I have a lot of things to keep

1236
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:18,440
track here between the cursor and

1237
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,798
repeating the the question

1238
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,358
stff think you're quickly seeing how I'm

1239
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:26,000
very bad at multitasking but so the

1240
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:28,358
question is how much might um bias in

1241
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,039
our genomic databases be impacting our

1242
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:37,358
assessments of tyrosine recom diversity

1243
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:39,239
um I will say so very quickly one of the

1244
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,358
more frustrating aspects of one of the

1245
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:44,000
roadblocks in studying these elements

1246
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:46,078
was that the tirene recombinase itself

1247
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,400
is often quartly annotated in a lot of

1248
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,280
automated pipelines so the first step of

1249
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,798
the tool that I

1250
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,079
developed just takes a denovo approach

1251
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:57,679
to just annotating them and not relying

1252
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,359
on a priori information so I would say

1253
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,000
we have a really good sense of the tyros

1254
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,159
or common ases themselves but then there

1255
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,519
is still that question of bias in the

1256
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:09,279
genomes that are available for us to

1257
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:11,280
look at I will say that um that's

1258
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,240
certainly something we're thinking about

1259
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,839
when it comes to trying to understand

1260
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:19,399
where starships are found in what fungal

1261
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:22,759
lineages because yes they're found

1262
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:25,559
mostly in Poma but also most fungal

1263
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,280
genome sequences are from the Poma as

1264
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:31,160
well right so I am going to be really

1265
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,000
interested to see whether or not this

1266
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,358
pattern holds true as more genomes are

1267
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,440
sequenced what I can say for sure is

1268
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,960
that starships are not in yeast we have

1269
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,880
a lot of really great East genomes and

1270
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,599
there's just no evidence of Starships in

1271
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,079
yeast it seem to mostly just be in

1272
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,599
filamentous

1273
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,798
fungi yeah you have sense of the

1274
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:53,920
mechanism by which Starships acquire

1275
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:56,759
their cargo and how uh like like is it

1276
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,798
usually like a like single cenic block

1277
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,040
of genes that corresponds to a segment

1278
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:04,920
of like a fungal genome or there

1279
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:08,599
multiple CTIC segments that type thing

1280
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,119
yeah so the question is how do Starships

1281
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:13,960
acquire new cargo how does the cow get

1282
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,720
Its Spots right so the

1283
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,480
question kind of answered here I think

1284
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,519
when you start aligning starships that

1285
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,838
maybe share different um parts of their

1286
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:26,519
cargo with each other in some cases like

1287
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:28,599
between myate and Prometheus there's

1288
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,759
evidence that maybe it was some sort of

1289
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:34,480
intra element Rec combination event that

1290
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,559
happened um possibly resulting in the

1291
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,400
exchange of a larger segment of cargo

1292
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,559
over time though with selection If there

1293
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,358
really is just selection you know for

1294
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,079
this particular phenotype you might

1295
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:48,400
expect other parts of that to have been

1296
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,519
lost so maybe that's why we see really

1297
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,519
the only regions being shared in some

1298
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:57,880
cases here just being really kind of

1299
00:52:53,519 --> 00:53:00,838
restricted to the cluster itself um

1300
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,240
we know that Starships can Nest within

1301
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:05,119
each other so that appears to be maybe

1302
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:08,159
one way that car cargo could be

1303
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,280
exchanged between different elements we

1304
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,078
think recombination is

1305
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,040
important um but beyond that we really

1306
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,400
don't know whether there are particular

1307
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:20,358
genetic features associated with

1308
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,680
starships that maybe predispose them to

1309
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:25,679
acquiring cargo from other parts of the

1310
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,480
genome or from other Starships as well

1311
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:31,598
but we know that those types of

1312
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,400
sequences or is elements um in bacteria

1313
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,280
exist so we would predict that maybe

1314
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,280
something similar is going

1315
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,559
on yes question you mentioned that uh

1316
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,519
stash typically have more copy

1317
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:49,519
number although You observe like some

1318
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:53,679
have multip copy number so I Wasing plan

1319
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:55,199
to investigate what mechanism cop number

1320
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,719
how does that

1321
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,318
affect yeah so the question is uh do we

1322
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:04,679
have any plans to understand how copy

1323
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:08,318
number control is enforced in fungal

1324
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:10,519
genomes and we have no plans to do it

1325
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:12,318
but we're really interested in in

1326
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:14,920
understanding how that might happen

1327
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:17,159
right whether it's host controlled or

1328
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,159
whether it's through some mechanism that

1329
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:22,039
might be encoded on the Starship so over

1330
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,719
time you might have you might expect

1331
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:27,318
there would be selection for elements

1332
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,879
that maybe minimize the detrimental

1333
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:31,519
impact they have on their particular

1334
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,760
host kind of like thinking about host

1335
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,400
parasite or host viral coevolution over

1336
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,640
time you get a less you get you get the

1337
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,760
evolution of a virus or sequence that's

1338
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:44,078
just more able to persist within a host

1339
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,440
um don't know if that's something

1340
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,839
similar going on

1341
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,358
here question in the back so if I if I

1342
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:54,279
caught this right there's subset of

1343
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:58,039
genes on the mobile elements that are

1344
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,240
core genes from the p analysis and I'm

1345
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:02,639
wondering are there does that tend to be

1346
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:06,279
a common theme between

1347
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,598
Starships um and do those genes are any

1348
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,760
of them known to be essential and if so

1349
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,559
is that like a mechanism of kind of

1350
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,040
vertical uh stability for it through

1351
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:19,798
about propagation the question is in

1352
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,440
some cases there are core genes that are

1353
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:25,679
located on Starships and is there any

1354
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,920
evidence that their core presence

1355
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,919
absence pattern PS are somehow Rel

1356
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,119
linked to an essential

1357
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:37,960
function no I have no yeah I have no

1358
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,720
idea um uh I will say you know like any

1359
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:44,000
analysis certainly a Pang genome

1360
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:45,919
analysis what is core um in one

1361
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,039
particular data set could ultimately end

1362
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,838
up to be you know accessory as you add

1363
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,680
more and more genomes not sure if that's

1364
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:52,880
the case with these particular genes but

1365
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:55,159
when we look at their functions we have

1366
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,240
no idea what they're doing or whether or

1367
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:58,239
not they are essential

1368
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,639
I think maybe have any questions on the

1369
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:08,119
zoom none that I can see okay um so

1370
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,639
let's thank our speaker again and we're

1371
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:13,920
gonna have the uh student and po launch

1372
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,920
up okay great

1373
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,759
thank this has been a production of

1374
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,760
