1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,160
I thank you Tony for that nice

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,460
introduction and thank you again for the

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,170
opportunity to come in and talk today as

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,769
Tony said this has kind of been

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,980
something that's been ruminating at

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,670
least for me for longer than I've known

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,769
Tony this is actually like a five year

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,320
going on longer type of thing so I want

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,488
to I don't want to

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,390
dive into too much that right now

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,399
because that's part of my presentation

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,590
but just again I want to thank you for

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,170
this chance to talk to you and like Tony

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,940
said oh really we're really looking for

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,880
feedback so even if you don't have

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,640
something now today you think something

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,600
we'd be happy to hear from you so I'll

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,600
go ahead and get started here

21
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,280
and I just want to just give a little

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,839
outline of what I'm going to talk about

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,719
today so you can kind of follow me

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,489
through this and this is for the

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
presentation I'm going to give a little

26
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,629
background and

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,509
you know and before just jumping right

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,929
into this I thought it'd be helpful if I

29
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:15,329
told you how I got to where I am with

30
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:17,549
this and how we how we got to thinking

31
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,590
about this at least how I did so I'm

32
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,478
going to talk about thought process my

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,500
thought process because for those of you

34
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,759
who are in graduate school right now

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,728
you're having all kinds of thoughts or

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,259
maybe you having no thoughts but at some

37
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,239
point if you stay in this business long

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,159
enough you're going to put those

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,589
thoughts together and this could be a

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,629
way to go to kind of see that process so

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,368
and I'll talk about some time points as

42
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,649
we go along then we hit hit the key

43
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,259
research papers that kind of where I

44
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,329
found really underpin this this

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,789
framework that I'm going to present to

46
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,829
you developing the framework looking at

47
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,390
our conceptual models testing the models

48
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,759
and they're talking about how that

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,310
relates to future directions with this

50
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,560
framework and again when I get to this

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,539
part this is a really a collaborative

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,030
effort between Tony and another faculty

53
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,679
member at

54
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,169
Trinity Western University David

55
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,930
Clements and so those two guys have been

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,718
helpful in this process too so first of

57
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,909
all the thought process so

58
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:19,250
thinking broadly broadly thinking okay

59
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:21,500
that's kind of a

60
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,139
I don't know an oxymoron but you just

61
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,949
kind of ruminate on that and really when

62
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:30,739
we talk about thought processes there's

63
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:33,139
one of two ways and I realize I'm

64
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,820
probably maybe categorizing them too

65
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,429
narrowly but in I'm just going to talk

66
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,489
about there's the reduction approach and

67
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,219
that's looking at the idea of reducing

68
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,620
complex interactions and entities to the

69
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:48,080
sum of their constituent parts in order

70
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,730
to make them easier to study so we break

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,100
things down you might work at the

72
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:54,709
cellular level you might look at one

73
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,650
species that that has a role in

74
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,580
different areas ok that's a reductionist

75
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,500
type of thought process there's also the

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,880
reverse of that is the holistic

77
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,289
referring to a big picture mentality in

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,870
which a person recognizes the

79
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:11,060
interconnectedness of various elements

80
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,939
that form larger systems patterns and

81
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,469
objects so now we're going to the big

82
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,389
picture scale where you're looking at

83
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:19,849
systems and how to different parts work

84
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,250
in these systems so the question is can

85
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,419
you do both and

86
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,900
that's something that I've wrestled with

87
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,000
for many years okay so I'm going to talk

88
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,599
about some of the time points in my

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,090
career about where I think my thought

90
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,519
process has crystallized on different

91
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,680
areas okay so I'm going to go back to

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,900
graduate school uses University Khalid a

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,790
California Davis as Tony mentioned I

94
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,590
have a PhD in soil and biogeochemistry

95
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:51,078
and everyone has that one course maybe

96
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,140
have more than one course but you have

97
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,280
the one course that really challenges

98
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,929
you makes you think

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,610
engages you in some way so I had that

100
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,069
one course now there's I had multiple

101
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,280
course but this course was soil science

102
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,400
105 and this is a field course in the

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
summer it was three weeks actually more

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,409
than three weeks but we went out all

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,840
over California and if you know anything

106
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:21,199
about California it actually has all 12

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,659
soil orders in the state so we were able

108
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,550
to see all 12 of these on this tour and

109
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,560
so you can see you know whether we are

110
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,050
up in the mountains in the snow whether

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,038
we were out in the desert whether we

112
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,740
were in a pit in the forest areas so

113
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,829
here I am you know I don't know if I'm

114
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,439
meditating or taking notes here is

115
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:47,918
definitely meditated shot but you know

116
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,180
we're on some pretty high elevation and

117
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,370
this group you've really kind of

118
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,610
coalesce as a group and you really start

119
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,530
to exchange ideas thoughts not just you

120
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,050
know during this this kind of field

121
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:02,719
presentation time and so the motto was

122
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,970
no whining adventure and always move

123
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,889
forward

124
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,259
okay so here's why you should take the

125
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,819
class and I think every good professor

126
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:12,949
has a reason why you should take the

127
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,500
course so here was the description and

128
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,030
they're really what I highlight is we

129
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,970
can never duplicate what you will see

130
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:21,709
and learn in the field so there thrust

131
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,550
was you need to get out and experience

132
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:28,120
it okay so did I do it once no I did it

133
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,829
twice because I just couldn't get enough

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,649
okay so that's the first time point that

135
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,168
I think I really was now challenging my

136
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,779
thinking okay so let's move forward to I

137
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:41,269
as Tony mentioned I did a postdoc at

138
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,279
Washington State University and here's

139
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,348
where kind of the outside the box

140
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,069
thinking really started materialized

141
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:50,689
where I was working at a center for

142
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:53,089
precision agricultural and automated

143
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:55,668
systems so completely different from my

144
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:58,459
graduate school training this is where

145
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:01,069
engineers get together and they create

146
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:04,370
these machines that do all kinds of wild

147
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,199
stuff okay so I thought well how do we

148
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,360
apply that to weeds and weed management

149
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,319
well our traditional approach is the

150
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,990
combination of the various methods and

151
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,728
and now that we have technology and i'm

152
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,210
not talking about biotechnology but

153
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:21,800
technology sensors automation now we can

154
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,959
think about removing the spatial

155
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,810
temporal constraints and combining the

156
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,959
biology with the technology so i've

157
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,908
written a paper i got a many different

158
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,430
authors together and we wrote a book on

159
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:36,680
this topic about the future we control

160
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,870
and cropping systems okay so this was

161
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,288
another kind of galvanizing period we're

162
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,899
okay now this is another thought process

163
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:48,418
so then I went to university Nebraska

164
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,848
assistant professor a lot of energy a

165
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:53,278
lot of enthusiasm I was really excited

166
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:56,269
about getting a program going and I

167
00:06:53,278 --> 00:07:00,718
heard about the NSF career program and

168
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:02,990
that to me was a golden opportunity at

169
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:06,808
least what I thought to really

170
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,538
put forward an idea and take it to a

171
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:10,770
level of adding the theory and the

172
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,168
things that I thought were really

173
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:15,058
valuable in look at and invasive plants

174
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:17,068
the ecology the evolution and that kind

175
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:20,419
of thing so I looked into this program

176
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:23,520
i'm sure everyone knows about it and

177
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:25,218
so i should also say at that same time I

178
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,299
was working on

179
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:31,800
invasive plants out in the in the

180
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,059
environment and in 2012 Nebraska was in

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,259
one of these highlighted colors where

182
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,300
extreme or exceptional drought was

183
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,379
occurring okay so I was thinking about

184
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,908
that I was thinking about invasive

185
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,419
plants the environment okay how are

186
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:47,449
these things kind of working together

187
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:49,740
went ahead and

188
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:52,050
submitted a proposal like an invasive

189
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,999
plant species response to extreme

190
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,978
weather events and this is just a little

191
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:58,110
snapshot the intellectual merit part of

192
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,240
it what were we doing we're looking at

193
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,949
phenotypic characterization and genetic

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,709
markers associated with plant growth and

195
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,889
reproduction invasives versus natives

196
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:10,889
and looking at this hour star model that

197
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,439
was first proposed by Tillman where the

198
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,028
where the the most competitive species

199
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,119
is the one with the lowest resource

200
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:19,978
requirement and we wanted to develop

201
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:21,659
greater understanding of how native and

202
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:24,598
invasive plant species differ in their

203
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,579
adaptation in these new and existing

204
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,588
environments especially where drought

205
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:30,149
was occurring so really excited about

206
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:32,099
this i went to to grant writing

207
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,870
workshops talked to the people said you

208
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,689
know is this right am i on track got a

209
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,778
lot of reviews on it

210
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:43,528
k little roadblock here do not fund all

211
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:45,809
right everyone said that so there was

212
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:48,750
nothing fundamentally wrong it was just

213
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:51,119
you know you got to be exceptional of

214
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:55,409
the exception of the i should say

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,720
outstanding okay so who cares just keep

216
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,250
going with this so

217
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,889
Oh

218
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,318
regardless I have looked at a lot of

219
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:07,350
different proposals this is just a list

220
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:09,899
which any faculty member i'm sure has

221
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,790
the same list or longer it's interesting

222
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,889
i was talking to a colleague who's now

223
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:16,049
at administrative level and he said you

224
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,399
know I've still got boxes of proposals

225
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:19,469
back in the day when you had to actually

226
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,379
write and some and you know send it in

227
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:28,170
by paper so so this is just showing you

228
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:30,269
that the thought process hadn't stopped

229
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,799
even though I didn't get funded even

230
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,789
though it was kind of a letdown the

231
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:38,519
thought process didn't quit okay

232
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:41,458
so here we are this everyone for those

233
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,740
of you coffee aficionados you know

234
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:47,039
here's the the percolating coffee pot

235
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,110
okay here's this is my brain a pot of

236
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,688
coffee and it's percolating over the

237
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,949
stove with all these ideas you know I've

238
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:57,838
been exposed to starting graduate school

239
00:09:54,948 --> 00:10:00,359
you know everything's going and I'm

240
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,579
wondering are we going to get to this

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,870
nice cup of coffee well well the jury's

242
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,088
still out on that we haven't I haven't

243
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,578
reached that point but hopefully with

244
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,189
what you see today there's maybe we're

245
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,870
getting towards this point okay so let's

246
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:17,719
go back to the Alice oh look at let's

247
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,679
now move into the

248
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,778
where we're looking at this framework

249
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,539
and looking at what are the key research

250
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,879
papers okay so I'm going to hit on three

251
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,649
papers there's multiple papers out there

252
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,459
on invasion biology but I'm going to

253
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:34,860
focus on three that I think really are

254
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:37,409
applicable to what I was trying to do

255
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,419
and now what I've been working with my

256
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:41,879
colleagues

257
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:44,519
Tony and David okay so looking at this

258
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,500
paper paper by a Peter Albert at UMass

259
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,120
on invasiveness invasive ility in the

260
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,639
role environmental stress and the spread

261
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,100
of non-native plants okay so what they

262
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,740
were looking at was invasiveness of the

263
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,990
specie versus invasive ility of the

264
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,938
habitat and it's really challenging to

265
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,089
identify traits of invasive plants

266
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,870
because they're different they do

267
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,649
different things in different

268
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,808
environments the habitat type is a

269
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,129
little bit I wouldn't say easier but

270
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:15,809
more realistic in how to we quantify it

271
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,549
so they're looking at factors and they

272
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,009
identified competition intensity

273
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:21,209
disturbance regimes environmental stress

274
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,580
and I'm not going to go into a lot of

275
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,470
this but just highlight the thing that

276
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,070
they focused on was the environmental

277
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,620
stress and vase ability so here's just a

278
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,270
little

279
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,850
diagram this is their conceptual model

280
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,620
the difference between these two is this

281
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,230
is cases in which high stress should

282
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,049
decrease in vase ability and this is

283
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,330
where cases of high stress should

284
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,949
increase in vase ability and this is

285
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,110
just conceptual this is what they were

286
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,740
thinking it's not based on empirical

287
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,709
studies so looking at case whoops case

288
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,889
one here we are high stress will kill

289
00:11:55,708 --> 00:12:00,588
the non-native case to the non-natives

290
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,720
are

291
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:06,270
competitively inferior at maximum stress

292
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,310
levels and then case three the

293
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,069
non-natives are slightly competitive at

294
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,349
superior slightly more superior at high

295
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,230
stress levels looking at at the other

296
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,110
other where we have increased in vase

297
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,278
ability

298
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,740
case one is non-natives are

299
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,230
competitively inferior at low stress so

300
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,209
where there's low stress and then the

301
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,940
case five non-natives are competitively

302
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,549
superior at all stress levels okay so

303
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,640
we've got that there next I'm going to

304
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:38,689
jump to this paper by own at all

305
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,759
and they were looking at

306
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,250
invasion success affected by factors

307
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,139
okay so you're hearing this factor term

308
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,220
I want you to remember that because I'm

309
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,028
going to we're going to hit on that

310
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,870
again so looking at their focus was this

311
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:56,458
migration factor when does something in

312
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,100
invade or when does it first come into

313
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,019
the community and then what happens and

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,149
so looking at ecological and

315
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,100
evolutionary changes so they came up

316
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,620
with some invasion scenarios showing how

317
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,220
the factors contributed to invader and

318
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,919
habitat match and here's a diagram from

319
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,690
their paper and I'll just walk you

320
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,269
through this a little bit here is on the

321
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,190
the

322
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:22,620
x-axis here sorry y axis characteristics

323
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,610
of the invaded areas and of the invasive

324
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,820
species

325
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,720
on the x axis we have time and the

326
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,480
invaded area that's this dotted line the

327
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,660
invasive species is the solid line the

328
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,019
migration so when it's introduced is the

329
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,809
arrow and then when the invasion process

330
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:46,220
starts is the vertical line on the time

331
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:48,599
axis so they have four scenarios

332
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,278
this first one is only a change in the

333
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,629
migration regime is needed to initiate

334
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,828
invasion so that's pretty simple

335
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,950
invasion begins after change in

336
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,919
innovated area okay so if we look at the

337
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:04,528
invaded area something's going on and

338
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,689
then at this point the invasion process

339
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,549
actually starts if you flip that around

340
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,990
looking at the invader now there's

341
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,759
something going on here and then at this

342
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,190
point the invasion actually starts and

343
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,659
then finally at the the scenario d where

344
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,300
they had a change in migration and

345
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:20,819
invaded area needed to initiate the

346
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:23,009
invasion and so they talk about several

347
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,980
examples about where this occur where

348
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:30,000
this could occur okay so the last paper

349
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,539
is one by Jessica gurvich at Stony Brook

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,980
and she she and her colleagues are

351
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:39,480
looking at kind of synthesizing where

352
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,699
where we are with biological invasions

353
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,949
so kind of this big picture look at

354
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,289
things and so they came up with this

355
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:49,319
conceptual synthetic invasion meta

356
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:51,929
framework real tongue twister but they

357
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,690
defined they just simple simple fight to

358
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:58,009
sim where the unifying principles of

359
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,449
ecology in evolutionary biology and

360
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,970
really what they were trying to focus on

361
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:05,759
was the

362
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:08,399
this demography of invasions where they

363
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,069
occur and then looking at through these

364
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,419
three characteristics and I'm going to

365
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,040
touch on this a little bit because those

366
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,948
are kind of fundamental for our

367
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,919
framework where it's looking at rapid

368
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:21,088
local population increase

369
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,539
monocultures or local dominance and

370
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,790
range expansion and so they looked at

371
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,500
the literature kind of summarized the

372
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,448
different models that were out there and

373
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,669
they came up with their model to help

374
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:38,339
kind of push us along with quantifying

375
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:42,509
and testing the evaluation of these

376
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:45,560
causal factors so here's a picture

377
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:49,110
cartoon of their figure where they've

378
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:51,509
shown that the sim can be applied to

379
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:55,620
this simple case of enemy escape it's a

380
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:59,970
in this invasion theory where the

381
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,210
invader demography then relates to this

382
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,200
population interactions and going

383
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,330
through this affects these different

384
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,950
invasion components

385
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,470
you flip it around a little bit where

386
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,810
it's applied now to the the example of

387
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,330
ecological and evolutionary components

388
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:21,659
and this is related to propagule

389
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,460
pressure and here we have basically

390
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:27,750
looking at human impacts and how they're

391
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,220
related to this process which relates to

392
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,220
invader demography and then again

393
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,590
affecting these two different components

394
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,450
and then finally this is where they

395
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,090
apply it to the the evolution of

396
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,730
increased competitive ability where that

397
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,850
theory is the the invasive plant is

398
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,310
released from its constraints in the new

399
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:50,370
environment and so they apply their

400
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:52,129
model to how this might this scenario

401
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,539
might work out and how it would affect

402
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:57,539
again this rapid population increased

403
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,059
and domination mode and the dominant

404
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,679
monoculture

405
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,659
okay so like I said those are three

406
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,779
papers there are several others and

407
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:10,109
these are just some examples of really

408
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,789
some kind of primary or really key

409
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:15,948
papers that have been published on this

410
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:18,299
kind of modeling looking at how do we

411
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,959
understand the theory of invasive ility

412
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:25,259
whether this paper by Davis catford at

413
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,439
all did a nice study on looking at

414
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:31,980
invasion ecology and a theoretical

415
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,529
framework I just want to point out this

416
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,089
one by Baniyas really a nice paper

417
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,339
integrating an assessment of biological

418
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,149
invasions so not just plants but we're

419
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,730
looking across the wider

420
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,330
context so these are papers that could

421
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,319
be you know you looked at as well

422
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:51,609
but now I want to talk a little bit

423
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,339
about what we did as far as develop our

424
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:57,490
framework

425
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:59,799
so you're kind of getting used to this

426
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,750
paper thing okay so Kohler and lodge as

427
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:07,180
as a paper that talks about

428
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,690
looking at the the establishment so

429
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,480
invasive plants established in going

430
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,450
through this

431
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,069
kind of scenario and

432
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,100
it's important to understand that a lot

433
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:22,359
of invasive plants

434
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,509
they might be introduced but they don't

435
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,659
always establish and so what these what

436
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:31,539
they did was

437
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:34,029
kind of describe this in a way of where

438
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:36,159
these points of failure could be so a

439
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:39,279
species that's entrained in the

440
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,220
transport pathway whether it's brought

441
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,819
over an ocean whether it's transported

442
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,750
across a region

443
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,700
oftentimes there's a failure in the

444
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,460
transport okay if it survives the

445
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,200
transport in and adduction

446
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,519
the it failed to establish maybe the

447
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,279
conditions aren't right maybe it's

448
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,950
competitive maybe there's a disturbance

449
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,549
factor that's limiting that that puffs

450
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,680
you know that that ability when it does

451
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:07,509
establish

452
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,240
sometimes it still remains non-invasive

453
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:12,460
you can see weeds and vase of plants

454
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,759
that do establish but they're not a

455
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,860
problem they don't reach this final

456
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,140
stage where they're spreading and that's

457
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:23,559
where they become invasive and I think

458
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,600
I've read a report I the kind of the

459
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,339
ballpark is ten percent of plants

460
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,709
actually become invasive so the ones

461
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:31,509
that we have that's ten percent of all

462
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,759
the ones that are really that have been

463
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:36,629
introduced

464
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:39,519
okay so that's this kind of structure

465
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,190
but then for for what we were looking at

466
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,200
again I'm going to go back to the

467
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,980
components that that gurevich had all

468
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:51,069
talked about because we really focused

469
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,250
on this framework in the context of

470
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,710
these three components so rapid

471
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,230
population increase and this is where

472
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,590
populations increase exponentially so

473
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,558
whether that's at a

474
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:06,509
you know a single starting from a single

475
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,349
plant or multiple plants there's this

476
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:11,639
rapid increase and also an established

477
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:14,339
local dominant so where there's

478
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:16,829
monocultures that are created with

479
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,918
limited or no diversity and that can

480
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:21,928
occur at again scales of small local too

481
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,090
large but then we get to range expansion

482
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,950
where there's a dispersal from local

483
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:28,288
populations occurring in these

484
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,840
transition under servant zones okay so

485
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:33,210
that's kind of this

486
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,959
invasion process now these stages don't

487
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,610
always occur

488
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,409
chronologically they might occur

489
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:43,079
simultaneously

490
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:44,519
but typically that's the process so

491
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,658
that's the best of those the stages that

492
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:51,298
are that are included okay so next

493
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:52,769
the goal that we had was really we're

494
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,519
not trying to predict how and where

495
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:58,740
invasions will occur which a lot of

496
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:02,329
models do but instead we're using these

497
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:06,089
three main factors of resident community

498
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:07,980
the invader fitness and whether to guide

499
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:10,220
and develop our understanding of why

500
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,950
invasions occur

501
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,778
so these three main factors on this that

502
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,019
we've kind of included on our framework

503
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:20,250
is the resident community so what are

504
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,079
some things that are part of the

505
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,589
resident clean obviously there's other

506
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,740
plants there are the micro and macro

507
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:31,558
fauna there's nutrient soil type there's

508
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,870
a lot of different parts of the resident

509
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,480
community that are factoring into the

510
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:38,849
invasion process and and again this is

511
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,649
probably simplified to some degree but

512
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:44,278
it's a starting point of where we're

513
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:47,689
going invader fitness so how does the

514
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:50,190
invasive species respond what is the

515
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,879
what are the things such as the

516
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,490
plasticity of the plant

517
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:58,949
you know whether it's able to adapt what

518
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,878
is the genetic selection of the plants

519
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,129
that are there how are they fit to adapt

520
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:07,648
to those

521
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:10,408
the new environment or the new habitats

522
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:12,859
there that they're introduced to and

523
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:15,809
then finally the weather factor

524
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:17,699
that has been really important

525
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,279
especially as we see these new extreme

526
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,049
conditions occur but not just extreme

527
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,759
highs and lows also the normal

528
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:28,740
conditions 30 year averages not just

529
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:31,680
averages but frequency and duration how

530
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,809
frequent are these events occurring what

531
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,019
is the duration and of course the

532
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:39,059
effects of different

533
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:41,569
in this case a co2 concentration but

534
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,849
even other gases other other

535
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:47,429
weather-related

536
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:50,429
factors okay so we've got factors we've

537
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,769
got this kind of invasion framework

538
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,240
where we've got these components the

539
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,670
factors are contributing to the

540
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,170
components

541
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,380
so now what we were going to do now what

542
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,460
we did was we went to the literature and

543
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,940
look for empirical research that would

544
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,430
help us to build our conceptual model to

545
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,200
show exactly how resident community

546
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,210
invader fitness and weather influence

547
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:21,029
the invasion process ok so we identified

548
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:24,620
three invasive plant species and we

549
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:27,809
chose these based on their

550
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:29,669
known kind of well known where they've

551
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:33,179
been where they're distributed across

552
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:36,269
the regions or across the country at

553
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,970
least as far as in this country and then

554
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,680
we looked at the number of published

555
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,230
empirical studies for each of the

556
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,380
factors and so these are the number of

557
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,380
papers that were identified again these

558
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:55,970
are empirical studies with data that we

559
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:58,230
could use to evaluate as far as their

560
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,210
contribution to these different factors

561
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,130
and ultimately to this invasion and

562
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,809
factor framework so we chose yellow

563
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,300
starthistle non-native common read

564
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,309
muscle I actually also have worked with

565
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,159
these plant species so there's there's a

566
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,690
little bit of a bias there

567
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,730
but the point is we've identified these

568
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,500
species and what we hope to do when we

569
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,230
get done is you could substitute any

570
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,869
invasive plant species and run that

571
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,940
through this model to see what the what

572
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:26,299
the outcome is

573
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,269
okay so just an example this is just a

574
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:32,210
the top line of

575
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:34,480
of one of the tables and this is for

576
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,309
yellow starthistle

577
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,950
so here's the reference paper by brown

578
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:44,889
and rice in 2010 and here are the

579
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,870
resident community factor

580
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,750
the the four things that we've kind of

581
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:53,889
grouped these into as far as did this

582
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,950
paper address one of these

583
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,870
subcategories in the factors and

584
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,210
we also looked for if there were other

585
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:04,250
things

586
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:07,400
related to resident plant community in

587
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:10,460
this in addition to these other four and

588
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,040
then what we did was assess what was the

589
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,950
invasion component that was affected so

590
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,920
there was three components and we tried

591
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,200
to quantify was it most affecting the

592
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,410
rapid population increase local

593
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,460
dominance or range expansion so for this

594
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:31,130
paper we were able to assess it as rapid

595
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,620
population increase okay so looking at

596
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,270
Phragmites

597
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:38,479
same thing resident community oh and i

598
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,460
should also note the remaining papers

599
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,579
were categorized into this table as well

600
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,079
as the two others

601
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:48,859
invader fitness and weather so we had a

602
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:50,059
total of nine tables that we categorize

603
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,769
the papers i'm not going to show you

604
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,109
those all those tables right now because

605
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:55,009
it would put you to sleep and I want to

606
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:57,439
just get through this a little bit

607
00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:00,220
quicker so here's a paper by song at all

608
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,570
again these were the

609
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,009
summarizing what were the things that

610
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,139
they looked at under these different

611
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,269
categories and then here is where we

612
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:13,900
assess what was the invasion component

613
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,900
affected and then finally for muscle

614
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,730
actually a lot of work has been done on

615
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,920
muscle by a person at Penn State really

616
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,650
done a nice job of looking at all the

617
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,970
different factors of muscle this is an

618
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,040
example of some of her work with a

619
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,710
graduate student looking at simulated

620
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:33,019
grazing then they also look at pasture

621
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,049
grasses in old fields and how there was

622
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:40,029
competition and we assessed that is

623
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:42,919
establishing local dominance okay so

624
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:44,190
looking at our tables we then took this

625
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,710
in information from the invasion

626
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:50,940
component that was affected and we used

627
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,710
it in this conceptual model okay so I so

628
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,600
so now we're going to go to looking at

629
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,600
how we're testing this conceptual model

630
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,159
and we wanted to summarize the empirical

631
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,949
studies on our three example invasive

632
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,050
plant species to contextualize our

633
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,870
invasion factor framework so we're using

634
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,539
these what was the invasion component

635
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:13,489
affected from the category and and

636
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:17,430
putting it into this model so here's our

637
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:20,039
figure and this is again this is looking

638
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,980
at the influence of the component in

639
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,159
limiting the invasion success so here's

640
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,150
just one this is the weather factor and

641
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,580
here's for our different our three

642
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:33,840
species muscle Phragmites and yellow

643
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:35,669
starthistle and then along the x axis we

644
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,250
have rap rapid population increase

645
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:40,710
increased local dominance rapid range

646
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,539
expansion and that's from our framework

647
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,660
so these are the components of invasion

648
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:48,990
success and from what we can see this is

649
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:51,720
very kind of generalized but looking at

650
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:54,509
our example invasive species extreme

651
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,610
weather in this case limits invasions

652
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:59,269
success primarily by affecting the rapid

653
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:02,629
range expansion components so out here

654
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:06,329
we see that the

655
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,790
that this this was most limiting to

656
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:11,970
these three species now we can say

657
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:13,349
different things about this established

658
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,690
local dominance and rapid population

659
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,250
increase because obviously you know

660
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,170
these they're not all at the same level

661
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,809
and and star thistle was affected across

662
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,150
all the different components of the

663
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:27,329
invasion process but what's really

664
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,660
interesting is the current predictive

665
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,720
models would suggest otherwise so what

666
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:37,070
we've seen what we summarized

667
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,900
empirically from empirical studies

668
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:41,490
doesn't necessarily match up what's with

669
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,930
what's being predicted and I think

670
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,789
that's one of the interesting things

671
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,940
that we found out with this and that's

672
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,869
for this weather factor

673
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,000
but like I said I'm not going to go

674
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:53,489
through all the different figures right

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,220
now I just want to kind of bring this

676
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,370
back and show where we're at with this

677
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,009
by looking that these recent conceptual

678
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,929
models broadly synthesized concepts and

679
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,400
theory to test hypotheses improve

680
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,870
understanding and identify research

681
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,750
directions so that's kind of the big

682
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:12,689
picture well the reductionist approach

683
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,549
has focused on things like fluctuating

684
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,580
resource availability invader and

685
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,960
resident community

686
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:21,839
introduce native ranges and then these

687
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,970
current future climate conditions so our

688
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,009
invasion factor framework combines the

689
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,370
factors affecting the invasion process

690
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:31,799
and synthesizes it into a framework so

691
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:34,919
we're trying to bring both of these

692
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:37,559
together to better understand for a

693
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,800
particular invasive species why that's

694
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,509
been occurring ok so I'm going to jump

695
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,569
really quickly in here to future

696
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:47,970
directions

697
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:50,069
and talking about so I've thought back

698
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,079
to my thought process that I kind of

699
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:54,960
introduced earlier so how would this

700
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,480
guide research you know if I was to be

701
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,160
focused on research what would what

702
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,589
would this do for a research program

703
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,580
well if a person was looking at

704
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:07,889
individual invasive plant species

705
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:11,429
are there enough empirical studies on

706
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:13,610
the factor to be able to make an

707
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,670
assessment of it and

708
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:18,899
and in for some species may be there are

709
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,590
adequate number of empirical studies

710
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,930
maybe it's just been studied to death

711
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:27,720
but the lack of synthesis maybe it's not

712
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,180
been synthesized to say this is where

713
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,940
this

714
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:35,009
weakness is or this is where it's been a

715
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,660
real critical area that we have now been

716
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:39,210
able to understand with with the

717
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,160
research is available also an approach

718
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,809
for targeting specific management if you

719
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,060
know something specific maybe it's a

720
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,679
resident plant community effect maybe

721
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,359
it's an invader Fitness maybe it's

722
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,430
something to do with whether can you

723
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,309
target management to really address that

724
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:55,289
area and then also the thing that's

725
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,500
really fun is to address invasion

726
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,059
theories and really push that to see you

727
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,569
know where are we going to go with with

728
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:05,759
this thought process

729
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:08,339
so as I kind of alluded to this model

730
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,890
congruence where we've got this

731
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,029
empirically based conceptual models

732
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,240
and then we've got data driven

733
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,200
projection models and

734
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,089
Bethenny Bradley at University of

735
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,029
Massachusetts has done a lot of work on

736
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:22,439
kind of predicting different scenarios

737
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,660
different situations with invasive

738
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,809
plants

739
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:30,120
but can we bring these two together with

740
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:34,710
either companion studies verification

741
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,599
tools some way to say the the projection

742
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,630
is actually reflecting what the

743
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,189
empirical research is showing and that's

744
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,710
where I want to end with this the in son

745
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,170
this is a quote from her paper their

746
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,279
paper in 2009 the uncertainties

747
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,080
associated with changes in climate

748
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,389
vegetation communities and the response

749
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,250
of invasive plant species warrant an

750
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,840
urgent need for integrating modeling and

751
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,539
experimental work to better address the

752
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,149
ecological ramifications so I think that

753
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,519
really in a way summarizes at least for

754
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,050
this weather factor now we've got a lot

755
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,509
of other things that you know we can say

756
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:09,450
maybe similar things but you know can we

757
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:10,369
bring those two together to really move

758
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,049
this along

759
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:16,739
so with that I'd like to thank my

760

763
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:29,730
there's any questions thoughts comments

764
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:29,730
I think we have some time for it so yeah

765
