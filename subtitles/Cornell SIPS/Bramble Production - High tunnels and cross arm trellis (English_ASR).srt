1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,000
uh mode and our first speaker is Dr

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:20,320
Marvin pritz he is the um Department of

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,320
horiculture chair at Cornell University

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,800
and he has been the small fruit um

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,278
specialist for many years and has done a

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,920
lot of work with uh High tunnel growing

7
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,679
with raspberry Beres and blackberries

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
and Dr pritz I'm going to move it right

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,320
to you okay and it's really nice to see

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,760
so many people from so many different

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,359
places attend the webinar today and I'd

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,280
like to compliment Laura on scheduling a

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,558
meeting about keeping plants warm and

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,600
dry and probably the coldest day of the

15
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,078
year and maybe even a decade for some of

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,920
you uh we want to talk about producing

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,840
raspberries and blackberries out of

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,520
season using High tunnels and a little

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,000
bit of greenhouse most of this will

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,840
focus on high tunnels and there are lots

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,280
of reasons why uh we can use high

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,520
tunnels and green houses one is that we

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,599
can improve over wintering of our plants

24
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,239
which is probably going to be real

25
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,759
important this year our season is

26
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,640
extended so the fruits are worth more

27
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,239
fruit quality is higher and yields are

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,000
greater here's just a photo of uh some

29
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,798
thornless blackberries and some red

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,719
raspberries after winter and this often

31
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,118
happens in more Northern climates they

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,118
get killed by cold winter temperatures

33
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:31,560
the new Prime canes grow just fine but

34
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:34,519
the old canes

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,000
die the price off season if you can

36
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,879
somehow bring those crops on earlier or

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
uh produce them later can be quite High

38
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,199
here's a photograph I took from a

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,079
grocery store and you can see $4.99 for

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,040
a half pint of raspberries and $6.99 for

41
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,039
a half Pine of blackberries that's

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
pretty good

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
money High tunnels are being used all

44
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,158
around the world right now Spain and

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,399
Portugal uses them a lot Scotland uses

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,399
them and even California most of the

47
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,118
raspberries now are uh growing to crop

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,878
under these tunnels not so much for

49
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,479
warmth but just to keep the moisture off

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,840
the fruit the quality is so much better

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,439
when the raspberries don't get wet even

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,080
from Dew even if it doesn't rain so

53
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,479
these are taken off

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,879
everywhere uh California will even go to

55
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,518
the extent of putting up wind barricades

56
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,439
because we know that too much wind

57
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,480
damages raspberry plants as well and

58
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,079
this Farm here not only did they chalous

59
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,238
The Raspberries but they put up uh this

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,480
netting here to reduce the wind on the

61
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,840
plant so that they produce more ma

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:43,158
Marvin can I interrupt just for a second

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,439
I'm sorry um we are having a number of

64
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,158
people say that they don't see any

65
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,759
picture which is an a different um

66
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:55,079
problem than we've had before so I just

67
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,239
am wondering how is anybody able to see

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,519
the video

69
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,680
the okay we have some people that see it

70
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:08,400
and some people that don't

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,640
um okay good so perhaps it is taking a

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,799
while to load so thank you very much for

73
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,759
all of your comments um I am hopeful

74
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,959
that those of you that are not seeing it

75
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:25,759
that maybe it will load in a bit and

76
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:30,280
um oh uh okay there is somebody that

77
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:32,919
just said that um so David called you

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,878
have said that the Adobe presenter um

79
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,238
maybe it is loading it's just your

80
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,079
connection may not be fast enough and so

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,879
hopeful that you had you were supposed

83
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,039
to add a load in when you Lo when you

84
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,639
got onto the

85
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,078
program okay so I think it's just taking

86
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,158
a while for this presentation to load

87
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,599
I'm not sure why that is perhaps it's

88
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,000
frozen it's it's a big presentation too

89
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,759
there's lots of pictures so so let's

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,799
just give it a moment and hopefully

91
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:10,399
everybody is there okay

92
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,680
great um sorry sorry Marvin I'll let you

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,719
continue okay so if you can see the

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,400
photograph here you can see what can

95
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,519
happen to a tunnel if you have too much

96
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,918
wind and the wind can be damaging to the

97
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,959
uh tunnels if you don't manage them

98
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,159
correctly but the point I want to make

99
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,560
is that the tunnels are good for

100
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
temperature management moisture

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,519
management and wind management and and

102
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,719
our plants can really benefit from that

103
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,120
particularly here it says Northeast but

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,919
all throughout the Northern Tier of

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
States uh we have three reasons why we

106
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,918
could use tunnels and lots of other

107
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,719
places around the world only have one

108
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,198
reason and they use Tunnels for that one

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,840
reason we have all the possible reasons

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,720
to use a tunnel in our climate and so

111
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,918
we've been experimenting with different

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,280
ways of using tunnels to grow

113
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:59,319
raspberries off seon with higher

114
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,679
quality the first um plan I want to talk

115
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,240
about our fall fruiting raspberries

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,519
these are plants that produce fruit in

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,000
the first year canes they grow up they

118
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,758
flower in the late summer they produce

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,439
fruit in early fall and we can start

120
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,439
picking that fruit at least for us or

121
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,120
late August early September and as you

122
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,639
can see from

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,399
the figure here we start to pick in late

124
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,160
August we start picking up in September

125
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,318
and just about the time we get into full

126
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,600
production we get our first Frost at the

127
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,319
end of September early October

128
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,240
and uh we're done and that's a shame

129
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,520
because there's a lot more fruit on

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,160
those plants now one of the advantages

131
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,839
of a high tunnel is that we can continue

132
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,439
to pick that fruit even after the frost

133
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,478
comes now there are ways of accelerating

134
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,038
a harvest uh without using a high tunnel

135
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,519
and row covers are one way to do that so

136
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,318
when the plants first come out of the

137
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:58,079
ground you can cover them with a row

138
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,879
cover like you see here and that will

139
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,240
accelerate the growth and they'll

140
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:06,478
actually produce fruit earlier and yield

141
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,560
faster and when we've done that with

142
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,519
raspberries we can see that without a

143
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,800
cover this is our yield distribution and

144
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:18,758
a season these are days after August

145
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,400
10th when we put on a cover for April we

146
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,000
bring that crop on earlier and when we

147
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,638
put that cover on in March we can bring

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,279
it on even earlier though that's indeed

149
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,879
one way you can accelerate the Harvest

150
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,959
and bring that crop on before that Frost

151
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,478
comes but you have to do that one way at

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,399
a one row at a time and this is what we

153
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,199
used to do until the high tunnels came

154
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,679
along where we could cover you know at

155
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,199
least four rows at a time and it was

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,959
much more efficient at doing it that way

157
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
plus it was easier to pick the fruit

158
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,000
without having to deal with those

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,439
individual row covers so our first

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
strategy with the high tunnel was to

161
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,120
look at uh the thickness of the row

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,360
cover by the way was the 6 o per square

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,280
foot but it doesn't have to be a heavy

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,000
cover we actually looked at heavy and

165
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,519
lighter covers and it didn't make a

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,160
difference it just seemed like uh a row

167
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,719
cover worked and plastic over top of the

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,039
plants that load to the ground did not

169
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,240
work uh that actually probably made the

170
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,878
plants too hot and raspberries don't

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,478
like heat so A rad cover worked better

172
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,720
in that situation than a plastic cover

173
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,519
but when you go to a high tunnel the

174
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,440
tunnels are much higher and you get

175
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,560
ventilation and the temperatures don't

176
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,680
climb to nearly the level they do in a

177
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,598
tunnel as they would in a sheet of

178
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,879
plastic over a low growing

179
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:42,399
plant so uh the first strategy is to

180
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,360
look at these cultivars of raspberry and

181
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,198
actually maybe even try to delay Harvest

182
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,919
which we would never do in the field but

183
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,319
to try to get fruit later in the season

184
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,758
from when it's normally available so

185
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,680
here's one of our tunnels and it shows a

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,479
crop of Heritage Raspberry being

187
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,840
harvested the plants inside there look

188
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,918
beautiful they're vigorous there's lots

189
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,839
of fruit

190
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,598
but the date is October 20th and for

191
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,799
those of you who are from upstate New

192
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,719
York October 20th you know the leaves

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,280
are off the trees by then we've had

194
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,400
several hard Frost and plants outside

195
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,198
are done fruiting there's no fruit the

196
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,120
leaves are starting to drop but inside

197
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,280
the tunnel you can see we're just going

198
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
gang

199
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,719
busters Caroline is a good variety for

200
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,079
the high tunnel in mid- October you can

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
see the fruit looks really nice uh we

202
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,559
looked at a bunch of different varieties

203
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:35,879
to see which ones would do well for us

204
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,598
and we find that you know Heritage does

205
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,278
just great in a high tunnel Caroline

206
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,080
does great Autumn Britain was one we

207
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,958
tried it it's comes on early really well

208
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
but then it drops off pretty fast uh

209
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,159
Josephine is another variety that

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,920
actually comes on strong later and had

211
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,559
really good flavor and good size so this

212
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,078
is one that we can grow in a high tunnel

213
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,199
without any manipulation and get a

214
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:01,199
really nice late crop

215
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,839
here's just some yield data over a

216
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,078
couple of years of aut Britain and

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,240
Caroline Heritage and Josephine uh

218
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:15,159
looking at yields Carolina Heritage as I

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,799
mentioned before do really well Autumn

220
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:21,000
Britain not quite so well the one that

221
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,359
was impressive was Josephine not so much

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,679
because of Y but the berry size is

223
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,120
pretty remarkable the size of the fruit

224
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,838
is about twice the size of Heritage or

225
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,320
Caroline which is more or less our

226
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,519
standard and the flavor is amazing it's

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,160
really really good tastes like a really

228
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,879
strong great raspberry yeah and these

229
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,759
plants are all planted in ground just

230
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,519
like you would normally plant in the

231
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,559
field and I'll show you what we do here

232
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,399
in a

233
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,039
second but yeah they're just planted in

234
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,120
the ground and the tunnels are put up

235
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,759
over the

236
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,159
plants here's Heritage and compare that

237
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,838
to Josephine and you can look at the

238
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,039
weight on here and some of the berries

239
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,120
are coming off at over 7 gram a piece so

240
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,078
we're pretty excited about Josephine's

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,399
is a variety for late season one of the

242
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,239
things we wanted to do is have Heritage

243
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,200
come in later too because in the field

244
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,839
we don't want it later but in a tunnel

245
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,240
why not have it later if you got it

246
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,079
protected for a while so we looked at

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,200
several different ways of growing a

248
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,439
plants and manipulating the plants uh we

249
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,440
covered the plants with straw in the

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,000
early win late winter early spring to

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
see if we could delay their emergence

252
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,759
from the ground to see if that would

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,959
delay their flowering and Fring when

254
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,679
they canes came up out of the ground we

255
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,239
mowed them off and forced them to start

256
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:39,000
over again when the canes are about 2

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,919
and 1/2 ft tall we pinched the tips to

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,958
force them to grow branches and that

259
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,599
would slow them down we did the same

260
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,399
thing a little bit later and then we had

261
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,360
our controls that we didn't do anything

262
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,159
to and I'll just show you the tunnel

263
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,399
here uh before it was covered the plants

264
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,240
are grown in the ground about 7t spacing

265
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,440
between the rows uh we mulch them with

266
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
straw the first year we also

267
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,000
Incorporated compost into the area

268
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,839
before we planted and we just screw the

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,639
plants for uh a year the following year

270
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,240
for our mulching treatment we removed

271
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,519
the snow towards the end of

272
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,278
February on the plots and we replace

273
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,879
that snow with straw to insulate the

274
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,519
ground and hold in the cold and try to

275
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,120
hold the plants back and indeed when we

276
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,639
look later on in the season and when the

277
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,679
plants started to grow we can see that

278
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,519
the ones that were

279
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,319
mulched had were shorter and further

280
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,919
behind the ones that were not mulched

281
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,800
now remember this is intentional because

282
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,399
we want to deliberately delay the Fring

283
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,919
until later if we

284
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,399
can mowing made a big difference you the

285
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,159
plants that we mowed off and forced to

286
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,639
start over again were further behind

287
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,838
than those that were not mowed the

288
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,600
controls and that difference was

289
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,360
maintained uh throughout the

290
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,800
year we also pinched plants and we

291
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,320
pinched a growing tip when they were

292
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,199
about two and a half to 3 ft tall forced

293
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,160
them to grow these lateral branches that

294
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,160
slowed them down a little

295
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,399
bit

296
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,399
and you can see that difference is

297
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,399
maintained

298
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,680
throughout then we had all those

299
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,320
treatments and then uh towards the fall

300
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,359
of the year late summer early fall we

301
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,720
covered the

302
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,639
tunnel the plants

303
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,680
flowered and there we are covering the

304
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,759
tunnel on September 13th the one thing

305
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,078
is you don't have to have these tunnels

306
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,958
covered all the time in this case here

307
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,278
we only wanted to produce the crop late

308
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,359
so if we would have covered them early

309
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:50,759
it would have brought the crop on

310
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,079
earlier and we really didn't want that

311
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,639
we wanted to see how we could do by

312
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,000
having a late crop so we didn't want

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,839
them to accelerate their growth too much

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,958
so we waited until September to cover

315
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,160
over the

316
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:07,078
tunnel and there we are pulling the row

317
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,159
cover over the tunnel pulling it

318
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,559
down and there we are

319
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,198
harvesting uh question came up how's

320
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,799
hmbo top we've looked at HBO top at

321
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:18,039
Geneva in our variety trial and it does

322
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,078
pretty well in the tunnel too it's just

323
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,759
a little bit uh funky in terms of

324
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,599
picking it it's a little bit hard to um

325
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,078
see the fruit sometimes but in terms of

326
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,000
flavor and size it's a pretty good one

327
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,399
as well one of the dilemmas we have in

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,919
these tunnels is they're only so big and

329
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,879
you can't really look at a lot of

330
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,559
different things at one time but I'd

331
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,559
encourage you uh Brett to contact

332
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,198
Courtney Weber at

333
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,159
cw34 cornell.edu and he's got a lot of

334
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,039
data on hbot top along with a lot of

335
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,719
other varieties for the high tunnel

336
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,958
we've just looked at the ones that um

337
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,199
are a little bit more common that we

338
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,399
thought people could get a hold of and

339
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,758
use the one thing we were concerned

340
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,519
about in the high tunnel is pollination

341
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,360
late in the year you know in September

342
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,679
you're going to get bees and we were a

343
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,480
little bit concerned about that but we

344
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,198
found that the bees love the high tunnel

345
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,759
and they come in and droves and just

346
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,000
hang out in the tunnel here are our

347
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,680
bumblebees all over the place uh they

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,600
love that cool dry environment keeps

349
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,879
them out of the frost from outside and

350
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,680
we had no trouble with pollination of

351
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,600
our flowers in the house here we are mid

352
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,439
October lots and lots of raspberries

353
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,399
again outside we've had frost already

354
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,959
you see this outside but inside we have

355
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,360
lots of fruit now towards the end of

356
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,518
October early November we sometimes get

357
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,879
nights when it gets down in the mid to

358
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,839
low 20s but only just for maybe one

359
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,720
night and then it warms up again you got

360
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,199
another week or so really decent weather

361
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
what we do on those really cold nights

362
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,000
is we know that the plast that single

363
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,799
layer of plastic will not protect the

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,078
plants uh when it gets that cold but if

365
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,278
we take a row cover and throw over the

366
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:01,198
plants for just that night

367
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,519
and then take it off the next day often

368
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,359
that's enough to get the plants to that

369
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,480
one or two cold nights and then we're

370
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,278
done question is why are those bird

371
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
scare devices inside that tunnel well

372
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,278
remember we didn't cover that tunnel

373
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,638
until uh September 13th so during the

374
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,078
summer the birds would come in there and

375
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,039
Roost it wasn't so much a problem eating

376
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,719
the fruit as it was we just didn't like

377
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,319
the birds up there pooping on our heads

378
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,600
when we were trying to manipulate canes

379
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,319
and prune and stuff like

380
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,240
that

381
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:36,000
here we are November 5th in itha picking

382
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,839
pretty decent fruit and we got fruit all

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,879
the way up till November 15th and we've

384
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,759
done this for multiple years now and

385
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:44,198
November 15th is kind of about the end

386
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,318
of the line on the raspberries they'll

387
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:49,919
still be there but they don't ripen very

388
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,799
quickly so we cut it off then in terms

389
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,879
of how these treatments

390
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,719
worked this blue line here is a control

391
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,120
this is not doing any manipulation and

392
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,920
you can see that right here is when we

393
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,759
would get our first Frost so typically

394
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,879
we'd be done in the field right about

395
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,839
this point here but because we have the

396
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,039
tunnel the plants keep on producing

397
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,519
fruit all the way up till 14 weeks after

398
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,240
August 22nd that's a pretty long harvest

399
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,919
season 14

400
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,039
weeks by doing these pinching treatments

401
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,919
a little bit of late pinching or early

402
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,679
pinching we were able to delay the peak

403
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,159
of production until end of October and

404
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,519
so that was actually kind of a good way

405
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,719
of spreading out the Harvest Peak having

406
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,440
some that you don't pinch and having

407
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,240
some you pinch and it shifts a

408
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,600
production Peak about 4 Weeks

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,799
Later the other treatments we that I

410
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,639
explained to you the mulching treatment

411
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,519
and the mowing treatment they didn't do

412
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,000
as well uh so we're not exploring those

413
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,198
any further recommending those any

414
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,360
further but the pinching looks really

415
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,318
good pinching either you know right when

416
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,800
a p is about 2 and 1/2 to 3 and 1/2 ft

417
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,599
tall seems to be about the right time to

418
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:03,479
do that another Year's Day data same

419
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,360
thing you can see the control plots here

420
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,038
uh Frost comes here we normally be out

421
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,119
of the business just when we're getting

422
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,279
started but we can keep on going with

423
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,639
the controls and with the pinching this

424
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,918
early pinching when the plants are about

425
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,839
2 and a half to 3 feet tall uh shifted

426
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,439
the production Peak later and it really

427
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,000
didn't we didn't suffer that much in

428
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,079
terms of yield here's the yield uh from

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,279
the control and with the pinching

430
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,639
treatments and you can see some

431
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,440
reduction but uh not a lot with the

432
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,520
early pinching Berry size wasn't

433
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,798
affected the mulching and mowing

434
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,798
treatments I said didn't do very

435
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
well so the second strategy was uh take

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,400
these Prime canes and instead of getting

437
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,960
them to fruit late maybe we could cover

438
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,440
the tunnels early and bring them on

439
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,120
earlier and not only that but remember I

440
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,360
showed you the row covers over the

441
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,199
plants in the field when they were just

442
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,439
starting to emerge from the ground well

443
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,919
we thought well could we do the same

444
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,400
thing inside a high tunnel so not only

445
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,080
do the plants when they start up have a

446
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,840
a big high tunnel over them but they

447
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,678
also have a row cover or even a sheet of

448
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,959
plastic over them when they're short and

449
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,519
small and just coming up the ground we

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,759
could really maybe accelerate the

451
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,400
harvest season quite a bit by doing that

452
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,720
so we looked at that and this is the end

453
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,480
of the year um when they're starting to

454
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,038
harvest here are our plants in the field

455
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,599
that are growing outside the high tunnel

456
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,319
this is Heritage in the same Variety in

457
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,119
the high tunnel with some of these

458
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,879
treatments and my goodness these plants

459
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,839
grow like crazy in the high tunnel

460
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,120
really really tall and in fact the

461
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:40,199
Heritage plants grew so much that it was

462
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,158
a real problem harvesting them they were

463
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,440
just a little bit too tall for my short

464
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,520
helper here Jenny so he sometimes had to

465
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,360
stand on a little stool to get the fruit

466
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,558
off the top so did that mean that these

467
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,759
plants here had much higher yield than

468
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:58,359
these plants that were growing in a

469
00:18:53,759 --> 00:19:00,200
field well we looked at that and the

470
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,199
size of the plant the fruit didn't

471
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,279
really make much difference and the

472
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,558
yields actually didn't really make much

473
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,158
difference either the yields were pretty

474
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,839
good uh no matter if we covered them

475
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,039
early or not the difference was that the

476
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:16,199
ones that we covered early came on

477
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,000
sooner so the ones inside the tunnel uh

478
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,038
ripened earlier and maybe went a little

479
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,159
bit longer than those in the field where

480
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,519
the Harvest was delayed but for the most

481
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,240
part the yields didn't really change

482
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,240
that

483
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
much

484
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,440
the planning of plastic in September for

485
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,400
extended fall harvest the way I

486
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,840
explained earlier gave us 260 half pins

487
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
per tunnel applying plastic under the

488
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,639
tunnel in early spring for Accelerated

489
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,880
Harvest brought the crop on earlier but

490
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,880
the yield was just almost

491
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,519
identical the question is since you're

492
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,799
grown those really long canes what if

493
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,440
you saved those canes through the winter

494
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,918
and infed them the following spring

495
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,640
would it make a difference would it be

496
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,000
worthwhile doing how much yield do you

497
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,640
get from doing that so we uh did a study

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,359
where we double cropped versus single

499
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,880
cropped these plants both in the

500
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,959
field and in the

501
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,760
tunnel and here's our fall

502
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,079
crop

503
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:23,038
5600 gam per meter this is uh and then

504
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,319
when we held them over and harvested

505
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:29,359
again those now flu canes in the summer

506
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,480
we got about 50% more yield by doing

507
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,639
that again you have to overwinter the

508
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,200
canes but we did get an some additional

509
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,159
yield because of that same thing in the

510
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,960
field a far a fall crop and if you hold

511
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,600
it over and harvest those Flor canes the

512
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,440
following summer you get about 50% more

513
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:52,359
yield maybe not quite that much so um it

514
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,400
might be worth it it might not be I know

515
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:56,399
our summer helpers didn't particularly

516
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,280
like picking those flues in the

517
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,080
summertime the crop is a little a little

518
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,558
bit shorter and lower a little bit

519
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,678
harder to pick but you definitely got

520
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,279
additional fruit from that the big

521
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,038
difference between the field in the

522
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,480
tunnel in this case was that the yields

523
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,879
were somewhat Less in the field than the

524
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,400
indoor tunnel and the marketable yeld is

525
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
better inside the tunnel than

526
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,759
outside a third strategy was trying to

527
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,720
overwinter Tender blackberries and

528
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,038
raspberries in a high tunnel so you know

529
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,000
in year like this we're probably going

530
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,599
to get some Blackberry winterkill for

531
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,679
sure and maybe some raspberry winterkill

532
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,599
and can a high tunnel protect your

533
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,400
plants from that well you know this

534
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,158
tunnel is only just a single sheet of

535
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,240
plastic it's not very

536
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,278
substantial and you know the tunnels

537
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,839
we're using for overwintering are these

538
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,640
peaked tunnels they're not the like the

539
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,918
hay Grove type which is rounded at the

540
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,360
top th that plastic really has to come

541
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,559
off in the fall before the snow hits

542
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,158
these tunnels here are espcially

543
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,879
constructed with a little bit of

544
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,760
reinforced steel the uh pipes are about

545
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,200
4T apart instead of

546
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,278
five but and so it'll hold a snow load

547
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,880
it'll Shed off of these points but um it

548
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,159
is still only a single sheet of plastic

549
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,278
and these tunnels don't have

550
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,919
supplemental heat so if a plant can

551
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,960
survive in there the temperature is

552
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:25,120
still getting pretty darn

553
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,798
cold but what we found is that not only

554
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,479
do the plants survive in those tunnels

555
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,240
even with a single sheet of plastic but

556
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,839
they really Thrive these are some

557
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,679
thornless blackberries in June it's only

558
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,240
June and the canes are already really

559
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,640
really tall and if you don't do anything

560
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,038
with these canes by the time the end of

561
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,880
the summer comes they can be 15 20 feet

562
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:50,319
tall it's amazing how well they grow and

563
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,720
here we are looking at this down the

564
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,720
alleyway between the rows and you can

565
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,480
just see these thornless blackberries

566
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,720
just uh really make a jungle there in

567
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,558
fact one of the the challenges is

568
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
managing the vegetation on these R uh

569
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,599
blackberries inside the tunnel and

570
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
outside and you can see just a

571
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,519
comparison between

572
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,440
outside thornless blackberries and

573
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,440
inside they grow really really well in

574
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,840
that tunnel environment and they over

575
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,000
winter well too and here's a picture

576
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,158
this appeared in our College newsletter

577
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,079
they uh did a little feature article on

578
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,640
high tunnels and you can just see in the

579
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,678
background the amount of blackberries

580
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,038
that are produced in these high tunnels

581
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,278
it's really

582
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,640
remarkable but compared outside there's

583
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,960
not a lot going on in fact we hardly

584
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,000
ever Harvest much of a crop outside but

585
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,600
inside the tunnel they do real well uh

586
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,720
we had a high tunnel at willsboro this

587
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,599
year which is up along Lake Champlain

588
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,839
just south of the Canadian border right

589
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,918
along the Vermont border we grew some

590
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,439
raspberries both inside and outside the

591
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,200
tunnel there harvested them this year

592
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,840
and you can just see the difference

593
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,640
between outside yields in inside yields

594
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:04,678
there are more than twice as much inside

595
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,919
as outside uh especially for Jewel black

596
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,679
raspberry oncore uh the high tunnel just

597
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,320
made a huge difference in that very cold

598
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,640
climate up along Lake

599
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,038
Champlain this is the back down IFA a

600
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
little bit more mild of black

601
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,919
raspberries we don't get a huge increase

602
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,879
in yield when we look at the difference

603
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,679
between outside and inside here about

604
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,840
you know 28 30% greater yield

605
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,159
um size is usually bigger marketable

606
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,038
yields bigger uh Harvest season's longer

607
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,200
but uh the blackberries are what really

608
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:43,359
respond to the high tunnel between

609
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,159
inside and outside here's some data on

610
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,079
for three varieties Doyle a witch and

611
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,799
triple crown and and every any variable

612
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,798
we looked at whether it be season length

613
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,639
or size of fruit or eel per plant or

614
00:24:53,798 --> 00:25:00,038
percent marketable fruit inside the

615
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,640
tunnel was greater than outside every

616
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,839
variable every case every variety and I

617
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,759
mean the yield differences were huge

618
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:09,359
basically fruit in these plants outside

619
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,960
you just doesn't do it I mean you might

620
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,038
get a little bit of fruit but boy when

621
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,399
you put them inside a tunnel they just

622
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,679
yield like crazy yields are just so much

623
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,278
greater inside than outside the tunnel

624
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,798
and here's just some yield distribution

625
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,679
curves of uh

626
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:28,319
doy that's inside the tunnel and outside

627
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,519
the tunnel and you there's no comparison

628
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,000
you don't have to be a statistician to

629
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,119
figure out that there's significant

630
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,480
yield differences between these plants

631
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,439
and these are different years different

632
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,759
varieties and we get the same thing

633
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,360
every time we do it again same data

634
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,839
inside outside the yields are just

635
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:50,079
remarkably different inside than outside

636
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,038
so I think I've made a case of

637
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,759
blackberries thornless Blackberry can do

638
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:57,720
really well inside the tunnel the one

639
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:01,000
problem we've had with those however are

640
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,640
uh rodent damage this year when we went

641
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,679
out in March and April to look at our

642
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,360
plants after a long winter almost all

643
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,320
the in fact all the canes were girdled

644
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,359
just like this from about a foot up

645
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,439
maybe a foot and a half up from the

646
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,719
ground from Rabbits they got into the

647
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
tunnel over the winter these nice

648
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,880
Blackberry canes don't have thorns on

649
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,399
them and they fed themselves in the bark

650
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,520
all winter long and we didn't have any

651
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,239
yield from our blackberries this year

652
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,079
because of the rabbit damage so that's

653
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
something to watch out for this year the

654
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,519
high tunnels have chicken wire around

655
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
them to keep the rabbits out so we'll

656
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:39,558
see how that

657
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,880
works then our fourth strategy is to

658
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,158
grow primee fru and blackberries under

659
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,640
tunnels now these are relatively new

660
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,840
they were just developed in Arkansas

661
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,480
about 5 years ago these grow like the

662
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,519
Heritage red raspberry except they're

663
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,720
blackberries and the Blackberry canes

664
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,839
grow up and they flower in the late

665
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,919
summer and they fruit in the fall and

666
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,240
give you an opportunity to have fruit in

667
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,960
October now when we grow these plants

668
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,278
outside in IFA we tend not to get a crop

669
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,480
because it's just too late we get a

670
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,880
little bit the r the blackberries are

671
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,319
just starting to ripen but then the cold

672
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,520
weather comes and we're done but if we

673
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,480
could grow these under a high tunnel uh

674
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,119
the plants can keep on growing these

675
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,159
blackberries were developed in Arkansas

676
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,678
so we have to convince the blackberries

677
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,760
that they're still growing in Arkansas

678
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,919
even though it's upstate New York and by

679
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,879
putting them in a tunnel we uh can

680
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,559
convince them to do that so these are

681
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,320
what the blackberries look like in the

682
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:39,319
fall they look like regular

683
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,159
blackberries and here's our Blackberry

684
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,278
plots and we did some experiments on

685
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:48,278
them just like we did with the

686
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,398
raspberries we did some pinching of

687
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:56,240
pranes we did some bending of prices we

688
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:58,158
had control plots and U we covered the

689
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
tunnel late in the summer

690
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,919
we let them flour we let them fruit we

691
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,519
harvested the plots and this is what the

692
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,720
the crop looks like you can see the yel

693
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,000
potential here is pretty good uh the

694
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,640
berry size is really large really big

695
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,398
fruit and the flavor is pretty good uh

696
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,278
these are the treatments We examined to

697
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:20,079
control the two different pinching times

698
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,278
and bending the canes uh when they reach

699
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,038
the first wire to see if that somehow

700
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:26,319
would promote more fruiting and earlier

701
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:29,278
fruiting here's our pinching treatment

702
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,639
same as with the red

703
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:35,440
raspberries we did some bending

704
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,399
treatments and I don't I don't have the

705
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,278
yield data all done yet but the pinching

706
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:41,639
treatments work the same way they do

707
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,119
with the red raspberries they actually

708
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,038
in this case seem to increase the yield

709
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,558
a little bit and they uh bring the crop

710
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,440
on a little bit later give you a longer

711
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:54,599
extended season the bending treatments

712
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,519
didn't work uh very well at all uh so we

713
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,639
won't go back and do that or recommend

714
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:02,679
that but pinching seems to be a good

715
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,720
thing for these primee fru in

716
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,759
blackberries now the one thing that the

717
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,120
blackberries did this year that the

718
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,599
raspberries did not do is that when the

719
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,038
weather turned cold in October we had an

720
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:18,398
exceptionally cold and wet October this

721
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:21,398
year the can the laterals with the fruit

722
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:25,079
uh well they turn brown They sort of

723
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:27,599
wilted um we think this is uh stress

724
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:30,480
injury from the cold temperatures none

725
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,759
of the fruiting none of the laterals

726
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,480
that did not have fruits like the

727
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,359
vegetative laterals exhibited this

728
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,000
symptom it was only laterals with fruit

729
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,678
on it and we think what's going on here

730
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,440
because the October was so dark and cool

731
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,600
that there wasn't enough carbohydrate in

732
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,399
these plants particularly with fruit so

733
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,079
the fruit drew the carbohydrate out of

734
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:50,599
the plant and the leaves just didn't

735
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,879
have enough carbohydrate didn't have

736
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,879
enough ability to make antifreeze or

737
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,080
whatever they produce to give them

738
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,240
resistance to cold and they just sort of

739
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,599
collapsed so our yields weren't as high

740
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,359
as we had hoped we left a lot of reddish

741
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,798
fruit here in the plants that

742
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,000
theoretically could have been harvested

743
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:11,599
in a more normal year that had a little

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,599
bit more light and heat in

745
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,519
October so one of our biggest challenges

746
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,038
to producing these plants in the

747
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:22,240
greenhouse or the high tunnel are the

748
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:25,919
high yields we get and the chalices that

749
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,880
we've used were a bit of a problematic

750
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,480
you know typically in a field you just

751
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,120
get a fence post and you pound it in the

752
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,798
ground and you Bol a 2x4 to it and put a

753
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,798
couple wires in and you're off and

754
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:41,278
running but the problem inside a high

755
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,798
tunnel is you know it's when your canes

756
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,480
are spread out in a V like that it's a

757
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,359
little bit hard to get down the alleyway

758
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,759
you have no flexibility on adjusting

759
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:52,879
these and they're just clunky and they

760
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:56,960
not really that strong actually so we've

761
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,880
been working with a a fella from Indiana

762
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,600
who who has this company called trellis

763
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,320
growing systems is working on this new

764
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,000
kind of trellis that has the capacity to

765
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,038
support the heavy volume of weight that

766
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,359
you get from the prime canes and the

767
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,119
fruit that's produced on those and this

768
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:16,359
is what this looks like it's a made out

769
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,558
of reinforced fiberglass supposed to be

770
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:20,678
stronger than steel but it has a little

771
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:22,558
bit of flexibility you uh pound a post

772
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,639
into the ground about a foot and a

773
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,440
little plate here that holds it a square

774
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,798
you bolt this aluminum piece onto it

775
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
that has pins in it and I'll show you

776
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:33,759
those pins in a minute and you can

777
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,519
adjust the angle of

778
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,919
these trellis arms and then there's

779
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:43,480
wires here to support the canes they can

780
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,278
be adjusted and slit up and down this uh

781
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,679
TR arm here to any height you want so

782
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,960
that works pretty slick so here's black

783
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,679
raspberries in an open position with

784
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,519
this system and then you can just pull

785
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,759
out the pins and close them up and gives

786
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,960
you more space for walking down the

787
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,119
Alleyway so

788
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,759
open and uh the way you adjust it is you

789
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,959
just pull out the pins move the bar and

790
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,240
then put the pins back in to whatever

791
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,480
angle you want and it's pretty slick

792
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,440
doesn't take up a lot of space he's

793
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,000
developed a way to Anchor them into the

794
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,480
ground it doesn't use a lot of space

795
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,200
around here and that space inside a high

796
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,360
tunnel is pretty valuable and these

797
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,038
wires get pounded into the ground and

798
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,519
there's a little device there that

799
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:28,720
catches about a foot down and uh

800
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,000
provides support for these posts so they

801
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,000
don't

802
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,960
collapse the rows that we uh produce

803
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,519
here we have our tunnels are the

804
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:46,759
standard size is 30 ft wide and 20 I'm

805
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,599
sorry and 96 ft long we find that four

806
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:53,558
rows down the high tunnel is best so

807
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:56,278
each of those rows are about seven feet

808
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,440
apart 7 and a half feet apart and that

809
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:02,200
gives you enough space to to work in

810
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,720
between them the tunnels also are the

811
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,360
sides of the tunnels have a 4ft

812
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,079
extension before the bend starts a lot

813
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,959
of tunnels maybe for greens and all

814
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,879
start to bend right away but we have our

815
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,399
sides elevated for feet so we can get

816
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,880
the two end rows of raspberries

817
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,359
relatively close to the walls of the

818
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,639
tunnel uh and you have that height there

819
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,599
this is the website of the company that

820
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,678
we're working with that has this

821
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,480
flexible trell system and the next

822
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,159
presentation fumi is going to be talking

823
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,240
about how to uh use this type of system

824
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,519
Outdoors to bring protection to your

825
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,720
plants if you don't have a high tunnel

826
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,399
and you want to still cover them uh you

827
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,440
can grow them in such a way that they

828
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,678
can bend down and be covered with a high

829
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,399
tunnel provided you have a decent trell

830
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,440
system to do that a high tunnel I'll go

831
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,638
through some numbers here in a second

832
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,558
how much do high tunnels cost our

833
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,678
pre-plant preparation our Tunnel

834
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:59,079
construction plant establishment

835
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,200
irrigation TRS we spent this

836
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,359
$1,096 I mean we kept really good track

837
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,319
this is how much it costs for everything

838
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,158
to build that tunnel pay in somebody and

839
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:11,838
everything and say wow you know that's a

840
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:14,760
lot of money $111,000 for a 30X 96t

841
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,358
tunnel um and then the Harvest the

842
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,119
plants and to produce the crop and all

843
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:19,759
that we have production costs and

844
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,440
harvesting costs which you're going to

845
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,879
have anyway 4,000 half pints uh per

846
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,000
tunnel 250 a half pint you get about

847
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:33,039
$10,000 of yield per tunnel but when you

848
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,918
run those numbers out for several years

849
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,119
so the first year you don't have any

850
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:39,838
money coming in and you spent you know

851
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,079
nearly $112,000 without anything coming

852
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,320
in doesn't sound so good the next year

853
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,440
first year you have fruit you have to

854
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,919
spend some money getting that fruit

855
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,398
harvested you're going to get $10,000 in

856
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:54,398
sales uh that offsets that initial cost

857
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,319
second year same thing you about broke

858
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,400
even but the nice thing is from about

859
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,960
year three on on you you have very

860
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,440
little cost going into that tunnel

861
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,320
except for harvesting costs and a little

862
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,960
bit of production costs and then you

863
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,160
start running into the black at a pretty

864
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,960
high level we've had these tunnels

865
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:12,838
looked at by several economists and they

866
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,159
all say he it's about the best thing

867
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,838
we've seen in agriculture in terms of an

868
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,838
investment uh you get payback within 3

869
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:23,199
years and after that the return is

870
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:26,000
pretty good every 3 or 4 years you have

871
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:29,439
to replace the plastic and that cost you

872
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,039
maybe 3 or 400 $ but it's not $3 or

873
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,358
$4,000 it's just a few

874
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:39,079
hundred we found that that uh help that

875
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:41,239
$300 or $400 cost every 3 or four years

876
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,839
happens whether you put the tunnel on or

877
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:46,639
the cover on just for the fall or you

878
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,039
leave it on year round it's about the

879
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,480
same inter uh could you intercrop in

880
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,599
year one and two I suppose you could if

881
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,960
you could um put some maybe um greens or

882
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,079
something like that in there and you

883
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,559
didn't have too many weeds growing

884
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,000
between your Alleyways I suppose you

885
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:06,559
could that's something we haven't

886
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,400
done uh when we look at the equivalent

887
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:13,119
yields um we can get about 20,000 pounds

888
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,960
of fruit per acre in a tunnel on a per

889
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,960
acre basis compared to about 2,000 in

890
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,199
the field so the yield differen is

891
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,000
dramatic and why is that well our rows

892
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,318
are about twice as close together in the

893
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,960
tunnel because we're not driving a

894
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,559
tractor down the alleyway our harvest

895
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,599
season is about two two and a half times

896
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,639
long longer and for some reason

897
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,960
physiologically you saw those pictures

898
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,960
the plants just grow better in the

899
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,960
tunnel and the yield per plant just

900
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,440
seems to be so much higher so if you

901
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,920
multiply two by time 2.5 * 2 you get

902
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
close to 10 times higher it's remarkable

903
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,800
then the yields are higher I'm sorry the

904
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,199
price you get for fruit off season is

905
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,640
higher than it is in season we have a

906
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:54,358
store that we sell and uh is pretty

907
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:57,719
remarkable and the gross revenues

908
00:36:54,358 --> 00:37:00,279
150,000 per acre pretty remarkable

909
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,959
uh this can be done with Greenhouse

910
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,240
production and pots the same way uh we

911
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,679
don't have time to get into a lot of

912
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,879
detail on that but the same principles

913
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:11,318
hold grow the plants and pots instead of

914
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,400
um in the ground and we have a

915
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:16,039
production bulletin on our website that

916
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,318
you can read all about doing this too

917
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,759
and that's what that looks like and uh

918
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,400
just to end up I just want to show you

919
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,119
some pictures of some Growers that are

920
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,119
doing this all over the country this is

921
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,200
Michigan uh Washington doing the same

922
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,358
thing some are doing pot some are doing

923
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,480
ground but the principles are sort of

924
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:36,480
the

925
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,560
same uh Simco

926
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:49,400
Ontario New Jersey so anyway we're real

927
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,760
excited about the fact that we can

928
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,079
manipulate these raspberries and

929
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,040
blackberries in different ways to

930
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,760
provide fruit over a very long period of

931
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:59,639
time it seems like we have an opport o

932
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,880
Unity now in the Northern Tier states to

933
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,480
really make a dramatic impact on the

934
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,599
time of year that our berries are

935
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,480
available and get a higher price and

936
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,960
increase our yields and increase the

937
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,119
quality of fruit all at the same

938
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,960
time all right so Laura that's about you

939
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,680
Mar um there was a question about how

940
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,838
often you should replant the high

941
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:27,679
tunnels tunnels so we have not replanted

942
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:30,799
our high tunnels yet uh We've we had

943
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:33,199
five years of raspberries growing in the

944
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,720
tunnels and we haven't seen any decline

945
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:40,279
in yield or growth or any increase in

946
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:42,000
diseases over that 5year period so

947
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,640
that's pretty good I can tell you

948
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,358
outside that after 5 years you sometimes

949
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,078
start to see uh the impacts of the

950
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,000
weather and diseases and weeds and

951
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,240
things like that but we don't have to

952
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,559
deal with that in a tunnel so I think

953
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:58,318
the you know 10 or 15 years I think is

954
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,400
not at all unreasonable for uh keeping

955
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:02,039
these plants and a tunnel of course no

956
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,880
one's had tunnels that long so we don't

957
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,199
know but I think that's a reasonable

958
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,838
guess and there was a question earlier

959
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,239
and I may have been typing because it

960
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,679
was when we lost the video about the

961
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,239
wind speed of tunnels did you address

962
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:19,919
that Marvin the the wind it was about

963
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:23,719
the wind speed um that that caused that

964
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,720
first tunnel that you showed to fall

965
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,720
down oh yeah okay so that was a tunnel

966
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,920
up at Geneva and that was installed in

967
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,879
September one of the Hurricanes came up

968
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:40,000
through um and the wind speed was around

969
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,440
60 M hour it was a hay grve tunnel and

970
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,199
the hay Groves are three season tunnels

971
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,159
are not Four Season tunnels are not made

972
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,000
to withstand a snow load nor are they

973
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,679
made to withstand heavy winds the

974
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,039
unfortunate thing here was that the

975
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,199
plastic was on that tunnel and the wind

976
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,838
came on a Sunday when no one was around

977
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:59,358
to take it off so uh ideally that that

978
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,199
plastic would have been folded down and

979
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,719
put in the v's of the tunnel before that

980
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,279
wind came through and just because it

981
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,480
was at the University and it was on a

982
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,000
weekend and we didn't really predict

983
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,880
that high wind they kind of got caught

984
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,280
and a tunnel got destroyed but typically

985
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,800
you can deal with that just by taking

986
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,640
the plastic off before that wind comes

987
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,119
through great and um you know if you

988
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,960
folks can wait the we have a couple more

989
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,400
questions and we will definitely get to

990
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,400
them but I want to make sure that we I

991
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,800
forgot to introduce a couple of polls

992
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
and we're going to do them and then

993
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,480
we'll have um Dr teita give his

994
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
presentation and I I promise that we

995
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,318
will make sure that everyone's questions

996
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,240
are answered um let me introduce a

997
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:46,119
couple of these uh poll questions to

998
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,759
help us get a better idea of um The

999
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,519
Experience level of the group and uh

1000
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,040
you'll see how to answer them in just a

1001
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,358
second

1002
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,960
um let me make sure they go in and you

1003
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:01,759
you can just vote and um then when we

1004
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,838
get most everybody voting we'll move to

1005
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,400
the second one so thank you very much it

1006
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,400
just says are you currently growing

1007
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,680
raspberries in high tunnels yes I have

1008
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,119
more than one season of experience yes I

1009
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:17,118
have planted raspberries in a high

1010
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,960
tunnel but of just one season uh no I

1011
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
have not yet planted raspberries in a

1012
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,960
high tunnel but I'm seriously

1013
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,399
considering it or no I or I have no

1014
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,720
plans on using a high tunnel for

1015
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,079
raspberries or blackberries and if

1016
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:33,078
people could just give us that uh

1017
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,480
feedback that would be really helpful so

1018
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,480
we have about uh half of the group

1019
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,400
voting and while you're all doing this

1020
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:51,400
I'll um load up the

1021
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,400
next

1022
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,239
presentation

1023
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,119
all right we have anybody else want to

1024
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:09,039
vote there we've got about 30 people out

1025
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:12,760
of 52 folks that have

1026
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,759
voted give you another

1027
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,640
second oops um somebody has closed the

1028
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,920
poll I'm sorry about that we'll just uh

1029
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,920
hide that and then I'll open up the next

1030
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,159
one

1031
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,358
this one asks if you are currently

1032
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,800
growing blackberries and you can answer

1033
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:37,960
that yes you are a

1034
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,760
beginner or yes you have been growing

1035
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,119
them for many years and need information

1036
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,720
on trellising and high tunnel

1037
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:46,559
possibilities uh or no you do not plan

1038
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,039
to add blackberries to your crop mix

1039
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,640
because of temperature

1040
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,000
limitations or no you do not plan on

1041
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,598
adding blackberries due to an unknown

1042
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,519
Market or you are not currently growing

1043
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,079
blackberries but do plan on adding them

1044
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:03,599
to your crop mix and if you would just

1045
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,599
give us some feedback that would be

1046
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:12,679
great and we've got about 27 if we can

1047
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,000
get up to about that 30 level or so that

1048
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,000
would be

1049
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,919
terrific all right I'm just going to

1050
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,838
close that poll now thank you I have one

1051
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,920
more to one more poll um and I

1052
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:39,440
appreciate Dr te's patience here

1053
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,680
and this just talks about

1054
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,679
um

1055
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:47,519
using adoption of um High tunnels what

1056
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,358
has what have been or still are the

1057
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,400
biggest obstacles for your adoption of a

1058
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,838
high tunnel for a bramble crop um the

1059
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,800
initial cost of the tunnel the cost of

1060
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,639
the labor involved in harvesting the

1061
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,920
crop you not do not know enough about

1062
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,679
managing the crop in a high tunnel or

1063
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
you are not sure that your Market will

1064
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,960
support the extended season and or the

1065
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,358
increased production that you might get

1066
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,480
in high tunnel and you can vote more

1067
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:13,480
than once on

1068
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:27,960
these okay we have a couple people that

1069
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:29,639
didn't have the full view I'm sorry

1070
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,920
about

1071
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:35,400
that give you that and if you're an

1072
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,280
extension educator um you really don't

1073
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,920
need to reply I know that there are a

1074
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,519
number of you but if you do have any

1075
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,599
aspirations to grow Bramble crops um

1076
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:50,358
we'd love to get some feedback from

1077
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,800
you and I think that's

1078
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:57,400
about about it so I'm going to shut that

1079
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,400
pod and now I would really like to it's

1080
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,720
my pleasure to introduce to you our

1081
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,680
second speaker and that is Dr fomi teita

1082
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:08,000
and I hope I'm pronouncing that

1083
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,118
correctly I'm sorry um he works for the

1084
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,639
United States Department of Agriculture

1085
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:16,920
the EG research station and in Caryville

1086
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:18,519
West Virginia um he has been involved in

1087
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,760
developing year round culture for

1088
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,800
strawberries um utilizing controlled

1089
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,079
environment protective covers and

1090
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,880
soiless substrates he also has worked on

1091
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,318
optimizing production of plantlets in

1092
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,800
soiless uh substrates for out of season

1093
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,318
fruit production and he studied the

1094
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,318
resource uh storage and allocation of

1095
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,480
environmental factors that affect

1096
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:44,558
reproductive organ development in

1097
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,280
strawberry and blackberry but today he's

1098
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,720
going to be talking to us about um

1099
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,200
another trellis system for blackberries

1100
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,959
and Dr teita I will turn off my

1101
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,879
microphone and let you take over from

1102
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,880
here

1103
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,159
thank you Laura good afternoon

1104
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,078
everyone uh I'd like to talk to you

1105
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:09,118
about a unique trellising system we have

1106
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,079
developed here to train blackberries to

1107
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,640
facilitate harvesting and to

1108
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:19,720
improve uh over reduce winter injury in

1109
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:22,000
both erect and uh trailing

1110
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:24,598
blackberries uh if you have grown

1111
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,119
blackberries in the East especially in

1112
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,119
the Northeast you probably have seen

1113
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:34,599
plants

1114
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:38,680
look like they shown in the play

1115
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:41,000
a uh where Flor canes in the springtime

1116
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:45,719
develop no flowering shoes so they're

1117
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,719
bare in Kill back to the ground uh we

1118
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:53,078
can provide winter protection using the

1119
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:55,239
things I'll be describing this afternoon

1120
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:57,599
as well as use high tunnels and

1121
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:59,799
Greenhouse to grow black berries here in

1122
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,800
the

1123
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:08,199
Northeast to uh reduce winter injury and

1124
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:11,640
realze a reasonable amount of fruit in

1125
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:11,639
the summer the following

1126
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,960
summer uh let's look at some of the data

1127
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:26,640
published by uh

1128
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,039
researchers uh such as the but hardtin

1129
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:33,598
of various

1130
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:36,800
blackberries uh the thornless and semi

1131
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,760
blackberries uh when they're exposed to

1132
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,280
freezing temperatures under control

1133
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,119
laboratory

1134
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,760
conditions uh when the buds are exposed

1135
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:54,160
to temperatures around minus 10 Fen uh

1136
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:57,720
Fahrenheit but half the buds will be

1137
00:47:54,159 --> 00:48:00,078
killed uh and contrast the trailing

1138
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,919
blackberries that have been developed in

1139
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,079
the Pacific

1140
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:09,720
Northwest uh show 50% but kill when

1141
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,800
temperatures are drop only down to+ 12

1142
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,399
Fahrenheit so that the trailing

1143
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:18,839
blackberries are very susceptible to low

1144
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,838
temperature uh

1145
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:29,119
temperatures and Marvin uh mentioned

1146
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,640
earlier here about how to reduce winter

1147
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,519
injury and he talked about using

1148
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:38,920
structur such as green houses and high

1149
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:43,280
tunnels to reduce winter injury uh other

1150
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,880
options are one that one consider would

1151
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:51,599
be uh growing cold tolerant

1152
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,318
varieties uh there are some that seem to

1153
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:58,960
be uh a little harder than others such

1154
00:48:54,318 --> 00:49:01,599
as uh El Hardy from the University of

1155
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,960
Illinois and

1156
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,160
uh I think the uh Chester thess may do

1157
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,039
well in the uh southern

1158
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:15,920
Pennsylvania uh you could also take

1159
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:18,599
action to reduce uh winter injury by

1160
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,039
insulating the plants such as using

1161
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:25,599
structures and other uh mulchi material

1162
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:28,358
such as straw plastic foam or just

1163
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,680
covering plants with rad cover or ice

1164
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:32,880
and snow in uh certain areas around the

1165
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,358
Great Lakes

1166
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:40,400
area and all these

1167
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,798
insulation uh would uh insulate plants

1168
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,880
from the cold temperatures as well as

1169
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:46,880
protect plants from cold dry Winter

1170
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,280
Winds uh i' like to now talk to you

1171
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,639
about uh what we have done here at the

1172
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,160
current ber for West Virginia in the

1173
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:01,159
last uh 10 15

1174
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:08,039
years uh the Eastern varieties such as

1175
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,720
triple crown and

1176
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:16,318
Apache uh do well in uh zone six and uh

1177
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:20,118
they produce 25 to 30 pounds of fruit

1178
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:23,440
per plant in the open system so they do

1179
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:27,200
not require any winter protection to do

1180
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:31,280
well in the Middle Atlantic Coast

1181
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,239
region uh however the trailing varieties

1182
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,920
from Oregon suffer severe winter injury

1183
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,118
in in our

1184
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,280
area uh they're typically killed to the

1185
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,240
ground every winter I've been told by

1186
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Jim ballington at NC State even in North

1187
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:52,919
Carolina uh trailing varieties such as

1188
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,440
cscu uh rarely produce fruit because of

1189
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,440
a winter

1190
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,440
injury

1191
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:06,119
uh cescu as I mentioned uh was developed

1192
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:10,358
by the USDA in Oregon and does Well in

1193
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:14,720
Oregon as well as in various parts in

1194
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:17,558
California and It suffers a severe

1195
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:20,838
injury when temperature drops down to

1196
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:20,839
about 15°

1197
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:30,118
fahit so uh what I'll be talking now is

1198
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,559
about this simple winter protection

1199
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:38,039
system we have developed here and it it

1200
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:41,079
emboss the two two ideas that Marvin may

1201
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:45,159
have t have talked earlier is the the

1202
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:48,760
use of this rotating crossarm or RCA

1203
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:51,960
trellis and the application of floating

1204
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,119
Roll Cover over the plants in during the

1205
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:59,559
winter

1206
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:07,920
months the uh rotating cross arm TRS the

1207
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:07,920
RCA has a a short post and a long cross

1208
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,519
arm that could be rotated about the uh

1209
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:23,519
uh the uh Post in the

1210
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:23,519
ground

1211
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,280
okay

1212
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:48,640
like okay uh the here's the post uh in

1213
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:53,000
this case it's about 30 in high with the

1214
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:55,960
cross arm that is about 5T in length and

1215
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,519
there are like four or five wires

1216
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,880
on this long cross arm and also has a

1217
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:06,838
stationary short arm with a wire to

1218
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:10,960
catch the Lal canes but the but this

1219
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:13,440
main crossarm could be rotated to put uh

1220
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,000
to manipulate the canopy of the

1221
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,000
blackberry

1222
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:21,679
plant the

1223
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,359
uh system we had

1224
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:28,239
developed here uh has been commercial

1225
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:33,759
ized by a trellis growing system in Fort

1226
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:37,078
wi Indiana and they have the uh uh uh

1227
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,079
improved version for

1228
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:55,480
sale uh the Tris TGs system has uh

1229
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:58,000
components made of fiber fiberglass and

1230
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:03,798
some uh

1231
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,599
uh mle parts and it's has these two arms

1232
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:10,000
one long one that could be rotated and a

1233
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:13,599
short arm to catch the lateral canes and

1234
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
has a much better uh anchoring system to

1235
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:21,000
keep the post crossarm stabilized uh

1236
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,760
during the growing season than the

1237
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,880
system we had developed here uh 15 years

1238
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:32,119
ago

1239
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:36,079
what this RCA system does is is that it

1240
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:39,039
is that it allows the blackberry plant

1241
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:43,798
canopy to be man manipulated during the

1242
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:47,400
growing season and to position the fruit

1243
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:53,280
on one side of the uh

1244
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:57,960
row shown here uh that the system allows

1245
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,599
about 95% of the fruit to be uh

1246
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,798
positioned on one side of the roow

1247
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:07,798
making harvesting more

1248
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:12,199
efficient what the system allows is that

1249
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:16,400
the the uh for Primal canes to grow on

1250
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:19,439
this training wire and eventually allow

1251
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,559
the lateral canes to develop on these

1252
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,599
Primal canes uh develop many more

1253
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:31,280
lateral canes that are

1254
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:34,160
5 ft or long or more so so that the uh

1255
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,200
fooding capacity of that plant is

1256
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:40,038
increased uh tremendously because of the

1257
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:44,838
increased number of axillary buds or

1258
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:49,280
flower buds on the uh long lateral canes

1259
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:51,239
and because the uh the crossarm arm

1260
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,720
could be rotated during the growing

1261
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:56,879
season it's possible to uh

1262
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,399
to

1263
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,160
rotate the lateral canes that are

1264
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,880
trained on this long arm to be brought

1265
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:10,199
down close to the ground in a winter

1266
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,318
months and then that allows the uh allow

1267
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:15,480
us to place the Roll Cover on this

1268
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:18,880
lowprofile

1269
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,880
plant uh

1270
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,640
structure how how is this training done

1271
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,640
on the RCA trus

1272
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:31,318
of course the blackberry plants have

1273
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:35,000
Primal canes and floral canes and during

1274
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:38,639
the first growing season for the plant

1275
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,880
the Primal canes emerge from the uh

1276
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,879
crown and

1277
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,880
they

1278
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:53,880
grow upright in the in the case of the

1279
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:55,879
uh uh erect and semi erect

1280
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,079
cultivars

1281
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:03,559
showing

1282
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:06,720
here and on the r RC trus what we do is

1283
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:10,079
the uh is this once the uh these Primal

1284
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,239
canes reach beyond the height of the

1285
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,280
training

1286
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:19,558
wire uh which is about 20 to 24 in off

1287
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:23,359
the ground we force them to grow

1288
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:26,039
horizontally as shown here they're bent

1289
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,960
and tied to this training wire so that

1290
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,240
the Primal anes grow sideways or

1291
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,039
horizontally as you could see the tips

1292
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:37,399
of these Primal canes are here instead

1293
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:42,039
of uh growing straight

1294
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:44,400
upright okay Dr teita there's a question

1295
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:49,280
there's a question about the recommended

1296
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,280
numbers of buds in each lateral in this

1297
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:57,440
system okay yeah I got the question uh

1298
00:57:53,719 --> 00:58:01,838
let's see let me go back one slide and

1299
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,838
show you this okay

1300
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,358
I I'm not good at using the pointer here

1301
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:13,598
yeah click it on and then hold it when

1302
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:17,239
the button turns dark yeah there you go

1303
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:19,519
okay okay here are the Primal canes uh

1304
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:21,439
theless black bears tend to produce six

1305
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,199
or seven Primal canes during the growing

1306
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:29,318
season but we limit the number of prime

1307
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:32,318
that we train on the system to

1308
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:36,400
three all three Primal canes are tied to

1309
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:38,519
this training wire these are the Primal

1310
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:43,240
canes now question was about lateral

1311
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,239
canes I'll go to that in a

1312
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:53,399
moment okay here we have maybe four

1313
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:56,558
Primal canes t uh trained up and tied to

1314
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:01,000
this training wire

1315
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:03,720
okay and as these Prim bent Primal canes

1316
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,559
reach the adjacent plant which is

1317
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:12,679
usually 5 to six feet away those tips

1318
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:16,319
are uh cut off or tipped which uh

1319
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:20,719
promotes the axillary buds along the uh

1320
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:25,599
horizontal portion of these three Primal

1321
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:31,439
canes to develop and then lateral canes

1322
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:35,559
emerge okay uh in this system we try to

1323
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:39,000
let all the uh lateral canes

1324
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:40,240
develop along the horizontal potion

1325
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,880
since we're

1326
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:47,399
leaving training three Primal

1327
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:53,920
canes uh and allowing them to grow maybe

1328
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:56,400
five feet or so and in that 5T length

1329
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,838
there could be

1330
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:04,200
uh 20 nodes here this along this

1331
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:08,000
horizontal section and typically you

1332
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:12,838
expect to see about 75 70% of those

1333
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,798
lateral or axillary buzs to uh develop

1334
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:22,038
lateral shoots or secondary canes so in

1335
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:26,440
our system we're getting about

1336
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:29,240
uh seven probably of long lateral canes

1337
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,960
and since there are three Primal canes

1338
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:36,558
uh we could train

1339
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:39,039
about or 20 lateral canes up on this

1340
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:44,480
long rotating

1341
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,480
crossarm so I hope that had answer the

1342
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:53,519
question uh this is photo taking later

1343
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:57,480
in the summer uh early winter

1344
01:00:53,519 --> 01:01:00,199
uh showing that in this case we have

1345
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:03,199
trained two Primal

1346
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:05,960
canes and bent them to grow

1347
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:11,439
horizontally and then in this 5 foot

1348
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:13,798
span we have uh about 14 lateral canes

1349
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,119
that have developed and they tend to

1350
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:20,280
grow upright if you could you manage

1351
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,240
them properly and get tremendous length

1352
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,960
on these lateral canes here we got a

1353
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:30,959
lateral cane growing straight up to the

1354
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:33,960
top wire which is about five ft of

1355
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,960
of

1356
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:45,599
space so uh in this photo the plants

1357
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:48,000
have were established uh 6 feet apart

1358
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,000
within the

1359
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,519
row and once the lateral came hands are

1360
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:59,519
tie

1361
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:07,679
to the wires on this long rotating

1362
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:12,159
crossarm the entire crossarm could be

1363
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:16,038
rotated so that the uh the lateral canes

1364
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,038
are now very close to the

1365
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:31,159
ground and uh floating Roll Cover could

1366
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:34,798
be uh placed over these

1367
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:34,798
plants shown

1368
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:46,920
here and why do we do all this to grow

1369
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:51,358
blackberries in the Mid Atlantic coast

1370
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:53,720
region as I show you earlier uh

1371
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,880
varieties such as cisq and other

1372
01:02:53,719 --> 01:03:01,000
trailing black blackberries from

1373
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:03,400
Oregon are so uh tender that they're

1374
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,920
winterkilled like here shown with the

1375
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:11,760
Lal canes uh with no growth and that uh

1376
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,240
any Fring shoes that develop in the

1377
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,559
spring

1378
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:20,399
are are really uh

1379
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:23,240
in scarce on these L canes there are

1380
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:28,400
some flowering shoes or fru in shoes

1381
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:33,159
that develop on the main cane uh or the

1382
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,160
horizontal portion of the of the

1383
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,119
cane uh another question here is about

1384
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:40,119
cane

1385
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:47,519
breakage uh with this training system we

1386
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:50,440
rarely get uh cane

1387
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:54,838
breakage uh reason is

1388
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:57,519
that by bending the Primal canes

1389
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,278
to about 90 degrees and then forcing

1390
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,838
them those canes to grow

1391
01:04:00,278 --> 01:04:07,838
horizontally and then allowing the

1392
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:10,239
lateral canes to develop more in upright

1393
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:15,078
orientation

1394
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:17,479
uh allow us to rotate the entire canopy

1395
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:20,880
as much as

1396
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:24,278
110° without breaking the uh the main

1397
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,200
can because we're not really bending the

1398
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:33,440
cane doing this um canopy manipulation

1399
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:37,000
but uh twist uh twisting the canes so

1400
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,039
these canes tolerate more the twisting

1401
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,679
than actual bending so we are not

1402
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:46,839
getting much breakage there are some

1403
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:49,358
breakage uh during the uh early or early

1404
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:51,880
summer when the primary canes are being

1405
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,598
trained up and then bent to grow

1406
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:57,318
horizontally uh I think we have have

1407
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:59,960
shown that maybe we get about 5% or so

1408
01:04:57,318 --> 01:05:03,440
of the Primal canes break because of

1409
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:07,240
mishandling of these uh Primal canes uh

1410
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:11,639
during the bending operation but we lose

1411
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:14,598
very few canes if we lose one of those

1412
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:17,159
Primal canes or break cause break then

1413
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:20,200
we will then yank that cane out and

1414
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:22,719
allow another Prime that emerg from the

1415
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:26,000
crown to take its

1416
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:27,558
place uh but by using this type of

1417
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,318
training

1418
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:37,400
system uh we are able to uh get about 14

1419
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:41,400
15 pounds of fruit from cisu trailing

1420
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,200
Blackberry which is what uh is about an

1421
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,200
average production in

1422
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:49,278
Oregon and in the case of Triple Crown

1423
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:52,278
in Apache which do uh do not need any

1424
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:57,278
winter protection we have

1425
01:05:52,278 --> 01:06:01,519
harvested uh about 30 pounds of fruit uh

1426
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:01,519
per plant at 5 foot or six foot

1427
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:11,880
spacing so again uh show on the left

1428
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:16,160
plant uh that was not protected in the

1429
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:18,720
winter and then shown on the right uh

1430
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:22,399
plant that was trained on the RCA

1431
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:25,358
trellis with the can's position close to

1432
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,639
the ground and then cover with rotating

1433
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:32,519
with the floating Roll Cover we're

1434
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:32,519
getting uh good fruit

1435
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:40,359
production here are some data from our

1436
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:45,960
uh studies uh performed

1437
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:50,199
between uh year 2002 and uh

1438
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,199
2009 uh for variety

1439
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:58,519
ssq we are able

1440
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:03,880
to Advan the bloom by about seven seven

1441
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:06,599
days and and this is because uh this is

1442
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:11,318
caused by the uh application of roll

1443
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:14,440
covers up to uh early March or just

1444
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:17,358
prior to Bud break so by adding a little

1445
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:20,599
bit of fuel heat to the plant in early

1446
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:24,038
spring we're able to uh Advance their

1447
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:29,480
development uh and Achieve as much as

1448
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:33,000
one we uh earliness In Bloom and uh

1449
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,838
plants that were trained to the RCA

1450
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,599
trellis and then cover with ro floating

1451
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:41,880
Roll Cover in the winter produce 14

1452
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:45,680
pounds of fruit per plant now if you

1453
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:51,000
have the cisu train to a uh conventional

1454
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:52,919
trus or I or tle system and not cover uh

1455
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,278
those plants produce less than two

1456
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:59,760
pounds if they are uh trained to a

1457
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:01,599
upright cane training system and covered

1458
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,119
in a vertical

1459
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:08,599
orientation uh we got close to 5 pounds

1460
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:11,358
so uh at this low productivity it would

1461
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:14,000
not be worth uh growing uh varieties

1462
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:18,000
such as cisq in the system in here in

1463
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,759
the East but if they're trained to the

1464
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:27,679
RCA and covered during the winter months

1465
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:27,679
we can achieve uh much higher

1466
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:41,119
yield there are other benefits to uh RCA

1467
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:45,759
trell

1468
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:49,318
system one is uh that you can Harvest

1469
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:52,319
more fruit in a given time a given time

1470
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:56,080
uh data we have collected in the past

1471
01:08:52,319 --> 01:09:00,080
show that as much as 30% increase in

1472
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:05,479
Harvest efficiency this is due in part

1473
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:08,359
to having 90 95% of the fruit on one

1474
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:11,399
side of the row so you don't have to

1475
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,920
pick the rows of blackberries from both

1476
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,119
sides of the road but concentrate

1477
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,119
picking fruit from one side because

1478
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:22,838
almost all the fruit will be position on

1479
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:26,119
one side of the row and if RADS run east

1480
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:29,278
west and you could rotate the whole

1481
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:33,640
canopy to the north side of row uh fruit

1482
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:36,440
will be uh uh in a partial shade or

1483
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,319
complete shade and not be exposed to

1484
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:42,198
direct sunlight so there is less sunburn

1485
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:44,880
damage uh some of the temperatures we

1486
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:45,719
have fruit temperatures we have recorded

1487
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,359
in the

1488
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:53,880
summertime uh indicated that the fruit

1489
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:57,079
on the south side of the road uh had

1490
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:00,119
skin temperature as much as 20 to 25

1491
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:03,519
degrees higher than the fruit on the

1492
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:06,599
north side of row and imp partial

1493
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,120
shade so by having lower fruit

1494
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:13,560
temperature uh probably have a much

1495
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,559
better uh pulover sha

1496
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:22,639
life

1497
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:25,639
uh the things I have discussed

1498
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,640
today

1499
01:10:26,198 --> 01:10:35,839
is a non- tunnel winter protection uh

1500
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:40,880
system uh to reduce uh winter cane

1501
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:43,480
injury and uh reduce uh tissue uh

1502
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:48,119
dissocation during winter

1503
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:50,879
months it can be used to uh extend

1504
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:54,238
Blackberry production to areas with more

1505
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,679
severe winter conditions uh places like

1506
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:59,079
uh Northern Pennsylvania New York and

1507
01:10:56,679 --> 01:11:03,840
perhaps into New England

1508
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:07,279
states both erect and trading cultivars

1509
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:11,679
can be trained to RCA trellis and

1510
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:14,920
managed for with winter protection to uh

1511
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,920
improve uh

1512
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,920
productivity so that uh complet it's my

1513
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:30,279
presentation and we could take questions

1514
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:33,239
Dr taita there was one question about um

1515
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:38,079
was the conventional open treatment was

1516
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:38,079
that an open V or a different trellising

1517
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:47,760
system uh in this that study what we did

1518
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:52,560
was to train the uh lateral canes on the

1519
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:55,440
RCA cross arm and then uh left the canes

1520
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,159
upright to to the winter months instead

1521
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:02,359
of bringing them down and then either

1522
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,279
cover with roll cover or left open uh if

1523
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:07,679
you

1524
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:10,880
train blackberries to other system Pro

1525
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:15,039
probably get a similar results the canar

1526
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:19,600
are ver vertically trained and uh

1527
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:22,039
upright would uh be exposed to um much

1528
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,920
colder temperatures than the canes that

1529
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:27,920
are brought down close to the ground and

1530
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:30,639
covered with Roll Cover of snow in the

1531
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,760
winter all right does anybody else have

1532
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,800
any questions for Dr tequita I know we

1533
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,800
had a couple of unanswered questions for

1534
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,920
Dr

1535
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,360
pritz but now's your chance

1536
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,800
folks and it's too cold to go outside

1537
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:48,359
anyway so you might as well ask them

1538
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:53,719
okay what I think there was another uh

1539
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:58,679
question on yield uh we have uh plants

1540
01:12:53,719 --> 01:13:01,679
about 700 uh plants per acre density and

1541
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:06,480
in the case of Chester stoneless and

1542
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:11,039
Apache we have harvested about 30 lbs of

1543
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:14,678
fruit per uh yes 30 PBS in the case of

1544
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:16,238
cscq we're uh harvesting around 14

1545
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:19,800
lounds per

1546
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:22,238
plant and since these plantings were

1547
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,079
established for mechanical harvesting

1548
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:28,359
many years ago

1549
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:31,719
uh there planting RADS are about 12 ft

1550
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:34,158
apart but uh I'm sure these old these

1551
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:38,000
varieties could be grown at much uh

1552
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:41,679
closer spacing say about a 10ft row

1553
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,639
spacing all right that's great um I

1554
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,719
don't know Marvin if you're still there

1555
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:49,199
if you maybe as people type in questions

1556
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:52,000
for Dr teita but I know that there was a

1557
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:55,119
question earlier about the use of

1558
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,840
movable tunnels with raspberries or

1559
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:59,279
blackberries do you have any comments

1560
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,279
about

1561
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:06,158
that we don't have any experience with

1562
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,319
that but uh theoretically it's an

1563
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:13,119
intriguing idea uh particularly if you

1564
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:14,679
had the summer blackberries and the fall

1565
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,840
blackberries or summer raspberries and

1566
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:19,600
fall blackberries you could move the

1567
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,800
tunnel over the fall berries for just

1568
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,000
that late season crop for say from

1569
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,000
September through November to when you

1570
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,119
were done and then you could slide the

1571
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,158
tunnel back over the florane Fring crop

1572
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,079
that needed the winter protection and

1573
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:36,920
use it for that so you get double use

1574
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:38,238
out of the tunnel if you could have a

1575
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,440
rail system or something like that to

1576
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,799
slide it back and forth so or you know

1577
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:44,079
not even raspberries but you know greens

1578
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,560
or something that needed some winter

1579
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,359
protection so yeah it's an intriguing

1580
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,600
idea we haven't done it but people are

1581
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,920
talking about it and uh it'll be

1582
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,840
interesting the next couple of years to

1583
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,000
see if people figured out ways to make

1584
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,880
um I think there's a question here for

1585
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,840
Dr taito what is the best orientation to

1586
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,840
the sun uh in your opinion for those

1587
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,880
blackberries well if the uh if you are

1588
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,600
using the RCA

1589
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,119
trus

1590
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:18,400
we're recommending that the rose be

1591
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:21,679
established East West orientation so

1592
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:25,158
that the fruit could be positioned to

1593
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:28,520
the north side of the row

1594
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:28,519
uh about the disease

1595
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:37,158
pressures we thought but uh when we were

1596
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:41,638
doing mechanical harvesting work and uh

1597
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:43,479
rotated the fooding the cross arm to

1598
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:46,440
about a 30° about

1599
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:49,799
horizontal we we were getting a lot less

1600
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:52,839
Japanese Japanese beetle damage because

1601
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:56,440
the uh berries were all kind of hanging

1602
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,440
from the the uh

1603
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:06,279
canopy there's another concern though

1604
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:10,719
with the uh fungal problem such as

1605
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:13,158
anthos uh so roll covers must be removed

1606
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:17,600
just prior to Bud break in late winter

1607
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:22,119
or early spring then apply the uh the uh

1608
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,719
liquid lime sulfur to control anthos

1609
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:26,279
problems

1610
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,279
I'd like to jump in too because there

1611
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:32,198
was a question about insects in the high

1612
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,719
tunnel if we get increased insects and

1613
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:36,479
in our experience we get increased mites

1614
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,039
that we have to watch out for two

1615
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,279
spotted spider mites but otherwise we

1616
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,479
have uh very few other problems we've

1617
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,960
ever seen no diseases to manage and uh

1618
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:49,079
the only insect or increased mice

1619
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,679
because it's drier and warmer in the

1620
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:53,880
tunnel so we do have to pay attention to

1621
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:55,560
mites uh but nothing else and then I

1622
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,440
wanted to make a comment too about row

1623
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:01,360
orientation as fumi did we also

1624
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:04,198
recommend positioning our rows uh East

1625
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,238
West for the tunnel now if you're doing

1626
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:07,879
field production we recommend north

1627
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:10,638
south orientation because you get better

1628
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,760
line interception when the rows are

1629
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:15,719
planted north south so the south side of

1630
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,119
the roow and north side of the road get

1631
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:19,520
exposure when the sun comes up in the

1632
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:22,000
East and sets in the west but in a

1633
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,560
tunnel particularly late in the season

1634
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,760
if you want to get the most light

1635
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,280
intercepted when the sun's low in the

1636
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,880
south of the sky you want your rose

1637
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:34,479
planted East West so the south side of

1638
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:37,159
the east west row gets the most exposure

1639
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:39,158
to the southern Sun if you're going for

1640
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:41,479
that late there are a couple of

1641
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:44,279
questions I think for Dr teita talking

1642
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:47,718
about training this year's primocane

1643
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:51,238
over the top of next year's

1644
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:53,239
florane um and then wondering about

1645
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:56,039
trellising systems used in in the

1646
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:59,718
primacan production and I'm not I'm not

1647
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:03,238
completely sure um Dr

1648
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:04,960
tequito uh if I understand that question

1649
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:10,359
but

1650
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:11,560
well uh about the uh Prime training over

1651
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:14,238
next

1652
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,360
year's or not next year current Year's

1653
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:19,759
florane that's has

1654
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:22,719
fruit I would recommend that the uh this

1655
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,679
question they go to the uh some of the

1656
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,119
uh

1657
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:33,520
files that they could upload and these

1658
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:37,079
uh reports provide very detailed

1659
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:43,080
uh procedure for manipulating the canes

1660
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:47,119
but what the RC trollis has two wires at

1661
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:49,519
the height of that post the

1662
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:53,279
one training

1663
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,520
wire with on the side with a short arm

1664
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,039
that is the wire on which the Primal

1665
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,239
canes are

1666
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:04,079
trained okay and then the lateral canes

1667
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:09,718
that emerge from the horizontal portion

1668
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:14,198
of the Primal cane are trained to uh or

1669
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:16,560
contain their growth between the uh two

1670
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:19,000
cross arms the main the long cross arm

1671
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,320
and the short they got the angle created

1672
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,520
with the uh wires on them so you're

1673
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,960
trying to

1674
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,320
uh keep the prime those lateral canes

1675
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:34,319
growing with with within those two cross

1676
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:37,319
arms or angle created by those two uh

1677
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:40,479
arms of the trellis and then kind of

1678
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:44,559
confine their growth to to more or less

1679
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:47,439
the uh in a vertical uh

1680
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:50,039
Direction okay I hope

1681
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:52,399
that that helps and I do want to draw

1682
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:55,039
everybody's attention while you're in

1683
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,119
this phase of the program um you can

1684
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,479
click on these different handouts and

1685
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,000
bulletins there's quite a number of them

1686
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:04,799
some of them are a little a large but

1687
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,920
you can still click on them upload them

1688
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:10,239
right to your computer and I will keep

1689
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,399
the digital classroom open so that

1690
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,359
people can do that if they like but

1691
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,119
you'll also be able to do that from the

1692
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:21,519
archived presentation if you need to log

1693
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:23,399
off um there is a question about the how

1694
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,199
level does a site need to to be for a

1695
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,759
high tunnel can they be be placed on a

1696
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:31,039
slope um Marvin do you have any thoughts

1697
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,039
on

1698
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:37,960
that yeah I see uh a few questions here

1699
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:39,719
for me one is probably a level site is

1700
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,760
the most important thing you can have

1701
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:43,319
for a high tunnel when you buy these

1702
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,719
kits uh

1703
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,519
they're engineered for having a

1704
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:49,600
perfectly level site so if there's one

1705
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,480
thing you can do that's make sure that

1706
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,199
site is as level as possible it'll go up

1707
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:56,439
a whole lot better and be easier and I

1708
01:20:54,198 --> 01:20:57,799
haven't seen anybody placing them on a

1709
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,960
slope I think engine from the

1710
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,400
engineering point of view it' be just

1711
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,800
really hard to support that so level

1712
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:05,799
sight I think is critical uh the Charon

1713
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,800
system we used for the primee Blackberry

1714
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,880
production that was the system I showed

1715
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,960
you where we could basically train the

1716
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,199
canes upright but in into a v so we

1717
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,679
could bring some of the canes over to

1718
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:18,879
one side and some to the other but for

1719
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:20,560
pric cane blackberries mostly we're just

1720
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,000
interested in holding the canes upright

1721
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,360
we're not doing a whole lot of

1722
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,960
manipulation on primee fru and crops and

1723
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,158
then the question on rodents in high

1724
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:31,679
tunnel we're we mowed around the high

1725
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,679
tunnels real close to the ground to

1726
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:36,920
Grass before uh fall came and then we

1727
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:38,920
put up chicken wire around the outside

1728
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,158
to try to keep the rodents from coming

1729
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:44,359
in and we also tried to secure the

1730
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:45,638
tunnel itself as much as we could um and

1731
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:48,158
we'll just have to keep an eye on it to

1732
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,159
make sure it

1733
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,199
works oh and a question about the

1734
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,559
Chinese method based on on building the

1735
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,079
Earth on the north side of the tunnel

1736
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,639
and it's built into the slope that's

1737
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:02,679
true I've been to China and I've seen

1738
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:04,440
those but the tunnel itself is still the

1739
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:07,000
soil underneath it it's still Level it's

1740
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:09,759
still flat and they make that arch up

1741
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,039
and it goes into the bank uh and it's on

1742
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,400
slopes but the part that's planted is

1743
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:16,920
still pretty flat and level at least the

1744
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:18,799
tunnels that I saw over there okay um I

1745
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,840
did I I don't know if we answered one

1746
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:25,239
question about venting the tunnel in

1747
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,039
September and October and I I do believe

1748
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:29,439
that that's an important thing to be

1749
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:32,279
able to do I I don't know if um you want

1750
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:32,279
to comment on that

1751
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,560
Marvin yeah we keep the tunnels vented

1752
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,960
almost um I want to say year round but

1753
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,639
certainly when there's any amount of

1754
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,920
heat that can accumulate in a tunnel you

1755
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:48,079
want to keep it vented and we even on

1756
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:50,158
cold days say November we'll have the

1757
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,439
vents open at the top and we'll leave

1758
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:55,479
the sides up maybe 6 in so just to allow

1759
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,039
some air movement to come in and move

1760
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:59,839
through so it doesn't get so humid in

1761
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:02,119
there um and then when the really cold

1762
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,520
weather comes like we have now we'll

1763
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:06,079
have everything down to the ground and

1764
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,120
the vents closed but we try to vent a

1765
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,238
fair amount if nothing else to keep the

1766
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:12,079
humidity for moving through because the

1767
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,678
plants do better when the humidity is

1768
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:17,679
not too awfully high right um we have

1769
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:20,039
one more question uh for Dr teita which

1770
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:22,679
types of plants should be used erect

1771
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:22,679
semierect

1772
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:34,519
F

1773
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:38,479
me oh sorry yes uh yes uh I I

1774
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:41,320
think both types of varieties could be

1775
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:45,678
trained to RCA

1776
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:48,559
trellis uh even trailing blackberries

1777
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:52,480
work well when the

1778
01:23:48,560 --> 01:24:00,080
primes emerge from the crown and they

1779
01:23:52,479 --> 01:24:04,599
still 203 25 in tall uh they're all uh

1780
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:07,559
can they all can be bent about 90° to to

1781
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:11,520
force them to grow uh sideways or

1782
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:11,520
horizontally so

1783
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:19,158
uh they all can be trained to RCA

1784
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:22,760
Tris there are some cases where we do

1785
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:26,238
have problems which is are they could

1786
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:28,880
some vigorous primer canes emerge very

1787
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:30,119
early in the season they may be like 1

1788
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,800
in in

1789
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:36,559
diameter uh and they they're more

1790
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:39,400
difficult to bend than uh slightly

1791
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:42,520
smaller uh Primal

1792
01:24:39,399 --> 01:24:44,638
canes all right um I just put up the

1793
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,040
last poll I know that we're a little bit

1794
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,560
over on the time but I just think that

1795
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:51,039
the discussion and the questions have

1796
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,880
been great and I really appreciate

1797
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:56,079

bye

1826
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:06,840
fi I don't know if you see that question

1827
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:09,880
there's a question here from Brent Brett

1828
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,239
bindex about um growing a plant that

1829
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:15,000
produces 14 PBS versus a plant that

1830
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:18,599
produces 30 lbs I think what this

1831
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:21,639
individual is talking about is the um

1832
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,920
difference between a high tunnel and a

1833
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:25,679
regular

1834
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,679
just growing it

1835
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:31,479
outside oh

1836
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:35,198
well I think the question probably is

1837
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:38,599
relates to right cisu which produces 14

1838
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:43,000
PBS compared to triple crown or a patch

1839
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:47,000
that produ 30 so is he still ahead still

1840
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,118
I I could answer yeah Brent uh reason

1841
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,359
that we're trying to grow cisu in the

1842
01:27:49,118 --> 01:27:55,399
eastern United State is that it's a very

1843
01:27:52,359 --> 01:28:00,679
early ripening variety uh we could start

1844
01:27:55,399 --> 01:28:04,039
harvesting cisu here uh in mid June uh

1845
01:28:00,679 --> 01:28:07,199
compared to around July 10th for Apache

1846
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:10,158
and uh triple crown and much later for

1847
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:13,479
some other varieties so by growing

1848
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:17,960
trailing varieties such as cscu one

1849
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:21,479
could extend the picking season uh by uh

1850
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:24,439
2 3 weeks and get the early crop of

1851
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:27,399
BlackBerry before the Japanese beetles

1852
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:31,759
come out of the ground and cause a lot

1853
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:34,519
of problems and if you could pick black

1854
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,280
beers earlier in the summer I

1855
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:40,400
think the grower can get higher price

1856
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:42,960
for them for these early varieties well

1857
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:47,679
that answered it for me so I think it

1858
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:50,399
that was great thank you and um I think

1859
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,359
that's all the uh yeah I think everybody

1860
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:55,679
is pretty much signing off so again

1861
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:57,399
thank you so much Dr teita and Marvin

1862
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,520
