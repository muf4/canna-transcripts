1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,879
University yes so I'll introduce our

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,798
next speakers again this is uh Cornell

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,000
researchers and U just talking about

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,519
some of the work that they're doing um

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,800
with reading and so we are very um

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,278
fortunate to have Dr Jenny Moore here

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,000
with us uh Jenny Moore is an assistant

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,559
professor of plant breeding and genetics

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
at Cornell University uh her lab breeds

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,159
new propop varieties for organic and

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,679
sustainable cropping systems including

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,519
work on perennial forages cover crops

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,679
alternative and alternative crops of the

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,879
region uh Jenny also does a lot of work

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,759
um with looking at Harry vetch and so if

17
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,799
you have questions about Harry vet and

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,679
where things are going with the variety

19
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,878
development there she is the person to

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,479
talk with so um I also work with jnie on

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,759
some perennial grain Crop Production

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,439
some kernel work with through her her

23
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,719
students and uh yeah again really

24
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,399
fortunate to have Dr Moore here at

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,079
Cornell University uh also uh joining

26
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,000
the panel today or as part of this

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,280
research G grief we have uh Dr suve

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,359
Hansen uh who is a research support

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,200
specialist with uh Dr jinny Moore sve

30
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,319
joined the lab um in January 2023 where

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,079
she uh coordinates research and Outreach

32
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,319
for the Nationwide cover crop breeding

33
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,839
network uh solve uh earned her PhD in

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,919
plant reading and genetics from the

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,840
University of Wisconsin Madison in 2020

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,200
where she conducted genetic genomic and

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,680
participatory research focused on Flavor

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,680
in t table beads uh in her post doctoral

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,640
work at the University of British

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,040
Columbia she coordinated a canada-wide

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,478
farmer variety trialing Network so a lot

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,920
of uh experience working with farmers

43
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,359
and doing variety trials and

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,680
participatory breeding the other person

45
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:58,000
is SE sep so SE is a third-year PhD

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,560
student in plant breing and genetics

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,319
working with Dr Marcus oral on barley

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,478
genetics or organic and conventional

49
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,199
systems the goal of this work is to

50
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,159
release malting and naked barley

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,319
varieties adapted for the environmental

52
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,479
stresses uh present in New York State uh

53
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,159
one of the main goals is to introduce

54
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,840
preharvest sprouting resistance uh with

55
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,400
elongated dorcy uh to the breeding

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,598
program so very happy to have uh our

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,840
researchers here um from plant breeding

58
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,039
and genetics let's give them a round of

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,759
applause just to help welcome

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:37,120
my name I'm specialist in J's lab um I

61
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,439
work mostly with cover shops but when I

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,640
came here I was um glad to join project

63
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,719
um looking at andn LEL production uh in

64
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,719
in this area this

65
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,878
project Mar

66
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,639
and um hoping to find ways to diversify

67
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,158
both trop rotation and Market

68
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,919
opportunities for uh farmers in areas so

69
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:04,000
we looked at um we looked at both a

70
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,199
winter PE variety trial and a winter

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,919
lenal feeding rate study for both trials

72
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:14,039
we had um unarm or uh replicated plots

73
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,839
on our research stations so we could do

74
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,039
statistics and then we complemented

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,039
those with strip trials on Peter's Farm

76
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,120
to kind of give some context to what we

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,560
were seeing um on on the WE

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,519
station for the winter lentil trial you

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,039
could only really Source One winter Lal

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,080
variet um Morton which is a Turkish red

81
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,079
lentil we looked at different seaing

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,519
rates we had five rates which you'll see

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,680
there we um looked at St count in the

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,879
fall and spring and then we did hand

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Harvest on the on the research station

86
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:52,280
so we could separate um lentils and

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,360
weeds um first year we tried loal

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,680
monoculture all planted and we found a

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,239
lot of weeds uh we found and as a result

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,360
of all those weeds uh find meat and

91
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,200
chick meat on replicated plots there a

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,879
lot of field Daisy and Peter plots we

93
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,438
saw no significant difference for any

94
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,239
trait that we tried to measure because

95
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,519
the weed pressure just was too strong

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,918
but um great learning experience we

97
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,120
figured uh maybe to get the L A fighting

98
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,159
chance we need to add uh a nurse

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,360
crop so for the second year uh we did

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,720
that we added winter Oak and uh it

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,720
worked right so

102
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,240
oops well the point is not going work

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,759
for me but you can see that as the

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,759
seeding ring goes up so does the plant

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,038
population so that works using the using

106
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,160
witer o as the nurse crop allowed the

107
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,839
LEL to establish and then we were able

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,000
to answer this question if we increased

109
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,198
plant density do we also increase rental

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,720
yield and the answer

111
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,879
is kind of conclusive so you'll see that

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,199
this table was sorted by um by letal

113
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:11,839
yield and you know the the highest

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,478
numerical yield was from the 55 pounds

115
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,959
an acre uh treatment which was the

116
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,918
highest seeding rate but you'll see that

117
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,159
that we a 63 plant per quadrant right

118
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,240
which is about double what we have from

119
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,439
40 pound seeding rate but the radial

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,120
didn't increase uh by that uh for at all

121
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,439
and we didn't see any statistically

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,160
significant differences between any of

123
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:41,439
these so um our best we don't have great

124
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,680
evidence that seeding more than 40

125
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,079
pounds an acre is worth it we only

126
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,000
really have one year of data on this so

127
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,560
it's um inconclusive we'll look at the

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,160
on Farm results so Peter did get the

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,879
highest yield at 55 PBS an acre but the

130
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,960
next highest was the 40 pounds an acre

131
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,560
Peter did you come to a conclusion as to

132
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,120
what what seaing rate you would use in

133
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,319
the future last fall I planted 40 pounds

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
okay the cost of seed is high enough

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,240
that

136
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:19,918
exra yeah good

137
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,439
um so I looked at um lenal yield data

138
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,598
collected by the USDA they collect lenal

139
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,399
yield data in like four Western and uh

140
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:32,199
great PL States and those averaged

141
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,598
between 600 1100 pounds per acre so so

142
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,639
we're really right in that range um

143
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,000
which is pretty cool that we can get

144
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,918
those yields

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,598
here um so biggest conclusions from The

146
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,839
lenal Trial use a nurse crop to get them

147
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:49,079
to establish and we didn't see great

148
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,799
evidence that anything any seating rate

149
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:56,279
greater than 40 pound is going to be

150
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,160
with for the wi gra pees we were able to

151
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,839
Source a great number of varieties we

152
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
sourced these from Pro

153
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,719
um if I understand your original

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,919
question the most commonly planted R out

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,479
here is

156
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:15,959
Keystone um where's just spoke you broke

157
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,959
yeah what do you

158
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,240
brow a this was

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,080
focused entirely

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,360
on

161
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,120
all okay great um so our question was

162
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,960
can we find uh

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,519
variety uh that will be better than he

164
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,399
for

165
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,719
you so the first year we saw significant

166
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,560
differences for all the traits we

167
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,560
measured except for we biomass so that's

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,680
satisfying um we saw some Trends we saw

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,800
that I kind of gave these a an Olympic

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,439
metal ranking so the first group are

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,199
shorter plants with more stems they did

172
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,598
best for yield and best for protein

173
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,639
content there's a middle ranking the

174
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:04,918
silver ones are taller plant with fewer

175
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,560
stems uh also lower protein content and

176
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,918
then some lower performance at the

177
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,519
bottom so and we got similar results on

178
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,399
the farm so all the all the varieties in

179
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,079
each of these groupings are the same

180
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,959
even though Peter had a slightly smaller

181
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,918
subset on the farm so we were thinking

182
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,318
like hey maybe we're discovering some

183
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:27,598
some a real Trend um but then came year

184
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,840
two we um our field on the research

185
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:34,240
station was much wetter but for prone to

186
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:36,278
disease um so the the varieties that

187
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,479
really did well were the indeterminate

188
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,599
Vining ones that can kind of grow out of

189
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,680
the out of the disease there was a lot

190
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,560
of lodging uh some of the more

191
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,838
determinant varieties the semi leafless

192
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,278
ones um they they detached from the soil

193
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,720
at the soil level there was so much uh

194
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:56,159
soilborne disease so so that drove these

195
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,639
results um the two varieties that did

196
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:02,439
really well houstone icicle and icicle

197
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,838
um were those long IND determinate

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,360
varieties you can see the the strong

199
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,160
difference between the plant height and

200
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,839
the Pres uh standing which is you know

201
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:15,519
the inverse of lodging um so in

202
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,760
different conditions different uh plant

203
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,320
architecture function ve important to

204
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,439
realize that Harvest is a lot more

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,680
difficult for these plots because they

206
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,959
were so voluminous and finy um we did

207
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,799
mechanical Harvest on these with great

208
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,479
effort with a flot harvester that we

209
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,078
borrowed from uh the sorl team and uh

210
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,600
your Harvester did fine do you want to

211
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,759
talk about what you use uh we have a

212
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,759
honey be FX scraper with an air reil and

213
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,559
I really upset them when I sent them a

214
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,838
video of just cruising through the plots

215
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,719
no problems at all yeah we're like

216
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,920
feeding it in with like a t grw it was

217
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,079
ridiculous um but okay so we on the

218
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,838
research station we measured field

219
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,039
differently the two years so first year

220
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,480
we had much more controlled plant size

221
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,159
so we did quadrat Harvest second year

222
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,839
massive plants we did mechanical Harvest

223
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,719
but we could rank uh which varieties

224
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,600
yielded best or in which order in in

225
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,800
both years and you can see by all this

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
crossover that some varieties did much

227
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,759
better in the drier year some VAR did

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,159
much better in the weather conditions

229
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,240
but we do find some nice horizontal

230
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:30,399
lines so herwood and Goldenwood were the

231
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,360
ones that did um

232
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,159
well or it um slightly above average in

233
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
both years in both those dryer

234
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,838
conditions and the letter one he Stone

235
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,399
was more like a relatively stable

236
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,320
variety but it was slightly below

237
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:49,720
average in yield both years so

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,600
um these are heater results both similar

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,240
variety ranking over both years um have

240
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
you decided whether you're going to

241
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,079
change varieties from

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,720
Keystone I didn't actually plant any

243
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:06,958
this fall because we kind of got and we

244
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,278
don't have a market right now got it's

245
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,879
something that we probably will look at

246
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,039
again Keystone was good the issue I've

247
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,720
had with Keystone is Keel which we

248
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,078
haven't touched on but it's a major

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,320
problem yeah

250
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,439
um I wonder do you think that's

251
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,839
different between varieties did you I

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,959
suspect that we're going to see be

253
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,920
Weevil in any of the yellows or greens

254
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,439
because they're more palatable that the

255
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,319
be

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,480
yeah sounds right that's the whole

257
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,120
another front here um also see dramatic

258
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,120
differences in yield levels between y

259
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,078
years so the the second year yields you

260
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,759
know between a th000 and 2,000 pounds

261
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:50,078
are also in line with um the USDA

262
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:54,039
average yields for the western state um

263
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:56,239
the AL of line um the first year was a

264
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,439
real bust you had a hypothesis on why

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,440
that was

266
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,839
that you grew them with tral the first

267
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,518
year and O the second year yeah okay so

268
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,760
the I think that there might be an aathy

269
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,839
between the tral and the winter peas

270
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,000
that suppress the the

271
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,959
peas uh the winter oats are something

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,759
that we've been working on we had oat

273
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,958
contamination that survived winter and

274
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,679
some of our wheat in

275
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:32,319
2021 we've been developing that

276
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,559
line um oats can have aathy but I am

277
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,079
hypothesizing that it does not have an

278
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,319
allopathic effect against the peas which

279
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,719
didn't suppress the peas peas were able

280
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
to do a lot better in the spring when

281
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,639
they came out of door yeah that's

282
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,599
interesting because you know we grew our

283
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,519
research class was Cil as well but it

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,278
was a different Tri than you were using

285
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,919
I believe yeah so that could be one of

286
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,559
those variety crop uh interactions like

287
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,599
we're talking about the sunflowers and

288
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,838
Rye um we seen that in other oopy

289
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,519
research that it is very C of our

290
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,720
specific C of our in species specific

291
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,679
another thing to consider because these

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,040
are being grown for food production is

293
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,198
that a lot of the Lille and B markets

294
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,838
are looking for if not certified gluten

295
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:21,159
free some assurance that it is gluten

296
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,199
free and if we're

297
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,879
using critical that is a glutenous grain

298
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,359
if we're using oats that is not a

299
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,919
glutenous grain so it may give an easier

300
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,519
entry into the market Market that's a

301
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,759
great Dynamic to consider and they're a

302
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,320
lot easier to separate because TRL test

303
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:43,319
weight and P test weight are too similar

304
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:46,240
old T and T are

305
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,879
quite good stuff thank you so so here

306
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,159
kind of the conclusions from the P trial

307
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,278
um performance really differ by the

308
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,278
amount of moisture um and the and the P

309
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,240
type so semi leaflets more determinate

310
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,679
versus Le uh normal leafy and and left

311
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,399
ter it you have extended results on

312
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,078
those handouts if you want to dig into

313
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,879
bigger and yield and uh protein content

314
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,278
and things like that but I will leave it

315
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,919
here and then I'll take a question or

316
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,600
two if there are some while we get

317
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,719
presentation

318
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,720
up anybody else yeah wondering about

319
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
using

320
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:33,519
where yes I know but but why would you

321
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,919
do that because spring outs are nice

322
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,720
they might grow more vigorously than

323
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:40,399
they die and leaving everything be

324
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,160
cleaner and easier I don't know question

325
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,360
yeah I like to have Ys out there because

326
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,600
it aids and

327
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,440
harvest so the spring Oak there's a

328
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,639
concern of smother when it when it

329
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,000
winter kils because it's especially L

330
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,360
growing Point remains under the surface

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,440
over winter and if they have a hard time

332
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,560
pushing out of that dead Mulch and be

333
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,759
worried about getting started uh that

334
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,838
winter also creates just a lot more

335
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,320
biomass P into the combine so that you

336
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,360
don't lose as many l shattering because

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,079
land are extremely from the shattering

338
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,079
once they're right

339
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,600
offs they at the

340
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,078
[Music]

341
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,519
same this past year was kind of an

342
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,159
anomaly on every front but they did

343
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,480
right together fairly

344
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,000
nice but for the L

345
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,240
it was definitely a Liv curve for me

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,679
trying to identify when they're ready

347
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,318
because like the lower part of the plant

348
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,879
is still greenish and the upper part is

349
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,198
yellowish Brown the the pods are brown

350
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,399
but the rest of the plant is not and if

351
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,278
you wait till the whole plant's Brown

352
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,278
all the all the seeds already on the

353
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:53,519
ground um so yeah that's something

354
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,958
something to learn yeah there is another

355
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,639
effect or benefit from the HS and that's

356
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,958
it it does provide some biology in the

357
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
soil it suppresses

358
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,518
insects so in addition to suppressing

359
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,679
weeds it's also suppressing some of the

360
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,159
diseases in

361
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:14,799
insect thank

362
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:18,318
you one more used to go PE and Oaks and

363
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:21,479
just were a pretty good separation was

364
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,799
it was course it's not like a met put

365
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,360
the rotary scen scen

366
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,519
cleaner and had

367
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,318
a I don't know

368
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,318
was something by three so

369
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,518
[Music]

370
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,839
the that's how we briefly before we

371
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,560
bring them into the plan so that it's

372
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,560
lasts of the load

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,440
on I'll be there

374
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:01,120
talk being here and thanks for talking

375
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,639
about our our project um I'm going to be

376
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,880
transitioning back to talking more about

377
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,120
ride which we've talked about quite a

378
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,079
bit this morning already um before I do

379
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,359
that um I just want to mention sort of

380
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,599
the broader work that we're doing on

381
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,000
cover reading I I won't talk about the

382
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,038
other species that we're working on in

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,400
our lab but just to say that sve and I

384
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,359
uh together lead the the cover crop

385
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,519
reading Network which is this National

386
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,839
group of plant readers and farmers and

387
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,160
agronomists and whole bunch of folks um

388
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,480
all working to develop improved cover

389
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,679
crup varieties and the network started

390
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,480
out working on on winter annual Lum so

391
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,480
we so we initially started doing

392
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,000
breeding work on vetch PE and crimson

393
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,919
clover um and then the last few years

394
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,759
we've added Ry and and winter canola as

395
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,400
as additional species in the network um

396
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,839
and so the work that I'm presenting

397
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,559
today was kind of some initial work that

398
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,359
we started doing as we were getting to

399
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:05,480
know Ry as a as a cover crop um species

400
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,279
and getting to know the genetics and and

401
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,558
Management Systems in our lab and and um

402
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,918
the work was supported by U the USDA um

403
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,960
organic research and extension

404
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,000
initiative

405
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,640
Ori as well as the Northern New York egg

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,798
development program um so so you'll see

407
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,440
the a lot of the work happened in the

408
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:31,679
northern TI of the state um and

409
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,640
yeah so this this figure is probably not

410
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,200
news to to most people in the room that

411
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,120
Ry is um by far the top of planted

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,679
coverop in the US um and so that was one

413
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:45,839
of the the main motivations for adding

414
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,440
Ry to our breeding Network um it's

415
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,798
planted on a lot of acor and a lot of

416
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,880
potential impact if we can improve the

417
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,720
species um

418
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
and um you know for a lot of the reasons

419
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,880
that that Erin mentioned at the

420
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,120
beginning of her talk it's you know

421
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,799
consistent winter hardy very productive

422
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,399
cover crop um has a lot of a lot of

423
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,879
Applied in a lot of different ways on on

424
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,360
different Farms um and naron was also

425
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,799
mentioning that you know the challenge

426
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,759
of um or the importance of planting in a

427
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,599
timely fashion um getting it in you know

428
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,679
ideally in mid September um which can be

429
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,399
a challenge depending on the rotation

430
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,320
that it's planted in and um as as a

431
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,360
plant breeder I'm always looking at

432
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,678
things with the lens of um how do we use

433
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,879
genetics um as a tool to to either

434
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,240
improve the performance of cover crops

435
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,679
or um or make it easier for Farmers that

436
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,839
are not yet using cover crops to

437
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,919
incorporate in the

438
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,839
location um and

439
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,880
so um we know as as Aaron was talking

440
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,720
about that that biomass shows some

441
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,960
pretty clear um declines with later

442
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
planting dates um and this has

443
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,558
implications for the benefits that

444
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,440
you're you're getting from cover crops

445
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:05,879
certainly um weed management um and this

446
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,759
is a figure from from stud in Alabama

447
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,960
but we see you know same Trends um in

448
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,240
other regions as well including here the

449
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,798
dates are different obviously um and

450
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,400
then and this second figure is a is from

451
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:26,798
a meta analysis um uh in in the US

452
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:30,960
Midwest um and you know we see that at

453
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:34,558
this um you know 4,500 pounds per acre

454
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,000
that um we can see a 75% reduction in

455
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,279
bco in this particular um you know set

456
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,919
of studies that was the target I know

457
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,879
Aon talked about much higher levels of

458
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,120
biomass and you know that's um you know

459
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,039
this is thisis I don't think was

460
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:52,839
specific to noil systems so um certainly

461
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:55,400
for those systems you may um need to

462
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,000
achieve higher levels of biomass and so

463
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,200
um yeah so so certainly depending on the

464
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,839
application you might be looking for for

465
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,440
different um performance of the cover

466
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,959
crft um for the purposes of my

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:15,080
presentation um I I thought about this

468
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,000
4500 pound per acre Target number um and

469
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,439
uh yeah I'd be really interested to hear

470
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,240
what other folks are targeting in

471
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,919
different systems and and the the data

472
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,880
that I'm presenting this is you're

473
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,320
getting the hot off the presses so this

474
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,080
is analysis that um I I've just started

475
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,319
doing the first time I'm presenting it

476
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,399
so I'll I'll be really I'm excited to

477
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,000
get feedback from folks about um how you

478
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,919
might want to see uh the data analyze

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,359
differently or what kind of context is

480
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,038
important to consider as we're thinking

481
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:48,879
about these numbers um but so so my

482
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,640
question really is um we started out

483
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,240
thinking about um whether variety

484
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,480
selection can improve performance at

485
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,240
later planting so so acknowledging the

486
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,038
reality that sometimes the the

487
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,480
mid-september date isn't realistic in a

488
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,440
specific you know a given system or a

489
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,159
given year um can we still

490
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
achieve uh you know sufficient levels of

491
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,640
biomass to see some benefits even if we

492
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:20,798
plant a little bit later um uh and and a

493
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,038
lot of the um R cover crops that are

494
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,759
that are planted um are with variety not

495
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:29,119
stated seeds so we're not

496
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:34,240
um uh using this this tool of of

497
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:36,959
genetics to to um you know Target and

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,519
improve the system um and a lot of the

499
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,038
studies that we've seen that that have

500
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,000
evaluated planting dates are are testing

501
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,359
just one or or very few R varieties and

502
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,400
so so not really accounting for potent

503
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,798
potential genetic variability within the

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,559
species um so so what we wanted to know

505
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,440
is is there variability among R

506
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,960
varieties that are already on the market

507
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,159
for performance when they're planted

508
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,440
later and uh can um varieties be planted

509
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,000
late and still accumulate enough biomass

510
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,400
to to provide some value for

511
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,159
Farms um and so we did a a planting date

512
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:17,840
by variety experiment over a couple of

513
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:20,559
years um so we we planted um here we go

514
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,439
so so we planted in two years so fall

515
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,158
2022 was the first year that we planted

516
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,840
the

517
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,480
experiment um we continue the the next

518
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,839
season as well we planted

519
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,000
um on four dates so late September early

520
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,240
October mid October and and late October

521
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,720
to early November so so that first

522
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,359
planting date might be in the so so we

523
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,120
targeted around September 25th which I

524
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:48,000
think is the um a recommended kind of

525
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,519
deadline uh from nrcf nrcf so all of the

526
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,079
later planting dates are in these really

527
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:56,879
marginal times not ideal not recommended

528
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:59,639
generally um and we planted again a

529
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,679
seaing rate that's lower than um what

530
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Erin was describing so this is also

531
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
based on nrcs recommendations I'm not

532
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,558
specific to noil so so would take

533
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,639
results with a grain of salt if that's

534
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:14,158
the system that you're um that you're

535
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,600
targeting um and so you you might see

536
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,400
higher biomass values at a given date if

537
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,000
you're planting at these higher feeding

538
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,440
rates that that you might need for Noel

539
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,119
um but I would expect that the the

540
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,200
trends may be similar um but at you know

541
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,639
higher higher final back biomas at

542
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,159
higher seaing rates um so we planted

543
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,278
this experiment at three research Farms

544
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,840
so the Freeville research Farm cl to IA

545
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:44,558
and then at the extension Learning Farm

546
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:49,480
in Canton and the shayy that the minor

547
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:51,960
Institute in shayy New York um and uh we

548
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,640
also planted um not a planting data

549
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,038
experiment but just the same varieties

550
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,360
on free Farms as well I'm not going to

551
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,038
present the on Farm data because I

552
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,240
really wanted to focus on this planting

553
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,200
date question um but just to say that we

554
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,880
saw fairly similar variety rankings on

555
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,080
the farms as well

556
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,799
um and we planted six varieties in the

557
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,398
first year and then added eight more in

558
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:18,519
the second year um

559
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:22,079
and yeah so I I'll get into the results

560
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:24,119
so the first thing we as expected we saw

561
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,199
these um you know planting data effects

562
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,000
that in general at the sites we saw um

563
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,399
declining biomass later dates um the

564
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,759
exception we had one year where um in

565
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,278
shayz where we had some disease issues

566
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,158
and a couple of the earlier planting

567
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,240
dates so they had more comparable

568
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:42,640
performance across the dates um there

569
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,240
were differences but they weren't in the

570
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:51,038
order we expected um so so that's a

571
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,679
caveat for that that site um and variety

572
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,679
also was clearly important across all of

573
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,360
the sites um so variety variety did

574
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,080
matter in terms of the final biomass

575
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,479
production um and in most cases we

576
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,439
didn't see an interaction between

577
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,319
planting dat and variety um this

578
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,038
indicated to me that that you could

579
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,398
plant the same

580
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,398
variety the same varieties were the best

581
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:17,239
regardless of the date you planted them

582
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:20,479
so you don't necessarily need to switch

583
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,558
varieties if you realize that you're um

584
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,278
that you're going to have to plant L um

585
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,240
he would he would plant the same same

586
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:29,599
variety regardless of the

587
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,880
timing um the exception was in in

588
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:36,158
Freeville in the second year we did see

589
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,640
some rank changes although uh to the

590
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,559
groupings remained pretty similar

591
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,759
um

592
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,759
and okay so getting into the

593
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,759
nitty-gritty of the of the variety

594
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,798
performance at site so I'll go over

595
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,200
first the the sites that didn't have any

596
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:57,599
interaction effect

597
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,840
um and uh first I would say so so in

598
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,798
Canton we had had really low biomass

599
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:06,359
production across all of the dates and

600
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,879
varieties so um yeah although the the

601
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,359
rankings the variety rankings were quite

602
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,039
similar across the different sites um I

603
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,079
would call the Canton PL a failed a

604
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,798
failed establishment across the board so

605
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:23,079
I'm not going to focus on that data and

606
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,119
I also think that the the data in the

607
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,639
first year in chayz is a little bit less

608
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,558
interesting because

609
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,000
everything did pretty well um so

610
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,678
everything surpassed that 4500 pounds

611
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,679
per acre biomass threshold regardless of

612
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,798
planting data and variety um so so this

613
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,038
data is maybe um doesn't really help us

614
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,918
answer the question as much either um so

615
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:51,200
it's these remaining sites where we had

616
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,200
um you know we were right at that

617
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,240
threshold of the um you know the the

618
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,679
minimum recommended biomass um and some

619
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,399
varieties on some dates were were

620
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,200
performing above the threshold and some

621
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:07,319
were performing below um so the first

622
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,319
site I'll talk about the second year in

623
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,639
Shay um the most interesting planting

624
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,918
date was this October

625
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,840
17th um date so this was the third

626
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,759
planting date in the experiment and

627
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:26,079
about half of the variety still

628
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:30,359
surpassed that 4500 pounds per acre um

629
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,720
threshold and um and the the threshold

630
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,158
if we change the threshold we'll see a

631
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,440
different number of varieties but that

632
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,919
that really um that planting date had

633
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,840
the most variability um the data in the

634
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,919
table are the average across the date

635
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,439
but I've highlighted in the boxes the

636
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,000
ones that um that still pass the

637
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,960
threshold on that third planting day so

638
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,119
so even in in mid October they were able

639
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,319
to produce um a pretty decent amount of

640
00:28:54,119 --> 00:29:02,398
biomass um and

641
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:06,240
uh in Freeville in the first year um the

642
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:09,479
the second planting on October 12th um

643
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,000
we only had two varieties Elvin and Andy

644
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,159
Garder um that surpassed that that

645
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,720
threshold um and

646
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,039
then um the last site is the one that

647
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,038
had the interaction effect so that's um

648
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:28,480
the B that is here and again so there's

649
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:31,119
some dates so the this first date um all

650
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,399
of the varieties surpassed that that

651
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:39,398
4500 pounds per acre uh and then in B

652
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:41,359
three and four nothing did um but at the

653
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:44,719
second planting date which was October

654
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:47,839
4th um again about half of the variety

655
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,440
past that threshold um and you can

656
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,158
see um there are some common varieties

657
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,519
that that met that threshold across

658
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,760
these um you know three

659
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,759
different uh

660
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:04,679
you know marginal planting dates at

661
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:08,679
these three locations so so Andy Gardner

662
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:13,559
and elbon um in all three years uh were

663
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:16,399
among the top performers and and um and

664
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,480
surpass that threshold and Ryan and ren

665
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,918
bruzi were only planted in the second

666
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,079
year um but in those uh those years that

667
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,640
they were pledged they also performed

668
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,240
quite well

669
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,159
um and

670
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,440
yeah so so to me this says that there is

671
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,120
you know potential for genetics to help

672
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,919
push the the boundaries and allow um on

673
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,119
these marginal dates um suboptimal dates

674
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,919
that you still could if you plant an

675
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,639
appropriate variety um could see better

676
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,200
performance than um than with other

677
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,399
varieties

678
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,360
um and so then I I I want to talk

679
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:00,638
briefly about the the breeding work that

680
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,959
we're doing on this front so um we we in

681
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:05,479
addition to evaluating varieties that

682
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,880
already exist on the market for this

683
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,038
performance at later planting dates we

684
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,519
also want to know if we can actually um

685
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,638
intentionally breed to improve

686
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:17,319
performance of Ry at Le

687
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:22,000
plantings um so this this is work that's

688
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:24,879
led by my PhD student Roa Papa and she

689
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,638
as part of this um northern New York

690
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,559
funded project uh planted a Nursery um

691
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:36,240
at the willsboro research Farm um along

692
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,038
Lake Champlain and um we we planted both

693
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,880
at this you know very more Northern

694
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,398
location than where we are in Nia and at

695
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,559
a later date um in the hopes that we

696
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,558
would um experience some challenging

697
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,918
conditions and really Challenge and

698
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:52,038
stress our our Ry nursery and be able to

699
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:56,080
make some good selections for more um

700
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:59,558
winter hardy and productive varieties um

701
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:04,038
and uh we we've had our first winter

702
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:05,599
Nursery there last year and we're um

703
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,798
we've now planted an

704
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,759
evaluation of that population but we

705
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,119
also have um some populations that we've

706
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,919
selected in a controlled environment so

707
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,759
so one concern with um you know any of

708
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,000
our work selecting for improved winter

709
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:24,119
heiness um or or improved germination

710
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,679
under cold conditions uh is that

711
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,959
environmental conditions are variable we

712
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,038
can't predict when we're going to have a

713
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,840
good selection year and so we want to um

714
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:34,158
develop tools that we can can more

715
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,959
predictably make good selections and so

716
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,720
we've been evaluating this tool called

717
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,558
the thermog gradient table um to see if

718
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,278
that can help us do this work more

719
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:49,240
efficiently and predictably so this is

720
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:51,480
basically a a table that has um tubing

721
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,278
running running underneath and we we

722
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,639
have temperature control baths that um

723
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:59,079
circulate through the table so we can

724
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,798
control the temperature and have you

725
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:04,319
know quite quite cold soil temperatures

726
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,440
um and we can also have a gradient of

727
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,519
different temperatures so we can

728
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,080
evaluate the same material um in the

729
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,519
same experiment across multiple

730
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:17,079
temperatures and um so we basic we

731
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:22,120
planted a a mini Nursery um in the in

732
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:24,558
the table and um evaluating germination

733
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:28,119
and and vigor at very cold temperatures

734
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:30,359
so um close to freezing and you know we

735
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,000
in some cases had like ice formation on

736
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,199
the the top of the surface of the table

737
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,278
and still had Ry plants emerging which

738
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,558
is pretty cool to see it's a definitely

739
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:42,200
a a hearty resilient plant and um so so

740
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,440
we have a couple of cycles of selection

741
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,679
from this uh uh breeding approach and

742
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,759
what we're going to be comparing um this

743
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,200
coming spring uh the performance of both

744
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,759
the controlled environment selections

745
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,960
and the field selections evaluating it

746
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,839
in willsboro and in the table to see how

747
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,720
correlated the the selections are

748
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,839
between controlled environment and field

749
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,440
so so not only can we select things in

750
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,519
the controlled environment but does that

751
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,440
actually translate to improve field

752
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:14,480
performance or not so um yeah they'll be

753
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,320
data next year hopefully at this meeting

754
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,719
um to to tell you the answer to that

755
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,800
question but um yeah really excited

756
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,279
about this area of research and um yeah

757
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,879
looking forward to learning more and I

758
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,800
will leave it there um to again thank

759
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,118
the the folks who have supported this

760
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,119
project through collaboration and

761
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,240
funding and I also want to put a plugin

762
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:43,000
we we just this week uh uh started

763
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,638
Distributing a survey focused on on Ry

764
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,398
and to guide the ride breeding

765
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,000
priorities of this new program uh and

766
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,319
we're looking for for Farmer input on on

767
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,918
breeding priorities but also you know

768
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,960
folks in the seed industry or extension

769
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,358
anybody that's working with um people

770
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,599
that are producing Ry or processing Ry

771
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:07,920
or um yeah working uh with Ry in and

772
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,400
various um types of businesses and and

773
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,838
education and things like that so um if

774
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,800
you if you interact with Ry um please

775
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,799
follow the QR code and um and let us

776
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,880
know what you think and yeah we really

777
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,839
appreciate your input and it'll um guide

778
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,039
the future work that our is doing thanks

779
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,039
very much

780
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,880
that's a good question I we do have soil

781
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,760
data and I I didn't analyze it it

782
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,680
included here um certainly the soil

783
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,440
types are different I couldn't tell you

784
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,358
exactly what the different soil types

785
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,318
are the different locations I think also

786
00:35:54,358 --> 00:36:01,719
like the the um our failed site uh I

787
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,400
think had some fertility issues I would

788
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,439
I would guess that's why we had such low

789
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,240
biomass production um compared to the

790
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,519
other sites but yeah and the Freeville

791
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:16,399
location is is very grally

792
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:20,318
the yeah and the the Shady location has

793
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,318
pretty nice soil

794
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,409
[Music]

795
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,839
yeah yeah for sure

796
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,280
um yeah and and I was surprised at how

797
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,239
much we had overlapping varieties that

798
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,040
were the top performers given the huge

799
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,519
variability in the state and yeah we

800
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,039
know we had very different soil

801
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:02,838
conditions and weather conditions in the

802
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:04,559
different sites but um yeah it seemed

803
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,039
promising to me it's only two years of

804
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,519
data but promising that there were some

805
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,440
varieties that were fairly consistently

806
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:17,318
High performers um even at those late

807
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:19,760
days yeah yeah um hi everybody my name

808
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,079
is C I'm a thirdy year PhD student

809
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,599
working in small grain breing Eng

810
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,640
gentics lab uh just wanted to mention

811
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,318
here originally B and ra is also an

812
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,719
organic farm in southwest

813
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:34,079
Estonia so I know what you guys are

814
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,118
dealing with and interestingly the

815
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,440
problems are really similar to what we

816
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,838
work with here in New York um in terms

817
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,358
of breing so what I'm mainly going to

818
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,838
talk about today is naked barley but uh

819
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:50,719
the small brainy

820
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:53,318
program at Corell is actually coming

821
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:57,039
from 1906 so it's more than 100 years

822
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:59,000
old which is really fascinating for me

823
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,800
and has a focus on investigating small

824
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,800
grains and releasing varities adapted to

825
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,599
local conditions for a while

826
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:12,480
now um but more than 11 19 years

827
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,640
later uh what's happening today at our

828
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,960
breing program is uh mostly focus on

829
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,358
breeding winter wheat molting barley

830
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,199
organic naked barley that's what I'm

831
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,440
going to talk about today and also MRI

832
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,279
cor

833
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,358
spell and meanwhile with those varieties

834
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,319
we're also trying to

835
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:35,199
um combine that with u the latest

836
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:39,199
research that's available to improve our

837
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,480
bring program as well as we can with

838
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,159
some of those topics that we are

839
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,440
focusing like appli reading methods

840
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,559
mular

841
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,079
genetics uh characterizing different

842
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,719
traits that are important and also

843
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,160
determination and M quality which has

844
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:58,358
been one of my focuses

845
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:01,318
um just to kind give a little bit of

846
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,960
background why we any want to go bar at

847
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:06,159
all um I guess we've heard a lot about

848
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,000
having crops that out there on the field

849
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,039
of the winner uh gives dep Department a

850
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,318
good weed

851
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:16,519
suppression um improves the soil

852
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:19,239
Health also enables us to break the

853
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,599
disease and pest Cycles out there but I

854
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,279
think with bar there's a little B more

855
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,800
than that as an example I think bar is

856
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,280
one of the most adaptable varieties get

857
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,960
that one anybody put out Thunder Fields

858
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,880
um has relatively low inputs and really

859
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,880
can survive on a variety of soils and

860
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,280
environmental conditions out

861
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,160
there uh meanwhile then product itself

862
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,240
can be used for several different um

863
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:49,799
causes uh like mouting that has been one

864
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:52,879
of our main uh interest in our lab uh

865
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,720
animal feed and also food

866
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,280
production and to kind of get closer to

867
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,598
what I'm thought but today the naked

868
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,200
barley there's so there's two types of

869
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,960
baries um that I want to be able to

870
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,199
distinguish really clearly so what we

871
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,119
usually use for to see out on the fields

872
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:14,519
and use for making M for our Brewing

873
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,160
Industries is I would say like 99%

874
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:21,358
covered barley has to H around the

875
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:24,719
grade but another opportunity that we're

876
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,838
working with a bigger USDA funded Grant

877
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,799
uh is native barley that doesn't have

878
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:32,199
the h around the rade and this enables

879
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,800
for smaller Farmers or local producers

880
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,358
to

881
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,160
um get the more high quality product out

882
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,838
of it as it needs less mechanical

883
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,318
processing that could potentially

884
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,199
eliminate some of those um nutritional

885
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:52,079
elements that we're interested

886
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:55,199
in so to I don't know has anybody seen

887
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,079
have everybody seen make Val out there

888
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,480
um this some of us here

889
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,079
so I'm not sure this laser is going to

890
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,599
work but

891
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,079
um could get that going really

892
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,039
quick um here we

893
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:17,359
go yeah so difference between the H and

894
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:19,400
half bar is all about the H right and

895
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,400
interestingly now we have witnessed

896
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,920
something in the evolution of barley

897
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,920
that has CA the single Bas peration in

898
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,039
The Barley um

899
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,920
in the gene called the new Gene

900
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:34,480
interesting or

901
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,639
not and what it has done it has provided

902
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,199
a sned part um that in a way that

903
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:44,279
eliminate kind ofical clue between the

904
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,960
rain and the H

905
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,519
itself enabling us to uh lose the H of

906
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,559
the BARC grain during the harvesting

907
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:58,280
already without the need to go through

908
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:01,799
that U polishing or the deuling process

909
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,359
that could lose um important parts like

910
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,160
The Germ and the brand of the

911
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:10,598
grain that have a lot of nutrients and

912
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:12,519
this would also make it not possible to

913
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,359
call that brain product a whole grain

914
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,838
anymore if those parts are

915
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:22,318
done um but why would anybody want to

916
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:25,078
grow part at all um yeah I just

917
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,759
mentioned easier to process and handle

918
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,280
as there's also no need for this

919
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,520
expensive Machinery that would cause uh

920
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,119
increase the expenses and lose their

921
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:39,440
nutrients in there uh and also I think

922
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,838
it's a it's a great potential for a

923
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,400
higher Market Val due to it health

924
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,519
benefits like increase better Co gain

925
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,000
and also those nutrients that we don't

926
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,960
lose in the

927
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,079
process uh of theing of polishing and I

928
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:58,039
think it still has a variety of uses

929
00:42:53,079 --> 00:43:00,720
that one could find um but what's Most

930
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,759
Fascinating for me is the potential to

931
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,558
diversify the crops in the region and

932
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,319
also to address the consumer demand for

933
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,359
local organic products

934
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,719
as other body products or other ways I

935
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:14,719
feel are sometimes a little more

936
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:18,118
complicated to get out to the end

937
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:21,279
product to the consumer so I think this

938
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,760
using or growing a naked

939
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,200
bodyy is a good way to simplify the

940
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,680
process of um product development from

941
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:35,118
Farm to out deparm

942
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,118
market for sh

943
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,680
store so we are a part of actually this

944
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,920
bigger

945
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:46,960
uh PR funded by USDA organic research

946
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,559
and uh extension initiative it's called

947
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,079
multi-use navy party for organic

948
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,800
systems in there we have five different

949
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,440
universities uh all across the US and

950
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,920
also some Regional um

951
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,318
people uh they help us uh to get the

952
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,119
knowledge out to the farmers and people

953
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:06,279
in the

954
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,960
public um as an example we have

955
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,400
Goldenwood Center for region of wood and

956
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,679
farming here in New

957
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,119
York um and this is all crew uh that we

958
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:20,519
had a meet up uh last

959
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:23,160
year um so what is this project about

960
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,119
it's uh it's a multi-year project and

961
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,679
it's covering a lot of goals actually to

962
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:33,358
be honest uh so

963
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:34,919
like I listed them all out here but uh

964
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,358
to explain them more detail I don't have

965
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,440
that much time

966
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:41,880
but everybody can read them out there

967
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,838
but overall what I want to get out from

968
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,480
here is to show

969
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,318
how to show our like multifaceted

970
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,838
approach to

971
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:54,000
um to doing soever things the same time

972
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,318
we're trying to breed new NE party

973
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,480
varieties for

974
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,440
Farmers that are adapted to local

975
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,240
growing conditions we want to test

976
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,119
varities that are already out there and

977
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,000
at the same time we want to increase

978
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,119
this knowledge out there that the public

979
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,519
would know more about naked party and

980
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,160
its benefits and also the consumers and

981
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:16,800
farmers and everybody that we come into

982
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:18,759
contact with that so to conclude I could

983
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,359
kind of squeeze all those goals into

984
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,359
those three points that I just mentioned

985
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:27,960
yeah I think find the VAR we could grow

986
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:30,440
now fine tuning the bi genetics to um

987
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,400
generate new variation that's even

988
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,639
better um and educating Pharm and wi

989
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,280
public about

990
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,279
benefits um so we have actually had

991
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,359
those organic nak prodct trials going on

992
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,519
in uh Etha for a few years we've been

993
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:49,598
tting witer and spring uh varieties out

994
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:53,280
there and here I have just kind of

995
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,720
written out a couple of things I noticed

996
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,559
um performance of winter body has been

997
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,199
really good um

998
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,960
no big issues with Winter survival and

999
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,558
what's been fascinating for me is that

1000
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,039
we haven't seen very

1001
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,960
significant uh differences in the yield

1002
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,960
but menual multi party varieties or the

1003
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,960
varieties in the organic environments in

1004
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,519
that are

1005
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,800
naked um and I got to mention that we

1006
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,079
see like a small e plus but I think

1007
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,839
that's mostly coming because the grains

1008
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,000
that we har don't have the hall

1009
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:32,880
so the H already weigh some things so we

1010
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,440
can't really think of that as marketable

1011
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,079
yeah uh we also spring varieties don't

1012
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,280
have had some issues with drought and

1013
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,318
some dry rear but overall also been

1014
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,160
performing well level in in the fing

1015
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,239
Lakes

1016
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:51,519
Region and um we've also had a lot of

1017
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,318
focus on trying to quantify the

1018
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,400
resistance for different trades that we

1019
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:57,679
have flying around

1020
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,760
here like

1021
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:05,199
headl smart and uh also trying to keep

1022
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,599
tabs on the D accumulation on the grains

1023
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:11,558
make sure it's marketable in the food

1024
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:14,318
industry and what else have we noticed

1025
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:17,839
about those trials is even the better

1026
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:20,318
flood gain levels in NE body are high

1027
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:25,119
which is really good for people's

1028
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:28,920
digestion it can complicate using n Ming

1029
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,838
uh processes which is important here in

1030
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,800
in the

1031
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:36,199
region and also that we are not having

1032
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,760
too many problems with um the reg man

1033
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:41,358
management that are I feel like most of

1034
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,280
our problems are SOL originating from

1035
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:46,318
different bacteria and funguses that

1036
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,319
live out there and want to share the

1037
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,159
crop with

1038
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:53,079
us

1039
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,558
um and yeah due to that we have kind

1040
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,039
of developed PR strategy all those other

1041
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:03,000
univers together to

1042
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,480
um to found this breeding population by

1043
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,679
crossing different already covered lines

1044
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,280
and non-covered lines uh in terms of

1045
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,279
just getting those good trades over from

1046
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,440
those varieties that have

1047
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,079
for like as an example for M party or

1048
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,159
for like high for longer because

1049
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,240
interestingly enough those what I need

1050
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,199
to mention is that those covered and

1051
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,919
non-covered parties have been relatively

1052
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,519
segregated

1053
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:33,800
for a long time as you know that they

1054
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:37,000
used to be one before this mute mutation

1055
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,359
happened but I guess now they haven't

1056
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,639
been crossed to each

1057
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:44,318
other too much so they do have a lot of

1058
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:48,519
different genetic backgrounds that we

1059
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:51,679
can uh exploit by uh Crossing them with

1060
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:54,838
each other and seeing what could help us

1061
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,798
sound um so yeah the main things we're

1062
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,639
doing with netive party in Cornell is

1063
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:02,239
growing out different populations within

1064
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:06,400
this project we're growing out diversity

1065
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:09,199
population to see is there any exotic or

1066
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,079
interesting trait that we could map down

1067
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,078
genetically and exploit that in a

1068
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,480
reading

1069
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,798
program we're also growing out the bring

1070
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,280
population where we're constantly

1071
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:22,480
generating the new variation and

1072
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,920
selecting on that and the third feel

1073
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,000
that we're growing up in Cornell has

1074
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,119
been those Regional trials where we test

1075
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,639
are best spring and fall lines uh all

1076
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,920
across those locations in us so Oregon

1077
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:38,400
Minnesota Wisconsin and also stes

1078
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,838
California and our main focus here has

1079
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,720
been on the traes that are important for

1080
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:46,558
the varieties to grow in New York which

1081
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:49,358
for those lines is winter Survival reab

1082
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,160
spting Resistance Dr resistance for

1083
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:55,000
Springs disease resistance and also we

1084
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:59,440
competitive ability that a former

1085
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,880
graduation carzi used to do some science

1086
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,798
on so here what I want to show is just

1087
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,599
the

1088
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:07,679
overall uh pipeline that we have been

1089
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,240
sending those varieties to over the

1090
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,919
years

1091
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,838
um and since we are in the second cycle

1092
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,680
of this project we already have those

1093
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:20,880
lines that we crossed a few years ago at

1094
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:24,480
this point we already have preliminar

1095
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,838
trials um that we can make better

1096
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,880
selections um or ready for some

1097
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,078
potential line candidates and place them

1098
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,318
across them across the United

1099
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:39,000
States um so here I'm just pointing out

1100
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:43,400
some of the why is it so important to

1101
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,599
test those traits here locally as we see

1102
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,798
we might face relatively different

1103
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,440
conditions as one we faed in Minnesota

1104
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:52,239
or

1105
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,838
Davies so here are just some examples

1106
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,838
what I've witnessed in my fields in

1107
00:50:53,838 --> 00:51:00,159
terms of winter kill uh in terms of

1108
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,279
adapt to the different environmental

1109
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:05,279
conditions when sometimes get 70° and

1110
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,000
then it gets cold again and just that's

1111
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,200
what we're doing out there is testing

1112
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,960
which of those BV which do not and here

1113
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,199
on the picture on the right you see some

1114
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,240
of the theees that are kind of climbing

1115
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:19,759
up those leaves in the summer that hiden

1116
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,479
if you look at the crop on the top but

1117
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,240
as soon as you look into the can of be

1118
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,358
there's a whole life going down there on

1119
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:29,439
those leaves um that we're still trying

1120
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:33,880
to

1121
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:37,000
quantify um so my research mostly in

1122
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,640
with nak prob is focused on

1123
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,920
uh on the prab spring resistance and

1124
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,078
just to quickly Define What is pre

1125
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,639
sprouting uh pre sprouting is something

1126
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:51,079
that happens with those SP rains on the

1127
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:53,400
field as the moisture increases they

1128
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:55,839
they might gerate that on the field uh

1129
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,280
depending on their genetic background

1130
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:01,558
which has been maging

1131
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:05,640
in in South Central New York in July

1132
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:08,440
when the rains are hitting us hard and

1133
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:11,279
so one thing is if it happens on the

1134
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:14,559
field we cannot really measure that

1135
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,680
every year so we have developed a a

1136
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,280
method to measure that inside a

1137
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,399
greenhouse with an artificial missing

1138
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,040
array where you just Harvest five spikes

1139
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,838
from every genetic line try them out

1140
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,318
three days and put them into the missing

1141
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:34,279
chamber for 3 days and kind of exposing

1142
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:36,519
those lines to those humid conditions to

1143
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,960
get this score of susceptibility to the

1144
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:41,759
SP spring and here as an example we see

1145
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,000
it's going of a 9

1146
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,520
score where here we see how those most

1147
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,318
distance lines don't have any spring in

1148
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,400
any of those brains after three days of

1149
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:56,159
being completely p

1150
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,000
on as when some of the lines have gentic

1151
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:01,598
background that just have almost every

1152
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,159
grin in Germany and when this happens

1153
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,960
doesn't matter if it's naked barley or

1154
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:09,199
just the modeling barley or any B part

1155
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:13,358
this is something that no far reveal

1156
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:16,960
that that would just mean a complete L

1157
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:19,598
um so but luckily for us we have been

1158
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,480
able to really uh narrow into the

1159
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,960
genetics of this trait completely and

1160
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,119
here I'm just showing some work from our

1161
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,079
previous student uh that Swede who

1162
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:34,160
figured out specific base bears with

1163
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,400
couple V students that are causing those

1164
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:39,279
um there go in this variation I just

1165
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,960
showed on the last picture so you see

1166
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,760
that if the body line has at this

1167
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,720
specific location so part has a Rel big

1168
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:53,640
genome millions of Base PA but if this

1169
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:58,159
specific one Base PA has a and g

1170
00:53:53,639 --> 00:54:01,798
there it does have um almost the highest

1171
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:05,399
uh like as an example number seven

1172
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:10,280
score as this NN is like super n dormant

1173
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,358
one but if the body line would have no A

1174
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,440
and G there and the T there meaning it's

1175
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:19,838
the the most super dorant

1176
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:24,200
one we see a relatively massive

1177
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:25,880
difference between the spr SC um and

1178
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:28,639
this is something that so these are

1179
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,798
actually two genes here and so these are

1180
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:34,639
the different specific base pairs that

1181
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:37,000
are in there and just by measuring this

1182
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,279
in the lab or sending it out and having

1183
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,838
somebody else measure this in the lab we

1184
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,920
could already just even without testing

1185
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,440
those lights out LS out on the field we

1186
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,079
could already see which one has the

1187
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,119
trait that we are trying to select for

1188
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,880
and which one

1189
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,160
doesn't um so this is what I'm doing

1190
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,280
right now I'm growing those populations

1191
00:54:54,159 --> 00:55:00,960
out with the naked body so then we work

1192
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,880
that out in the covered party background

1193
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,720
and my Approach right now is to take

1194
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,440
this into the naked bodyy background and

1195
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,798
um just to prove that this is also

1196
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,920
working in this background and uh we

1197
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,880
could also have naked body lines that

1198
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,720
are suitable for New York and that would

1199
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,760
not sprout in the middle of July when it

1200
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:24,159
rain too

1201
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:29,079
much um and this is where I want to

1202
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:31,798
conclude um my presentation um if

1203
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:34,920
anybody has any more questions about

1204
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:38,000
naked barlier or where to get the seed

1205
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,639
if somebody's interested uh come ask me

1206
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,480
or Jun Russell right here in the crowd I

1207
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:45,440
think she could also help people out and

1208
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,358
yeah I'm just taking a chance to thank

1209
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,798
everybody that has been helping me out

1210
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:53,078
for grass and Carl funy our small great

1211
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,679
lab who's also right here D bener

1212
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,240
Priscilla Thompson and uh Jason Schiller

1213
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,199
that have big help for us and also all

1214
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,959
those collaborators from different

1215
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:04,919
universities and if you have more

1216
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,639
questions or you just want to check out

1217
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,240
our websites uh here's the one for that

1218
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,519
tells more info about the N party

1219
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,318
project and this is just more info about

1220
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,358
our small grain project uh at PR

1221
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:19,400
University so that's all for me and

1222
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:23,400
thank

1223
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,400
you questions

1224
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:28,339
[Music]

1225
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,280
so

1226
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,610
[Music]

1227
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,720
also Health has been um in a bigger

1228
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,760
picture related to that increased better

1229
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:54,318
clu gain that

1230
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:57,000
um is related with the digestive system

1231
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,400
um and I think it it provides those more

1232
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,639
complicated carbohydrates that are in

1233
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,920
terms of rting like how to say

1234
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:10,598
um that improve the

1235
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:12,119
microbiome um in the gut and yeah just

1236
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:17,880
make the

1237
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:19,920
system in how to say more stable yeah

1238
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,160
I'm another medical researcher so can

1239
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,400
quote me on that but yeah that's as far

1240
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,399
as I

1241
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,160
know yeah
