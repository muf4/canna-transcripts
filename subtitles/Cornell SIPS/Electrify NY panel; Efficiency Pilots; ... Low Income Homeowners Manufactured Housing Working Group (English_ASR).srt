1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,839
University um hi everyone I'm Danielle

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,679
Eisman and I work here at Cornell in the

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,240
public health program but outside of my

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,560
normal day job I also lead a working

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:25,000
group that focuses on manufactured

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:28,000
housing issues um among many of those

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,480
issues is the aspect of Energy

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,238
Efficiency so that is what I'm here to

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,799
talk to you all a little bit about

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,839
today um so just for a little bit of

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,479
context manufactured homes um nationally

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
they are the largest source of

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,279
unsubsidized affordable housing um which

15
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,640
is something that we often forget

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,840
there's also roughly across the United

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,799
States 22 million people that live in

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,079
manufactured homes um some of you may be

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,358
more familiar with the term mobile homes

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,518
but usually these homes although they

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,198
are often built in a factory and

22
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:07,679
transported once they are installed and

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,039
put in place they rarely ever move again

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,759
so the term of mobile home is is no

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,759
longer uh accurate so we now use the

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:19,640
term manufactured homes um and according

27
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,599
to New York State executive law

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,319
616 manufactured homes are defined as

29
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,399
single family dwellings um and they are

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,559
supposed to be allowed in residential

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,600
districts um the state leaves it up to

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,640
individual municipalities in terms of

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,359
the Zoning for manufactured homes and uh

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,519
once you start digging down into some of

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,799
the zoning policies they don't outright

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,199
ban manufactured homes in Municipal

37
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,360
districts um but some of the language

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,879
around it uh prevents the installation

39
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,640
of some of these homes and although they

40
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,920
are not um always perceived to be the

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,118
most desirable form of affordable

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,039
housing the the changes that we've seen

43
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:08,840
in the development of manufactured homes

44
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,840
has really um allowed homes that are

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,560
built in factories and then transported

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,959
to be a very affordable energy efficient

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,560
um environmentally friendly form of

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,519
providing housing options for folks and

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,598
we all know in New York state affordable

50
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,840
housing is uh part of a crisis that

51
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,759
we're experiencing nationally um but

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,640
also in New York state

53
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,799
um so again for a little bit more

54
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,439
context um in New York state there's

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,360
just under 200,000 manufactured homes um

56
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,400
that makes up 2.4% of the state's total

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,760
housing stock um in rural areas that

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,080
percentage increases up to over 10% um

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,000
here in Tomkins County we're at roughly

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,120
6% for the number of manufactured homes

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,959
um that make up the housing stock um

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,439
roughly a third of them are are in

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,799
manufactured housing communities or what

64
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,519
we used to call mobile home parks um and

65
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,920
New York state has roughly 1,800 of

66
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,480
these 48 of its um 60 in 48 of its 62

67
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,518
counties and we can see that uh Saratoga

68
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,359
Duchess and olster Counties have the

69
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,920
highest concentration of manufactured

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,959
housing communities as well as

71
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,878
manufactured homes um although as I've

72
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,759
encountered with many of my students

73
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,479
very few people actually notice them um

74
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,598
so I don't know if anybody has driven

75
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,119
past a few of the communities just

76
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,919
outside of Ithaca um but they're they're

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,120
frequently ignored um and what we've

78
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,479
come to learn through my manufactured

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,480
housing working group is that the people

80
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:55,359
living in manufactured homes are just

81
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,158
filled with infinite need Energy

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Efficiency is one of the topper our top

83
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:04,078
priorities in terms of the amount of

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,239
needs that homes or people residents

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,079
living in these homes need or have um

86
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,799
but just to give you a sense of the

87
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:16,079
energy burden by housing type um other

88
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,759
than a a boat or RV van mobile homes uh

89
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,439
manufactured homes are among the highest

90
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:26,479
in terms of energy burden um and energy

91
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:28,519
burden is referred to as or it means the

92
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,560
percentage of income that people are

93
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:36,240
spending on their energy um and we see

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,199
that you know one unit um or multi-units

95
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,319
tend to be a little bit more efficient

96
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,800
when it comes to energy usage and energy

97
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,879
consumption so it's a little bit more

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,918
affordable but um a lot of folks prefer

99
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,360
to have their own space right some

100
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,719
people um are quite accustomed to living

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,038
in the city and being you know sharing

102
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,320
walls with people um but a lot of people

103
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,199
still want their own four walls they

104
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,599
don't want to be living in apartment

105
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
buildings and so manufactured homes have

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
been able to offer that option to them

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,720
but as you can see it comes with higher

108
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,279
costs right um people are spending a lot

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,440
more of their income on energy when

110
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,119
they're living in a manufactured home

111
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,439
compared to a siteb built

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,319
home um to give you a sense of what

113
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,879
that's like here in Tomkins County where

114
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:32,199
I've been focusing most of my work um we

115
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,719
have roughly 11% of our housing stock um

116
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,520
that is for people living in

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,840
manufactured homes um 177% of our

118
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,318
existing housing stock in terms of

119
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,000
manufactured homes were built before

120
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,919
1976 and that's important because in

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,399
1976 HUD started to change the rules in

122
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,120
terms of Energy Efficiency for

123
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,959
manufactured homes um so to have you

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,840
know these 177% of those homes that are

125
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:04,560
19 from 1976 or before it means they're

126
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:07,239
probably in the worst shape in terms of

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,478
how efficient they are with energy

128
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,960
they're also poorly insulated and if

129
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,318
they haven't been wellmaintained then a

130
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,399
lot of those people are highly

131
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,720
vulnerable to extreme temperatures

132
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:22,159
whether it's extreme cold or extreme

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,720
heat um in additional 26% of the

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,759
manufactured homes in Tomkins County

135
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,160
were built um before 1990 so between

136
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,080
1976 and 1990

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,439
um and again HUD increased the Energy

138
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,758
Efficiency standards for manufactured

139
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,319
homes in

140
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,840
1995 um making slight improvements in

141
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,560
terms of how comfortable and how energy

142
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,758
efficient those homes were but if we

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,439
still compare them to siteb Built Homes

144
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,840
or regular um construction homes as you

145
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,120
saw in that previous graph um there's

146
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,519
still a lot of work to be done in terms

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,079
of ensuring people are are safe and

148
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,799
comfortable and able to uh keep

149
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,120
themselves alive when it's extremely

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,439
cold out or extremely hot out um an

151
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,918
additional factor to consider is that um

152
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,319
private investment companies are

153
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,399
starting to buy up manufactured housing

154
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,598
communities which are perceived to be

155
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,758
cash CS so we see these uh Property

156
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,598
Management investment companies buying

157
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,038
up communities um as an easy form of

158
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,959
investment they put very little

159
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,639
investment back into the community but

160
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,638
they end up raising rents for residents

161
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,800
living in those communities um and how

162
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,918
it often works is people either rent the

163
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,240
unit as well as the the land underneath

164
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,918
it or they rent the land and the slab

165
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,598
underneath the home and then they own

166
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:55,120
the home um and so that can present some

167
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:58,680
barriers if you're trying to introduce

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,158
Energy Efficiency um measures or

169
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,560
programs for residents in

170
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:07,598
manufactured um housing communities um

171
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,319
and what we have seen in our own County

172
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,120
we've seen it across other counties in

173
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,598
New York state is that more and more of

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,560
these communities are bought up by these

175
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,120
private investors currently in our

176
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,120
County um only 12 are still privately

177
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,079
owned by either a resident owner or um a

178
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,079
local owner one is owned by a nonprofit

179
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,240
and then the rest are owned by private

180
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,718
investor ERS and what we see is that

181
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,158
people are usually worse off in those

182
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,159
types of

183
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,559
situations and to give you a sense of

184
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,879
energy costs right um and this data was

185
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,159
it's a couple years old I think the

186
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,480
prices have changed slightly in terms of

187
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:52,360
the cost for using energy but um online

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,759
estimates suggests that um a large

189
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,600
manufactured home would use roughly 670

190
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,838
gallons of propane per year um and and

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,159
that if it's still at 325 a gallon um

192
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,320
that's roughly a little over $2,000 a

193
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,480
year um we've seen some projects locally

194
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,399
and I'll talk about that next um that

195
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,159
replacing this heating load with air

196
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,600
source heat pumps has reduced that

197
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:21,799
significantly to just under ,000 per

198
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,360
year for energy costs um and that you

199
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,879
know you get over 55% savings as well as

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,360
the reduction in carbon dioxide

201
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,360
emissions or carbon equip

202
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,440
thankfully um there's a lot of money

203
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,759
available to support these types of

204
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,360
efforts such as installing heat pumps in

205
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,039
manufactured homes um as well as

206
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,159
replacement so you recall I talked about

207
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,360
how some of these homes especially in

208
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,159
our County are older than when the

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,120
Energy Efficiency standards had changed

210
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,159
so 1976 as well as

211
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,679
1990 um

212
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,879
and so there's a lot of programs out

213
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,000
there to support the replacement of

214
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,838
these older less efficient homes um New

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,120
York state has its own um replacement

216
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,600
funds available but the application

217
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,759
process is somewhat difficult uh to

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,000
navigate especially for

219
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,958
individuals um in many cases the county

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,919
or municipality has to be able to apply

221
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,958
for these funds but there is a lot of

222
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,719
effort put out there for funding the

223
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,919
improve Improvement of manufactured

224
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,320
homes and this is just a small sampling

225
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:39,240
of the programs that are available to

226
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,839
help support and fund improved Energy

227
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,879
Efficiency projects so the USDA Rural

228
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,160
Development um section 502 Direct Loan

229
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,679
program will provide loans for the

230
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:54,000
replacement or the purchase of a new

231
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:57,239
energy efficient uh manufactured home

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,720
the IRA or infl inflation reduction act

233
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,720
will give $5,000 credit to new energy

234
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,639
efficient homes um and that also

235
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,240
includes Zero Energy modular homes or ZM

236
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:15,159
which are probably the most aggressive

237
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,720
in terms of Energy Efficiency and um low

238
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:20,278
uh low carbon emissions associated with

239
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,360
the use and the um placement of those

240
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,078
homes we also have HUD um which has been

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,560
providing Community Development block

242
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,679
grants um as well as loan guarantee

243
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,879
programs voice neighborhood grants home

244
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,199
program preservation and reinvestment

245
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,799
initiatives or the price program all

246
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
that are focused on the replacement or

247
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,078
Improvement or weatherization of

248
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,240
manufactured homes there's also the

249
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,519
department of energy weatherization

250
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,639
assistance program and sustainable

251
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,759
energy for consumers award which again

252
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,120
supports um and allows for these

253
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,439
improvements that you would apply to a

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,720
traditional siteb built home but can be

255
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,839
applied to a manufactured home um

256
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,759
there's also the EPA solar for solar for

257
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,880
all and the thriving communities funds

258
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,319
um in New York State this is available

259
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,519
via forom University so if anybody's

260
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
familiar with forom University and the

261
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,159
flourishing communities grants there's

262
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,000
three levels of grant funding available

263
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,919
for different types of projects aimed at

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,839
resilience and Energy Efficiency um and

265
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,319
they take a pretty wide scope with what

266
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,639
they're um willing to fund so it's it's

267
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,240
worth checking out two minutes okay I'm

268
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,759
going to skip all of those funding

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
projects and get to what I was supposed

270
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,480
to really focus on which is some of the

271
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,078
local Pilots um

272
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,920
so uh an organization that we have

273
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,919
locally called Ithaca Neighborhood

274
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:51,719
Housing Services received uh just under

275
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,319
$6 million from the state last year to

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,000
support infrastructure development for

277
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
the compass manufactured housing

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,159
community which is located in

279
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,039
Trumansburg just outside of ith

280
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,519
um the sustainable Finger Lakes Mobile

281
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,519
Home pilot project um heat pump pilot

282
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,519
program provided lowcost Heating and

283
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,078
Cooling options for manufactured housing

284
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,159
residents that qualified um the program

285
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,439
is wrapping up and unfortunately they

286
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,039
aren't going to be keeping that program

287
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
going because they weren't able to

288
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,319
secure additional funding but so far

289
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:29,720
they've been able to provide energy

290
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:33,000
audits um and installations of um coal

291
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,720
air air air heat Source pumps can't

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,559
remember all the acronyms um and one

293
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,560
example of that is where a woman um in

294
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:44,559
the summertime her bedroom was 108

295
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:47,919
degrees at night throughout the day

296
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,399
which is not healthy or safe for anybody

297
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:53,278
and because of this uh heat pump pilot

298
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,480
program her bedroom is now very

299
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,360
comfortable no matter how hot it is

300
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,199
outside we also have the town of dren

301
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,159
which is again nearby um they have been

302
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,000
doing some door knocking and handing out

303
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,519
information on weatherization programs

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,240
they are partnering with Empower to try

305
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,198
and help those residents with improving

306
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,198
the Energy Efficiency in their homes um

307
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,120
and then my group The manufactured

308
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,919
housing working group we are just an

309
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,000
informal group of local residents um

310
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,120
that are really trying to make a

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,480
difference in this

312
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,399
space um and then just a a couple of

313
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,759
examples I will be tabling tomorrow at

314
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,600
the energy Expo as well and I will have

315
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,000
a sample window insert um this is a

316
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,240
program based in Vermont um that

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,759
provides these lowcost window inserts

318
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,879
and you can see it makes quite a

319
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:50,399
difference for the comfort inside the

320
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,679
home so this is when it was 29 degrees

321
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,000
outside um a room without the window

322
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:59,679
insert was 47° inside and without the

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,360
window insert was 70° outside or sorry

324
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,879
70 degrees inside and then another

325
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,120
project we're trying to develop is to

326
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,600
build resilience hubs for manufactured

327
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,839
manufactured housing communities because

328
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,120
residents in these spaces often lose

329
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,519
power first and for the longest amount

330
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,519
of time um which puts them at a high

331
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,560
risk um whether or not they're

332
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,039
experiencing extreme temperatures or
