00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
all right well thank you for coming

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
today my first

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,439
reaction when i was getting ready was

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,839
what a dorky title for a presentation

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,839
i have to tell you where it came about

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,480
it was a week in january

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,439
my father-in-law passed away my

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
mother-in-law

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,278
was failing in health and we needed to

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,839
move her

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,079
into an assisted living facility and i

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
got an email from neil saying i need a

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
seminar title

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,920
and that sounded like a good idea at the

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
time not having any idea where i was

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
going to go with it but

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
i think at this point i have a little

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
bit of a better sense

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,280
so a little bit about myself again i'm

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,840
marcia iam shively and i have this

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,640
unusual split in our department

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
i'm actually 50 teaching as a senior

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
lecturer

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
and 50 extension as a senior extension

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
associate

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,679
and i know that as a non-tenure track

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
faculty member i i see this as a dreamy

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
split because it's all education

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,920
you know it would be viewed as tough to

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,118
get tenure on but i'm really grateful

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,359
for it because

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,478
it does afford me the opportunity to

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,000
really wallow

36
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,118
in education and um in in a

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,879
presentation like this when i look back

38
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,959
over the last five years

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,920
it's always a little tricky to know

40
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,478
whether to go

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,439
for breadth or depth you know should i

42
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,400
be giving you

43
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,000
a sort of dog and pony show sort of so

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,359
to speak of everything i've done for the

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
last five years

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,599
if i were in your shoes i don't think

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
i'd find it that interesting

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,599
or go for a little bit more depth so i'm

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,879
actually going to try to shoot for both

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,359
today

51
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,519
so what i'm going to do is in four

52
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,000
slides i'm going to do

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,798
sort of highlights of the last five

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
years

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,439
four dense text heavy slides

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
and i won't linger on them so that i can

57
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,078
then go

58
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,959
more deeply into something that i find

59
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,120
interesting and hope you will as well

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,959
so bear with me while i do a quick

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,959
overview because i do think it's

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,039
important that you have a sense of

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
how have i spent my time in the last

64
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,000
five years so i'm just going to do some

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
highlights

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,159
and then walk away from those if any of

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,239
these intrigue you you can make a note

68
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,000
of it and just ask me about it at the

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,800
end of the presentation

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,199
so i'm first teaching highlights i do

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
suite of distance learning courses

174
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,119
two times a year i teach a suite of

175
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,359
three

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,478
botanical illustration courses and an

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
introduction

178
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,519
to garden design so i you know i know

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
that's just

180
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,799
a lot but i feel it's necessary to tell

181
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
you about

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
i'm not going to go into that in any

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,918
detail if you're interested

184
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,758
please ask me about it so now a little

185
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,758
bit more of the depth

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,038
whatever the context whether i'm

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,720
involved in teaching or extension

188
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,079
these are the things that are the most

189
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
important to me

190
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,318
i had a wonderful opportunity so to

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,960
speak about four years ago i had my

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,439
first really awful semester

193
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,879
it was a really awful semester and and

194
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,399
it gave me the chance to

195
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,319
try to think about why is it so bad

196
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,918
why am i not getting through in this

197
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
class what is it that i haven't

198
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,399
articulated that's important to me

199
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,719
so i spent a whole semester thinking

200
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,399
what have i not conveyed

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
that is really important to me and how

202
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,519
could i do a better job of

203
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,439
that and at the end of the semester

204
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,918
here's what i had come up with

205
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,639
deep learning genuine participation and

206
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,918
engagement

207
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,038
reflection community civility

208
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,639
and respect and creativity these are

209
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,038
really important to me

210
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
you'll find them all in my rubrics it's

211
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,800
very clear to my student that these my

212
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,598
students that these are important to me

213
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
too

214
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,120
i measure it i look for it remind people

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,319
of it

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,399
i can stand behind it and so

217
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,960
it was an awful semester and it was

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,878
really a wonderful semester

219
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,878
i'm not going to talk about any of those

220
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
above five for the remainder of the

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,160
presentation

222
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,199
i'd like to talk about creativity

223
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
because i spend

224
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,240
so much of my life wallowing in it

225
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
that i i think it's important that you

226
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
all as my colleagues

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,560
understand why that matters

228
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,799
why do we have somebody in our

229
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,759
department who is explicitly

230
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
looking at this particular thing and i'd

231
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
like to begin

232
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
uh with with some definitions for your

233
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,638
benefit

234
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,758
what is it to be creative according to

235
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,840
the dictionary

236
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
it is relating to or involving the

237
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,279
imagination

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,478
or original ideas so that's what it is

239
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,759
to be creative

240
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
and creativity is the ability to

241
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,439
transcend

242
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,359
traditional ideas rules patterns

243
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,640
relationships and the like

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
to create meaningful new ideas forms

245
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,679
methods interpretations

246
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,120
so it's originality progressiveness

247
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,120
or imagination so this is what creative

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,080
and creativity is

249
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,278
transcending traditional ideas original

250
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
ideas

251
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,519
so before we go any further and i love

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
this painting you can't really

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,480
appreciate it in this light i did this

254
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,519
in january and

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,519
on my screen it's gorgeous

256
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,799
i'd love to just sort of spend some time

257
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,440
looking at this i should have brought

258
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
into the

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,680
the original but i would have gotten off

260
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,719
track with that

261
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,719
um but i'd like to have an awkward pause

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,759
and i'm going to pause for just a moment

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,480
and ask you this question

264
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,278
think about your work as a researcher a

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,800
teacher

266
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:33,600
an extension specialist a student

267
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,958
how are you creative within the context

268
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
of your work

269
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,319
and what does it mean to you to be

270
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,319
creative certainly

271
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
every one of us in this room is not the

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
purview of artists

273
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
if we're not creative we're probably not

274
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,039
here at cornell university because it is

275
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,000
about

276
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,000
original ideas new thinking so just

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,839
pause for a moment and think about that

278
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,159
you may even want to write a note to

279
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
self

280
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,600
just you know think about any facet of

281
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
your work

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
and while you're thinking about that you

283
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,159
might also think what if anything

284
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:12,958
blocks that ability to think or act

285
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,958
creatively

286
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,239
so again just kind of hold that thought

287
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,879
i'm going to come back to these

288
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,799
questions i'll give you an opportunity

289
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,480
to tell me a little bit about it but

290
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,479
just hold that thought for now

291
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,360
so the way the rest of this presentation

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
is structured first i want to tell you

293
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
the what

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,039
of what i work on in this arena so i'm

295
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
spending a lot of time with it

296
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,799
and then i want to come back to that

297
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,278
question of you know why

298
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,278
maybe why it matters to you then i'll

299
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,480
share with you why it matters to me

300
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,519
and to my audience so first the what

301
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,039
over the past five years i put a lot of

302
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,639
energy into

303
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,719
kind of the arts based part of

304
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,958
horticulture we have a big

305
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
online curriculum called dig art

306
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,879
creating cultivating create creativity

307
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
in the garden

308
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,278
it's a it's a it's an avenue through to

309
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
ecological stewardship

310
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:13,360
through the creative arts

311
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,519
in the garden also i mentioned the art

312
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
of horticulture course i'm spending a

313
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,440
lot of time

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,480
guiding students in the creative process

315
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,839
in horticulture producing all sorts of

316
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,879
novel work

317
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,040
and this is our dean sitting with our

318
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,958
students out in front of the

319
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,240
when we had the sod sofa in front of

320
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,879
caldwell hall

321
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,278
so we do a lot in this area a lot of a

322
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,720
lot of

323
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,559
activity and energy we have this new

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
horticulture minor with a focus on the

325
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,319
botanical arts

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,799
and students are already enrolling i

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,959
have seven students signed up and i just

328
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,639
you know just launched it in the fall

329
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,479
and i'm pleased with that as a good

330
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
start because some of them

331
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
i had a ton of seniors who wanted to do

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
it but they just

333
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,519
you know they couldn't meet the

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,159
requirements for the minor

335
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,480
and then this distance these distance

336
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,278
courses that i teach to students all

337
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,879
over the world

338
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,559
i'm telling you if there's one thing i

339
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,278
can do that i can

340
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,599
stand behind and say that i do well man

341
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,159
i

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
tell you what i can teach people to draw

343
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,360
and paint

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,399
and work online i feel very confident

345
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,720
about that

346
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
most times that i teach it i have

347
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,600
students that surpass

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,679
me this is john perry's drawing and

349
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,159
graphite of a mountain laurel it took

350
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,078
him 20 hours and i look at that and say

351
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,679
i could not i don't think i could do

352
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,879
that at this point

353
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,679
so students work their way through

354
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,240
a series of courses that take them ever

355
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,519
deeper

356
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,720
into proficiency and technical skill

357
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,200
as well as the ability to portray plants

358
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
beautifully and creatively and i'm

359
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
astonished

360
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
at what they're able to produce and i'm

361
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,159
not kidding you

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,278
i just wrapped up a unit this weekend of

363
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,838
three courses

364
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,399
and i have a lot of students who are who

365
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,320
are now a lot better than i am which

366
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,799
is a really interesting feeling and then

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
and then um there is the work that just

368
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,439
sort of

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
you know it bridges teaching and

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,279
extension and everything i think a good

371
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
example is patrick doherty we brought

372
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,838
him here as a messenger lecturer

373
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,000
i collaborated with larry smart which

374
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
was so exciting we brought all this

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
willow into the i think a children's

376
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,278
garden we had a hundred people

377
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
working with this world-renowned

378
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,958
sculptor to produce this

379
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,839
just amazing piece of sculpture and it

380
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,679
this is like nearly chaos here's patrick

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
doherty right at the center of it

382
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,039
center of it girl scouts are running all

383
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,919
over the place man it was so much fun

384
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,919
so well i'm putting a lot of energy into

385
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,240
this arena you know it's taking a good

386
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,519
chunk of my time and i think it is

387
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
it's important to um to ask the question

388
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,600
why does it matter

389
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,799
i mean why does this matter why

390
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,959
should we be having in this department

391
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,240
someone who's putting energy into arts

392
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,838
based coursework and

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,839
and effort and and reflect on that and

394
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,519
be transparent about it i have

395
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,360
my thoughts about it but i'd love to

396
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,198
hear from you

397
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,278
maybe we even begin with the second

398
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,519
question how did you answer that earlier

399
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,559
question what is it to be creative

400
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,240
what blocks your creativity and why do

401
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,759
you think this work matters

402
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
and then i'm going to spend about 20

403
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,360
minutes telling you why i think it

404
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
matters so let's hear from some of you

405
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,440
i really can wait a long time

406
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,879
as my students know if i pause i'm

407
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
really waiting for somebody else to

408
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,838
speak yes

409
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,119
and there was that word opportunity so

410
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,120
it means taking an opportunity

411
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,120
to you know you're talking about

412
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
somewhat traditional arts approaches in

413
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,759
terms of creative performance or

414
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,519
but it could be research what is it to

415
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,078
be creative in your research

416
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
i'd love to hear somebody address that

417
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,078
yes

418
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,480
to be able to think outside the box and

419
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,000
answer these questions that

420
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
are the gaps in the research and so

421
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,320
sometimes that involves completely novel

422
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,518
thinking and designing

423
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,480
an approach that's never been done but

424
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
you know then you also have the it

425
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,680
blocks your creativity because you have

426
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,958
to follow what's been done before and it

427
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,519
has to be publishable

428
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,879
and so you have to you can be creative

429
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,879
but within those guidelines

430
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,439
to be innovative at the other hand

431
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,359
you've got some constraints

432
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
what about those of you at geneva what

433
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,879
would you have to say about this

434
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
steve what do you think

435
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,198
um

436
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:27,198
i think for me the fun of

437
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,279
being creative is to sort of challenge

438
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,838
what people believe whether it's a

439
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,759
grower or whether it's a fellow

440
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,759
horticulturalist and

441
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,360
this is the way we do things well ask

442
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
the question why do you do it that way

443
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,759
has it been tried another way

444
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,119
i mean and then and then develop some

445
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,480
some sort of a

446
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,560
study or a test for that you know

447
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
hypothesis that we all believe in but

448
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,559
nobody really knows why or

449
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:58,240
when it started wonderful thank you

450
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:01,599
and and before oh go ahead neil

451
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,120
stephanie said sometimes we can't really

452
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,798
be so creative because we're trying to

453
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,759
set ourselves to accomplish a specific

454
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,599
objective

455
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,798
but if there's ways that we can still be

456
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,279
creative in our research

457
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,959
like we've talked about in the past an

458
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,038
undergraduate student will come to me

459
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,038
and be interested in an independent

460
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,359
research project i don't have any

461
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,798
sort of like time and money invested in

462
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,479
it so we can think of something really

463
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,639
creative and if it fails that's

464
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,759
perfectly fine and it's fun and we still

465
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
learn something

466
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
in the end and more often than not it

467
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,798
works out and turns into something

468
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,798
bigger than that in the end

469
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,720
that point about failure i think that's

470
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,159
really important

471
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,759
one more you have an element of risk

472
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,558
taking an adventure

473
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,759
and if it doesn't then we're missing out

474
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,319
on an opportunity

475
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,359
individually as well as institutions

476
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,599
absolutely

477
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:56,639
i'm right there with you about risk too

478
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,759
in terms of why this work matters i

479
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,038
would like to tell you why i think

480
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,400
this plethora of courses and approaches

481
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,798
matters

482
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
and i think part of it is because it

483
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,839
helps open

484
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,798
up students to exactly what you're

485
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,119
talking about

486
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,319
they need practice and sometimes they

487
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
don't get that practice

488
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,558
in a traditional classroom setting so

489
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,240
these courses might what

490
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:25,279
my hope is in the next 20 minutes or so

491
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,519
that i can convince you

492
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,200
so to speak that this is more than

493
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,679
drawing a pretty picture

494
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
it's more than fun it's more than

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
something that's beautiful

496
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,039
although for me if it's beautiful alone

497
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
that you know that's that's terrific

498
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,879
but i i think here is i'll be real

499
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,880
transparent as we are

500
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,480
entering a new era of a plant science

501
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
school for example

502
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,240
i think it's even more important that

503
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,280
people understand that

504
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,839
this kind of suite of approaches it's

505
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,160
nested

506
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,439
firmly in our discipline it's not an

507
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
aside it's not an

508
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
add-on so that's how i'd like to spend

509
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,599
the rest of our time together

510
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,720
first i'd like to offer a definition of

511
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,759
horticulture

512
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,480
and just remind us that it is the art

513
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,879
and science of cultivating gardens or

514
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,880
plants depending on the

515
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
definition it's a very part of our

516
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,919
discipline it's right at the heart of it

517
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,600
it's in our definition

518
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,759
and i'm going to say a few words about

519
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,759
botanical illustration because sometimes

520
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,960
i think for people there's an

521
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,919
it's a the the botanical arts or

522
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,000
an arts focus equals uh botanical

523
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,840
illustration so it's worth mentioning

524
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,919
it's worth mentioning that it has a foot

525
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,599
that's firmly rooted in science and it

526
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,679
combines this kind of

527
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,119
analytic analytical thinking with a

528
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
conceptual approach

529
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,839
and its main purpose is to illustrate

530
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,639
and convey accurate information it's

531
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,399
it is a scientific exploration we're

532
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
depicting what we see

533
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
this is one of my paintings i actually

534
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,319
don't like to do this kind of painting

535
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
but i kind of did want to show my

536
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,119
students that i can since i'm teaching

537
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,880
it

538
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,199
i feel like that's probably a good idea

539
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,600
i tend to do work that's a little more

540
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,319
painterly and less accurate but have

541
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,678
that there to show you that i can

542
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,000
it also can show us information about

543
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
life cycles you can see them all

544
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,400
depicted in this one

545
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
illustration it can tell us about plants

546
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,320
and context

547
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,399
their habitat again it can do that

548
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,319
beautifully

549
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,320
and if you see drawing versus

550
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,038
photography some people might wonder

551
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,519
about

552
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,200
illustration in an era of photography

553
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,279
it's still really valuable

554
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,360
you see that illustration to the right

555
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,279
how it's drawing out details

556
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,798
that we want to see a little bit more

557
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,720
closely

558
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,798
and it's beautiful and i can't say

559
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
enough about that we do need beauty in

560
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,879
our lives and

561
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,079
and i think that is something worth

562
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
celebrating and not

563
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,079
pushing off to the side this is benta

564
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,558
king the late benta king's

565
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,119
work she was a botanical illustrator in

566
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,558
the

567
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,279
bailey hortonworthium and i actually use

568
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,918
her

569
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,158
her um textbook i just love the book

570
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,559
beautiful botanicals it's just

571
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
a wonderful book and it's perfect for my

572
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,960
coursework

573
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,840
um but frankly the other the what really

574
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,759
gets me excited is the more creative the

575
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,720
more thinking outside the box

576
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,038
thinking beyond a botanical illustration

577
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,519
this is turf work it's a big

578
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,558
acre more than acre sized piece of

579
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,639
artwork that

580
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,960
i produced with eight students out at

581
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
bluegrass lane designed to be viewed

582
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,519
from

583
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,759
the air as people were coming into the

584
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,639
airport and this was nothing short

585
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,440
of thrilling we got up and we had flight

586
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
time with

587
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,279
east hill flying club and were able to

588
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
one student

589
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,639
made a movie of it that's now on the web

590
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
and every time i

591
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
watch it every once in a while because i

592
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,798
find it so thrilling

593
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,200
and again collaborating with some

594
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,400
unlikely colleagues when it comes to

595
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,360
this sort of work

596
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,159
bill miller who put this whimsical

597
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,439
amazing

598
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,000
bulb labyrinth out at bluegrass lane i'm

599
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,960
was hoping he'd be here so i could tease

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,279
him about it a little bit but he's not

601
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
and you know ken mudge who really got

602
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,279
into teaching students about

603
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,679
um tree sculpture as a way to learn

604
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,038
about plant propagation or frank rossi

605
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,360
who

606
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,640
has become like the you know sod sofa

607
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,038
artist guy who

608
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,038
just really loves that as a way of

609
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,640
teaching people about horticultural

610
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,319
principles

611
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,240
why does it matter again i'm going to

612
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,678
the rest of the theme is about why this

613
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
matters

614
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,080
here at cornell university i just got an

615
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,559
email in the last three weeks

616
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,240
from it's the provost and the dean of

617
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,240
the college of architecture art and

618
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,079
planning it went to a few of us around

619
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,079
the university and it said

620
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,558
while there's a great deal of impressive

621
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,000
art related activity in various creative

622
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,480
corners of cornell

623
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
this activity has not coalesced into a

624
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,720
broad public sense

625
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
of the arts at this university this is

626
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,279
in contrast

627
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,519
to some of our peers which have

628
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,519
discovered and promoted the arts

629
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,200
as an important component of their

630
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,759
intellectual mission

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,159
it goes on to say the goal is to find a

632
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,480
collective and inclusive structure

633
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
that can serve to advance and highlight

634
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,960
the arts as a key

635
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,000
academic dimension of cornell and serve

636
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,120
more effectively

637
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,440
as a port of call for development

638
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,599
so this is really cool it's happening

639
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
right now and we're leading we're we're

640
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,319
in the

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
you know this is a part of who we are

642
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,359
and we're actually leading the charge

643
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,480
here at the university

644
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,479
which i'm absolutely thrilled about

645
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,079
if we look at that dig art curriculum

646
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,798
and we look at what's happening with our

647
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,480
extension

648
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:49,200
audiences what we're learning is that

649
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,599
arts based approaches to gardening to

650
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
the sciences speaks to a diversity of

651
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,439
learners

652
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,200
it makes learning meaningful it can

653
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,400
foster critical thinking

654
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,880
it develops reflective learners helps

655
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,798
learners to engage with important ideas

656
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
and questions

657
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,480
it creates an interdisciplinary and

658
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,719
holistic curriculum

659
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,079
helps students to question concepts and

660
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,240
make connections

661
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,359
makes learning visible this is one of my

662
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,839
favorite things

663
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,359
it can be used for program evaluation

664
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,278
assessments

665
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,278
for young children and you're trying to

666
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,319
get at what they know if you can ask

667
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,359
them to draw

668
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:30,079
a garden before and after a program

669
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,038
it's remarkable how they change we're

670
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,759
using

671
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,679
the arts as a way of understanding what

672
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,240
people are learning at younger ages

673
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,200
which is

674
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
really thrilling and then the rest of

675
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,159
the presentation what i'll be doing is

676
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
sharing with you

677
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
some quotes that i've pulled out from

678
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,599
reflective writing

679
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,519
what students say about what they get

680
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,278
out of this experience

681
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:57,440
and as melissa knows as alex knows

682
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,440
i don't see brian emmett here today but

683
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,079
we have thousands of pages of student

684
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,240
reflections about what they learn

685
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,319
and i promise you i'm not going to read

686
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,798
that much to you it was really hard

687
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,079
to crystallize it into short quotes for

688
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,720
this presentation

689
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,639
but that's what i'll be sharing with you

690
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,720
for the remainder

691
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
so one of the first things that we hear

692
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
and i it's one of my favorite parts of

693
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,519
teaching arts based approaches

694
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,960
is that students get new eyes because it

695
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,359
is fundamentally not

696
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
about learning to draw or paint it's

697
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,399
first about

698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
learning to see you first have to know

699
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,159
what you're looking at before you can

700
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,400
know what to do with it

701
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
and it blows people's minds when they

702
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
start to see what's out there

703
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,359
all the stuff that students have been

704
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
tuning out

705
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,798
their whole lives suddenly comes rushing

706
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,079
in and it is

707
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:51,200
nothing short of amazing miraculous

708
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,119
wonderment really and truly one

709
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
student said perhaps the ultimate

710
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,319
highlight of this course

711
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,519
is that has developed my sense of

712
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,319
observation

713
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,519
to a new level i can't stand still

714
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,240
without being aware

715
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,879
of incredible sights i don't just see

716
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,679
objects

717
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,480
as complete and whole entities i see

718
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
textures

719
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,919
light lines shapes tones shadings

720
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,439
motion that are beautiful just as

721
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
isolated parts

722
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,038
and just as i take in the appreciation

723
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,158
of independence

724
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,119
i see the whole again as a synthesis of

725
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,320
these parts

726
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:29,678
it's almost overwhelming to be so aware

727
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,038
and i feel in tune with nature in a new

728
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,960
way

729
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,599
another student emailed me just this

730
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,798
morning and said creativity comes

731
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,879
from deep observation she had that line

732
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,720
it reminds me of this poem and i love

733
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,679
this poem i actually got this from tom

734
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,839
whitlow

735
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,480
and i read it often i think it's just

736
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,240
great it's called the three goals by

737
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,798
david budville

738
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,759
and he says the first goal is to see the

739
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,278
thing itself

740
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:00,720
in and for itself to see it simply

741
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,000
and clearly for what it is no symbolism

742
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
please

743
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,679
the second goal is to see each

744
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,278
individual thing as

745
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,559
unified as one with all the other

746
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:15,359
ten thousand things in this regard a

747
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:18,158
little wine helps a lot

748
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,119
the third goal is to grasp the first and

749
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,120
the second

750
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,678
is to see the universal and the

751
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,239
particular simultaneously

752
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,440
regarding this one call me when you get

753
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,558
it

754
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,558
and the students

755
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,158
in the distance courses and here on

756
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,240
campus get it

757
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,080
they see it it's like they can see the

758
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,079
parts in the hole all at once

759
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,439
i have that feeling when i'm painting

760
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,759
and again it's just

761
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,880
it's just amazing the feeling that it

762
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,319
gives you

763
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,960
a sense of curiosity whether a student

764
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,759
is deepening their approach to a

765
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,319
painting

766
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,079
or working with plants and learning tree

767
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,119
sculpture

768
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,079
i hear again and again that reconnecting

769
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,119
with a sense

770
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,359
of what it is to

771
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,239
to be curious again is something that

772
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,639
they feel

773
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,558
horticulture 2010 has put me back in

774
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,038
touch with the feelings that originally

775
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,440
caused my interest in horticulture

776
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,919
somehow over the past few years through

777
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,080
my academics and work in horticulture

778
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,640
i've gotten away from those feelings of

779
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,720
wonder and curiosity that stem

780
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,840
from the creation both within

781
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,759
horticulture and

782
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,599
art i'm not saying that the class

783
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,839
changed my perspective

784
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,158
rather reintroduced me to one that

785
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,558
played such an important role

786
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,200
in my life so that's something that

787
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,240
comes up

788
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
again and again as the tas in these

789
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,919
classes know

790
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,360
we could we have thousands of pages

791
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,520
about how

792
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,439
stepping aside using a different part of

793
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,798
your brain getting outside doing

794
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,038
whatever you're doing

795
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,158
helps students and others to learn to

796
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,798
manage stress

797
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
this is at a workshop we did with adults

798
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,918
at um

799
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,439
longwood gardens through the american

800
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
horts society and i

801
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
i had so many pages but i'll just share

802
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,759
this quote with you

803
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,960
it's the only time in my week that i'm

804
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,119
not stressed out

805
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,679
it's really kind of sad but we hear that

806
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:17,038
quite a lot

807
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,080
healthy risk the biggest change i would

808
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,119
say i've seen

809
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,119
in in students and adult learners

810
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,000
through the distance courses in the last

811
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,319
decade

812
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,880
is they're terrified of of making a

813
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,079
mistake their fear of failure is just

814
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
insane i think people come in and again

815
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,319
i think you can have a sense

816
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,158
in one of these courses it's easy what

817
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,240
can it be you're just drawing

818
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,080
students don't know the rules they don't

819
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,278
know they'll come in they know how to

820
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,759
study for an exam but they are so unsure

821
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,558
of the creative process and we take big

822
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,720
risks

823
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,960
this is gandhian grass i don't know if

824
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,839
you saw this it was in mann library we

825
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,159
projected an

826
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,959
image on a canvas of grass that we had

827
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,000
grown

828
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,240
it was in a big black velvet box

829
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and we burned that image into the grass

830
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,599
and then it was revealed we didn't know

831
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,440
what we were doing we'd never done it

832
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,678
before it was a big risk

833
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
and it's on display in man library when

834
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,480
the students did this huge thing from

835
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,480
the air

836
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,079
the whole time we're saying what if what

837
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
if it's a bomb

838
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,119
what if we get up there and it doesn't

839
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,360
look like anything

840
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,359
it was a real thrill this is a student

841
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,678
who made the first grass dress

842
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,119
and she failed at it but we all learn

843
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,640
from it

844
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,639
this one student says

845
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,720
because this studio has opened the door

846
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,759
to creativity and more courageous

847
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,880
actions

848
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:44,879
i have become less hesitant in speaking

849
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,278
up in other classes a bit of a surprise

850
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
there

851
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,200
but again it's something i hear a lot of

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,359
improved mood

853
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,440
hey i got an improved mood from doing

854
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,038
this it's really well i mean why not say

855
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,240
that our work is fun

856
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,158
we're creating sod sofas and exploring

857
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,278
you know working with our discipline in

858
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,120
different ways

859
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,480
here we are in the lower left hand

860
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,398
corner we have that big

861
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,839
rooted installation that will be going

862
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,278
in down on

863
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:14,079
live slope and it's a it's a joyful

864
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,558
project that celebrates human well-being

865
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,879
and it's

866
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,000
in our connection to the plant world

867
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,000
we'll be launching that in april

868
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,319
realizing how important it is to take

869
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,079
time for what i love in this case making

870
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,558
something with my hands

871
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,720
has greatly improved my happiness i

872
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,440
don't think there's a person in the room

873
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,200
that can't relate to that a change in

874
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,038
attitude

875
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,200
and this can play out in a number of

876
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,278
different ways but this is one

877
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,759
short quote that i really liked learning

878
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:47,359
comes from trying new things

879
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,720
and not being perfect which is novel for

880
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,000
a cornell student

881
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,038
really not being perfect that's really

882
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,200
something right there

883
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,960
healing now here's an interesting one i

884
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,319
feel as if i'm getting into some tricky

885
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,759
terrain but i'll

886
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,519
back my way out of it and i'll tell you

887
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,679
why i do want to show you this piece

888
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,000
this is a color pencil from someone

889
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,759
from last year again way better than

890
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
anything i think i could come up with

891
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,558
it's just

892
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,240
absolutely a stunning piece of work that

893
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,119
you're looking at

894
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
i taught a class in recent years and

895
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,398
went around the room and said you know

896
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,159
what are you here for what do you hope

897
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,798
to get out of the semester

898
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,720
this first student who responded

899
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,599
indicated that they were recovering from

900
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,960
cancer

901
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:35,439
this is on campus here and

902
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,038
they were here for healing the second

903
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
student said well now that you've

904
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,679
admitted that

905
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,079
i will tell you that i took a mental

906
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,320
health leave and i'm back on campus and

907
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,240
i'm taking this class because of its

908
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,158
reputation for healing

909
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,079
they continued like that around the room

910
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,600
meanwhile i'm thinking oh man

911
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,199
i had no idea so you might be thinking

912
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,278
well wait a minute now is that our

913
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,278
responsibility here in horticulture to

914
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,079
offer a class that's fundamentally about

915
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,599
healing

916
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,038
you know aren't you going a bit out of

917
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:08,000
on a limb well it may not be explicitly

918
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,919
but we are all responsibility

919
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,839
responsible for the well-being of our

920
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,799
students and if we can do all of this

921
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,199
other

922
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,319
and have that be a reason that students

923
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
take our class

924
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,720
that is one big fat bonus let me tell

925
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
you

926
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,120
unusual application of horticultural

927
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,119
skills and knowledge expanding the

928
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,959
understandings of horticulture and what

929
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,079
we can do in our discipline

930
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,000
is another theme that comes up

931
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,079
here we are learning plant propagation

932
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but we're making tree sculpture

933
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,519
certainly the work inside and with

934
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
fibers and dyes

935
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960
you know it's just one more way that

936
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,120
students get to know our discipline i

937
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,600
often laugh about the student who said

938
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,278
i'm a real expert on dying she told me

939
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,558
this in class i said really well maybe

940
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,839
you should be helping me

941
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,240
should know the reason i'm telling you

942
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,278
is i wrote a 60 page paper on it

943
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,200
but never actually done it

944
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:03,679
so you know big expansion for her i love

945
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
this quote this is an old quote

946
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,000
it's from an ag ed major but i really

947
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,719
liked it as an agriculture education

948
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,119
major

949
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,959
i can definitely foresee doing this type

950
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,358
of activity in the future they were

951
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,878
referring to building assad sofa

952
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,799
i think high school students would

953
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,759
really appreciate breaking away from

954
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
textbooks

955
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,320
and getting to use their creativity in

956
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,879
the construction of a project like this

957
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,559
the turfgrass couch not only emphasizes

958
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,319
art but it can also fit into a

959
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,599
curriculum around plant science

960
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,399
horticulture

961
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,039
business management insect pest

962
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,279
management and numerous other subjects

963
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,960
since ag-ed is about real-life problem

964
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
solving and application

965
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
i really think this type of activity

966
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,280
would benefit numerous students

967
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,040
so i'm loving how they're taking what

968
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,159
they're learning and stretching it

969
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,759
in all different directions connecting

970
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,919
with something larger

971
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
this is category of you know the

972
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,239
students who really kind of go

973
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,199
a little bit further out there danielle

974
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,519
hodgins

975
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,199
many of you i think maybe didn't cross

976
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,759
paths with her she

977
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,559
she jumped ship from animal science came

978
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,320
into

979
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,799
the plant sciences and produced a sod

980
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,559
cow

981
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,960
these cows letters when she had

982
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,159
graduated she's the one who did the

983
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,119
mural in the hallway

984
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,719
it just it was her thing you know she

985
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,760
ended up going on to design

986
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,000
school and just she launched here she

987
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,760
really connected with something bigger

988
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,280
there are a couple very brief quotes

989
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,480
that i really liked that i've gotten

990
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,200
this semester

991
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,880
one i feel i see the potential in the

992
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,358
form and everything now

993
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,280
in puddles and leaves and fallen

994
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,078
branches and rocks

995
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,160
another student says regarding light

996
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
most of the plants or for that matter

997
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,920
our river

998
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,040
are coated with ice or frost the

999
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,838
shimmery light reflected is magnificent

1000
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,559
how do you capture it on paper maybe you

1001
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,960
don't

1002
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,358
maybe you just enjoy the moment for what

1003
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,358
it is

1004
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,480
greater confidence this sort of goes

1005
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,880
back to that risk taking

1006
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
but i love this many times at cornell we

1007
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
are challenged and it feels like we

1008
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,119
don't measure up but through the

1009
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
exercises we do in studio i always leave

1010
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,358
with a newfound sense that i

1011
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,800
can create these different forms of

1012
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,880
horticultural art

1013
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,480
it's a confidence boost that i wish more

1014
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,720
students could experience

1015
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,679
because it can really help students stay

1016
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,639
sane

1017
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:35,279
in this stressful environment so

1018
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,078
all of this it's not just a pretty

1019
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,839
picture

1020
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,400
there's so much more happening here

1021
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,000
i i'm going to actually offer for you i

1022
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,760
had thought about doing this and i

1023
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,880
thought it might be a bit of a leap for

1024
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,800
our seminar

1025
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,000
but i do want to offer the types of

1026
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,720
things that we actually

1027
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,079
do in these classes to get us to change

1028
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,078
our perspective

1029
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,560
you know it's these are just some sample

1030
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,359
exercises here's a negative space where

1031
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,679
they're drawing the spaces around

1032
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,519
the plant there's a lighting exercise

1033
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,159
where they're moving lights all over the

1034
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,400
place

1035
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,920
but here's one i have up here if anyone

1036
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
wants to take i have 25

1037
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
copies if you want to take them home

1038
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,358
they'll take a drawing and this was

1039
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,960
melissa's like

1040
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:21,279
oh my gosh aha moment when um

1041
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,119
they draw the they draw it upside down

1042
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,240
they take it like this and they draw it

1043
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
like this

1044
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,479
then they flip it over and when they do

1045
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,280
they're amazed at how accurate they've

1046
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
gotten

1047
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,320
because they're not labeling it as

1048
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
tulips

1049
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,720
they're just drawing line so it's all

1050
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,039
these little tricks that we can do

1051
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,959
to make this sort of left or right brain

1052
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,480
leap which is really

1053
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,480
really kind of exciting

1054
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,000
um so i'd like to conclude by um

1055
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,000
well here's another one of these

1056
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,719
surpasses me i just have to show you i

1057
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
just got that

1058
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,239
this one this week magnolia leaves and

1059
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,200
graphite

1060
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,319
it's just i mean just amazing that

1061
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,919
somebody can do this

1062
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,640
it looks like i don't know what it looks

1063
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,519
like it's just an extraordinary piece

1064
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,159
but i want to close with an excerpt from

1065
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,159
a poem

1066
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
and i think it captures our work here in

1067
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,799
this department

1068
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,480
it's called when death comes by mary

1069
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,160
oliver and i'm just going to share the

1070
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,240
last few lines

1071
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:27,519
when it's over i want to say all my life

1072
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,399
i was a bride married to amazement

1073
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,079
i was the bridegroom taking the world

1074
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
into my arms

1075
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,480
when it is over i don't want to wonder

1076
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,440
if i made of my life something

1077
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,079
particular

1078
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
and real i don't want to find myself

1079
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,680
sighing

1080
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,880
and frightened or full of argument i

1081
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,879
don't want to end up

1082
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,880
simply having visited this world

1083
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,320
and you know i do think that's the cool

1084
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
thing about our discipline

1085
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,800
it is not just about being observers

1086
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,960
it's not just visiting this world

1087
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,880
it's about pruning and feeling and

1088
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,679
touching and tasting and drinking

1089
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,920
and eating and growing and it's also

1090
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,239
about capturing in a beautiful way

1091
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
all of that activity in this particular

1092
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,639
way

1093
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,480
so i really appreciate your

1094
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,159
participation i want to say a few thank

1095
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
yous first to craig kramer

1096
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,598
a number of these beautiful images were

1097
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,960
shot by him he's always there in class

1098
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,119
he's always

1099
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,280
available and he makes us all look good

1100
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,400
by capturing our work in a particular

1101
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,800
way

1102
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
i want to thank lori brewer and liz falk

1103
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,119
my closest colleagues and

1104
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,800
cornell garden-based learning the

1105
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,519
teaching assistants

1106
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,640
in my courses some of you are here today

1107
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,119
and all of you

1108
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,279
i i'm i'm really well aware that i would

1109
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,720
not be able to give this type of seminar

1110
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,960
in every department

1111
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,000
you know it is it's different it's a bit

1112
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,880
different and i

1113
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,760
really appreciate that you have allowed

1114
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,680
for the growth of this type of work

1115
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,119
here in the department and i'd like to

1116
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,159
thank you

1117
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:10,800
so do you have any questions or comments

1118
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:13,199
we have a few minutes

1119
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,200
so much of what we like to do and what

1120
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,118
expands our minds and

1121
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,679
makes us relaxed is actually working

1122
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,318
with plants physically

1123
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,239
and what you've done is taken an extra

1124
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,039
step for you're interacting more

1125
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,639
actively

1126
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,639
as an artist but already that first step

1127
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,318
is really very valuable it seems to me

1128
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,400
and we will make sure that

1129
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,159
as we become more and more academic that

1130
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,800
we don't lose touch of

1131
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,799
the taxes

1132
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
thank you is that it's almost like this

1133
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,078
gets people in i mean it's one more way

1134
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,440
to get them in

1135
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,400
they're touching they're feeling they're

1136
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,079
tasting there's one assignment

1137
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,920
and it's my favorite assignment in the

1138
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,119
art of horticulture class

1139
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,559
that asks students to walk across campus

1140
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,480
looking up for one day that's it look up

1141
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,358
just look up when you're walking across

1142
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,679
campus and then write about it

1143
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:13,838
and it's both profound and horrifying

1144
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:16,719
because students will say i didn't know

1145
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,719
that it was fall

1146
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,358
once they start noticing the beauty of

1147
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,559
our landscape and wondering why they

1148
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,000
haven't looked up

1149
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,719
they start looking at each other's faces

1150
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,559
and really you know it's it's really a

1151
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,519
big deal and it's against one more

1152
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,838
entree

1153
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,880
into noticing this incredible world of

1154
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,239
plants around us

1155
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,720
yes you know as somebody who

1156
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,399
was first associated with the old

1157
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,000
department of floriculture and

1158
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,838
ornamental horticulture

1159
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,760
40 years ago this year um i viewed that

1160
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:55,199
department at that time

1161
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,880
as very traditional and i find it

1162
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:02,078
very encouraging particularly as we move

1163
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,280
into this unknown horizon of the

1164
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,920
plant science school that there is a

1165
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,519
marsha in sheepley associated with this

1166
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,720
department because i think that this

1167
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,239
need and i do feel it is a need to think

1168
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,279
creatively to think

1169
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:22,559
differently is going to be essential

1170
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,000
as we define the roles of

1171
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,920
our unit within the larger school yeah

1172
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,079
thank you and i but you know i think we

1173
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,200
have to communicate it

1174
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,318
and not let it get buried i mean and

1175
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:38,239
it is easy to misunderstand

1176
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,519
you know what what this type of work is

1177
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,639
about you think it's just

1178
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:45,119
pretty or does anybody at

1179
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:45,118
geneva

1180
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,039
yeah marsha i have a question about

1181
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,838
what you think about photography so it

1182
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,880
looked like you

1183
00:42:53,838 --> 00:43:00,159
teach primarily drawing and painting

1184
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,160
and i even got the impression that

1185
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,440
you were comparing drawing and painting

1186
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,838
to photography

1187
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,838
and and almost saying photography was

1188
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,199
not a creative art

1189
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,960
so i'm just wondering what you think

1190
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,960
about the creativity involved in

1191
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,079
photography and computer graphics and do

1192
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,400
you incorporate that

1193
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,519
into your teaching as well yes i do and

1194
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,000
i really appreciate

1195
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,639
if i i meant i didn't mean to give that

1196
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,719
impression

1197
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,639
i mean with that one particular slide it

1198
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,239
showed how you can know you can do

1199
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,879
something with one medium but not the

1200
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,118
other but

1201
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,240
two people in here have come in to teach

1202
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,440
in my class

1203
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,919
chris wayne and craig kramer to talk

1204
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,280
about

1205
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,039
you know the sort of basics of

1206
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
photography craig

1207
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,639
takes them through some digital

1208
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,639
manipulations that some students have

1209
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,279
just taken right off with

1210
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,838
so it's actually a real foundation in

1211
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,440
the course

1212
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,119
and a number of students in our

1213
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,039
horticulture a number of students in

1214
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,358
that course

1215
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,159
do a lot with photography as a creative

1216
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,559
project

1217
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,159
so thank you i'm really glad that i

1218
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,119
would not have wanted to leave you with

1219
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,078
that impression

1220
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,519
you're seeing my own you know i'm using

1221
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,318
visuals from my own

1222
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,679
uh skill set basically showing off

1223
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,559
paintings

1224
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,118
and that's all that's about any other

1225
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,880
questions

1226
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,680
or comments yeah yeah marsha i wonder if

1227
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,280
you could comment on

1228
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,440
sort of some of the differences between

1229
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,160
the you know the online course

1230
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,480
techniques you use and the in-person

1231
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,519
sort of stuff

1232
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,599
online you know i have i

1233
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:38,800
i online grew out of the campus work

1234
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,800
and part of it was

1235
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,799
when people get together in a room and

1236
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,879
do anything creative there's

1237
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,720
invariably the self-denigration of the

1238
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,079
campus it's amazing

1239
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,598
everybody thinks they're the worst one

1240
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,640
in the class everybody's looking at what

1241
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,039
other people are doing

1242
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,799
it's really interesting and you know i

1243
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,800
don't know what happens in middle school

1244
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,480
something happens that makes people feel

1245
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,318
really insecure about whatever it is

1246
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,880
they're doing and it comes up again and

1247
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,759
again

1248
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,119
so in 2005 i thought i wonder if online

1249
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
would actually be one of those

1250
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,599
environments

1251
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,318
in which it's better because nobody can

1252
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,920
see

1253
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:18,159
you know your work and in fact

1254
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,119
it is in some ways especially with

1255
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,679
adults

1256
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,519
who don't have that fear i'm the only

1257
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,239
one that has to see their work

1258
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,000
they can post it if they wish so the

1259
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,559
other the way in which it's different is

1260
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,559
just

1261
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,759
you imagine that you're being taught to

1262
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:33,358
draw or paint or

1263
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,280
work in charcoal or whatever it is

1264
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,440
online

1265
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,319
you have to really be sequential and

1266
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,039
step wise

1267
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,119
because i'm not there to talk to them

1268
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,719
anna-lysa has actually taken some of the

1269
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,400
course work you're welcome to share the

1270
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,199
experience but i think it's just

1271
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,079
super sequential and you do some

1272
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,838
readings

1273
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,079
in some of the courses you watch some

1274
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,559
videos and then you do

1275
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,160
do you upload your assignment and you

1276
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,400
also submit a piece of reflective

1277
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,920
writing every week

1278
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,280
so i think the way it's different is

1279
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,559
just it has to be really sequential

1280
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,519
for people to follow clearly does that

1281
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,759
answer your question sure

1282
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,440
and i can comment on taking an online

1283
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,640
one although i haven't taken it

1284
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,039
live so i can't compare but one thing

1285
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,920
that came to my mind was how we have to

1286
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,519
spend so much

1287
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,240
of our time here at cornell in the stuff

1288
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,119
that we are good at or supposed to be

1289
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,239
good at

1290
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,200
or you know like the things that we have

1291
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,358
spent time

1292
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,239
preparing for and for me not knowing

1293
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,000
anything about

1294
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,118
art and going into this just the basics

1295
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,119
just the basics

1296
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,720
reading the book that marcia referred to

1297
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,000
it was like oh who knew

1298
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:50,959
you know just so i was reminded of

1299
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,719
him a children's quote about the expert

1300
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
mind has very few

1301
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,959
possibilities but the beginner's mind

1302
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,519
has lots of possibilities

1303
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,880
and so that's part of what it did for me

1304
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,719
thanks

1305
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,720
any other comments or questions

1306
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,440
there are six handouts i didn't make

1307
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,159
tons of copies because i didn't know

1308
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,639
everyone would want them but there are

1309
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,960
there's

1310
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,838
there's a participation rubric that i

1311
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,039
just love

1312
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,759
it defines what participation is in my

1313
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,039
classes and there's some reflective

1314
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,359
writing guidelines

1315
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,480
and rubrics there's a final project

1316
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,000
guidelines

1317
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,639
and then there's that upside down

1318
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,318
drawing so that does give you a little

1319
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,480
window into that

1320
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,159
part and i again i know that i've taken

1321
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,559
one part of my work and bond

1322
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,679
into a deeply but if you ever have any

1323
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,599
other questions about

1324
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,919
you know that first jam-packed set of

1325
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,838
slides if you're curious about or you

1326
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,880
see opportunities for collaboration or

1327
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,199
something then

1328
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,240
don't hesitate to speak up so thank you

1329
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,239
for being attentive

1330
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,279
this has been a production of cornell

1331
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:07,838
university

1332
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,839
on the web at cornell.edu

1333
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:10,318
you
