1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,879
all right so thank you for showing up

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,620
today and thank you for giving me a

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,559
chance to talk to you about my research

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,539
as Joyce said I work for the USTA up in

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,910
Geneva and I work on grapevines my

8
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,820
position is as a research geneticist and

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,560
the USDA we have these specific sort of

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,509
regions that we work on and mine is

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,278
abiotic stress tolerance and because of

12
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,410
our location in western New York the

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,820
most important abiotic stress from

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,039
grapevines point of view is winter

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,730
stress cold stress so here you can see a

16
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,379
vineyard just south of Geneva in the

17
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,449
middle of winter and you can see that

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,800
it's very beautiful it's a really fun

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,100
place to work if you have the

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,989
appropriate clothing but from the vines

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,329
point of view this is very stressful so

22
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,730
there's no there's no canopy there's no

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,009
foliage the vine shut down is doing its

24
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,479
very best to survive complexity of

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,960
winter temperatures and make it to

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,489
spring so we're gonna go over a whole

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,189
bunch of concepts but that's the basic

28
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,109
overwhelming part of my talk is how do

29
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,368
grapevines make it through winter before

30
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,920
we go very far I just want to

31
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:10,140
acknowledge my student al Kowalewski a

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,728
lot of what I'm gonna present today has

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,978
come out of his thesis he's really

34
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,810
pushed this program in a way that I

35
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,030
didn't didn't think it was gonna go and

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,129
it's been really great so he's he's the

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,108
Brawn behind this and the brain behind

38
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:27,209
most of this talk so we're gonna

39
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:29,638
introduce grapevine Vitis vinifera is

40
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,399
the cultivated form of grape that gives

41
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:35,188
us these four wonderful end products at

42
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,858
the base here that was advancing this

43
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:41,578
slide here you go wine table grapes

44
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:43,530
juice grapes and raisins the vast

45
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,978
majority of global production comes from

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,868
this one species this species was

47
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,299
domesticated from its wild ancestor

48
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,879
sylvestris in the mediterranean region

49
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,039
of europe and this is important to us

50
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,810
from a winter temperature point of view

51
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,039
and an adaptation point of view because

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,748
if you look at what the minimum

53
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,450
temperatures along the Mediterranean

54
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:07,858
coast are you can see that they're not

55
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,379
that bad red and orange is negative 1 to

56
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:12,659
4 C for red and so these are these are

57
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,000
very mild winters from our perspective

58
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,939
so the hot dry summer cool mild winter

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,020
and so there's not a lot of need for

60
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,919
strong freezers

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,540
in these in Vitis vinifera it still

62
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,250
doesn't do a bad job of surviving winter

63
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,949
it can survive two temperatures about

64
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,080
negative 13 F I'm gonna primarily speak

65
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:34,199
in Celsius because that's how we take

66
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,930
our measurements so negative 25 degrees

67
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:41,579
Celsius is sort of the limit negative 13

68
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,020
degrees Fahrenheit so we care about cold

69
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,790
hardiness because temperature is one of

70
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,590
the leading factors that limit where we

71
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,840
can grow the crops that we grow and and

72
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,599
for sure for grape vines so here you can

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,159
see in this map this little black star

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,039
in the top right corner that's Geneva

75
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,810
and this arc is the 44th North latitude

76
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,539
that goes through France and Italy so

77
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,250
our latitude is comparable with the

78
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,810
Mediterranean but you can see by the

79
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,900
color graph we're nowhere near that red

80
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,039
and brown coloring it's much colder here

81
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,469
the value of the New York grape industry

82
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,989
is somewhere between 52 and 70 million

83
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:15,509
dollars and if we have a really bad

84
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,250
winter you can suffer up to 50 million

85
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,139
dollars worth of damage that depends

86
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,250
very much on the type of winter where it

87
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:26,129
strikes if you go into the Midwest they

88
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,460
can have almost complete crop loss from

89
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,019
a bad winter in New York we tend to grow

90
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,730
grapes in very specific regions in the

91
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,159
bottom map here and purple are the

92
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,239
primary wine regions there's two colors

93
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,129
of purple I'm not sure if you can see

94
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,680
the lavender but if you look at the

95
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,180
hardiness map those purple areas overlap

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,680
completely with the green areas in the

97
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,189
hardness map that's cuz we grow

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,319
cultivated grape right on its margin

99
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:51,359
we're at a spot where you cannot be sure

100
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,829
that Vitis vinifera will survive every

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,530
single year low temperature associated

102
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,140
stresses affect Vitis vinifera globally

103
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,569
so here's a map in purple our high frost

104
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,519
risk areas and so with this particular

105
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,079
aspect of cold hardiness we're talking

106
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,210
about the buds breaking early in spring

107
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,790
before the last threat of Frost has

108
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,230
passed if you have a frost it freezes

109
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,929
off you're growing tissues which include

110
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,230
your flowers means no crop so you can

111
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,030
see it affects it globally

112
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,530
but this interplays a lot with the way

113
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,929
that global climate is starting to shift

114
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,449
so here pictured in red areas in

115
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,790
California the Northeast and in Europe

116
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,159
our areas where we grow grapes now or

117
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,110
could grow grapes now climatically that

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,939
are expected to get too hot in the

119
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,290
summer to produce grapes and they're

120
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,740
going to shift towards these blue areas

121
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,090
in each case when you shift north that

122
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,650
may give us the right summer

123
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,539
temperatures but that puts us at risk of

124
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,969
more winter temperatures because they

125
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,750
doesn't necessarily mean warmer all the

126
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,820
time we have seen that winters are

127
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,970
getting warmer about in our region about

128
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:59,120
1 degree fahrenheit per decade and so

129
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,790
from 1970 we've warmed Y about 5 or 6

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,500
degrees Fahrenheit if you look at the

131
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,990
trend of the minimum winter temperatures

132
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,149
it is also going up and so it's getting

133
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,340
warmer and our winter extremes are

134
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,439
getting less but I also want to point

135
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,000
out here that the range in winters

136
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,180
extreme winter extremes goes from

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,149
negative 19 to 6 degrees so while it may

138
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,819
be warmer overall the variation in those

139
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,929
killing events is still very high so

140
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,849
when you put those together it becomes

141
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,420
very problematic for consistent

142
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,580
grapevine production this plays into how

143
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,150
global change and warming winters

144
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:37,639
affects the risk of freeze immense

145
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,289
normally a strong Jetstream protects

146
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,839
arctic air keeps it trapped at the poles

147
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,670
but as we warm in winter particularly in

148
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,859
the Arctic that jet stream gets weaker

149
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,199
which is shown here and that arctic air

150
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,879
can break out more often and we see that

151
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,310
manifest here in this third graph this

152
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,279
was the polar vortex when polar vortex

153
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,550
became a thing again a couple years ago

154
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,379
we had this breakout of polar air breaks

155
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,639
out of polar air that plunge down

156
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,069
through the Midwest caused a lot of

157
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,329
damage in a lot of crops and this is the

158
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,769
sort of event that will kill grapes

159
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,779
because if they get a mild winter

160
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:13,669
they're not prepared for this drastic

161
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:16,250
switch the way that we have been dealing

162
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,319
with this challenge on the margins is by

163
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,529
breeding new cold hardy hybrids and so

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,540
we use wild grapevine species in the

165
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:24,769
genus Vitus in North America there's

166
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,220
probably about 20 different varieties

167
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,629
and in Asia there's probably another 40

168
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,580
pictured here are some distribution maps

169
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,149
for different wild grape species and

170
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,870
this is a

171
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:38,419
the fruit we typically use Vitus ripe

172
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,740
area which hopefully you can tell the

173
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,990
difference in the green here the lime

174
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,850
green is the county level distribution

175
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,160
it's a very widespread species that goes

176
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,780
well up into Canada it happens to be one

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
of the most cold hardy species that

178
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:51,619
survives the coldest temperatures and

179
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,229
wild grape can survive to around

180
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,709
negative 35 to negative 40 C so it's

181
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:01,129
about a 10 to 15 degree C increase in

182
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,479
ability to survive winters so all of our

183
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,129
cultivar improvement for freeze

184
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,150
resistance comes from these wild species

185
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:11,589
we can't breed cold hardiness out of

186
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,589
vanilla it simply doesn't have the tools

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,050
so we talked about winter it's also very

188
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,699
complex we're talking about half of the

189
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,250
year at least maybe about eight months

190
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,839
extends from fall through the dormancy

191
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,610
period of winter into spring bud burst

192
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,899
during the time during this whole time

193
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,420
we have a number of different cold

194
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,069
related stresses frost is very important

195
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,439
in the fall and in the spring if you get

196
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,689
an early frost in the fall you can do

197
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,850
foliate the vine and that cuts off its

198
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,579
ability to prepare for winter if you get

199
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,370
a frost in the spring you lose sorry

200
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:49,819
about this or you lose your floral

201
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,769
tissue you can also have cold extremes

202
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,810
throughout the winter and if the vine

203
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:55,969
isn't prepared an early mid or late

204
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,589
winter you can suffer bud damage and

205
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,420
that has the same effect as killing the

206
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,639
flowers

207
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,740
we typically represent this as the

208
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,779
lethal temperature and it follows this

209
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,030
shape throughout winter the ability to

210
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,979
survive freezing increases in early

211
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,689
winter it's maintained through mid

212
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,319
winter and then lost quickly in the

213
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:17,810
spring so we call this acclamation

214
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,550
maximum hardness or maintenance and D

215
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,930
acclamation

216
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,090
so these are the two major concepts for

217
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,610
today dormancy and cold hardiness

218
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,379
dormancy is the period of the vine

219
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,509
basically being asleep keeping its

220
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,800
growth from occurring during

221
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,918
temperatures that are not growth

222
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,210
permissible it's necessary for grapevine

223
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,009
to go through this for it to have

224
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,259
synchronous bud burst and synchronous

225
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:41,939
flowering in the spring and the other

226
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,429
concept is cold hardiness which is very

227
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,920
complex but it involves freeze hardiness

228
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:48,719
freeze tolerance super cooling a bunch

229
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,120
of different factors that all go into

230
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,230
the general idea of the vine survives

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,269
all the freezing events of that year so

232
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,580
we do all of our work on dormant wood

233
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:01,889
and specifically with the bud and so

234
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,150
these are cuttings of grape each cut

235
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,580
into a single node and so there's a

236
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,220
little bud here we'll see some zum-zum

237
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,259
ends later but we do all of our work

238
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,610
taking samples from the field and

239
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,259
they're doing growth chamber experiments

240
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,230
so the primary aspect of my research

241
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,850
program is to full actually describing

242
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,259
the phenotype of what cold hardiness is

243
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,940
because this is something that's super

244
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,220
complex and we need to be able to target

245
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,470
aspects of it and I think of it as four

246
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,960
things how does the vine prepare for

247
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,840
winter how does it prevent changes in

248
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,129
physiology that result in growth how

249
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,200
does it survive sub-freezing

250
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:39,360
temperatures and then how does it time

251
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,660
bud burst in the spring so those four

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,730
factors are the phenotypes as from the

253
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,929
genetic point of view we want to know

254
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,850
what the genetic architecture of all

255
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,649
these traits are what we know from all

256
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,360
abiotic stresses is that it's Polly Gena

257
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,939
lots of different genes playing roles

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,629
and if we look at other literature we

259
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:01,800
see that cold often uses the same stress

260
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:03,480
pathways as salt drought heat and ABA

261
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,359
exposure and so basically the idea is

262
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,039
that all these abiotic stresses activate

263
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,440
a suite of transcription factors that

264
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,929
activated an even larger suite of

265
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,790
downstream genes to cause changes in the

266
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:17,759
plant and so we expect a lot of

267
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:19,169
crosstalk when we start unraveling some

268
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:24,740
of the genes behind this we expect to

269
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:24,740
find things for drought and for salinity

270
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,069
so if we cover a little bit of some of

271
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,419
these terms just so we're all in the

272
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,980
same page we want to talk a little bit

273
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,319
about dormancy and children chilling a

274
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,629
requirement the bud is a really

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,550
interesting entity and that it is

276
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,860
isolated from the rest of the vine

277
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,870
during the winter it's sealed off and is

278
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,419
able to measure the length of winter it

279
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,159
measures it through some sort of clock

280
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,919
system that we don't quite understand

281
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,860
but that clock runs between 0 and 11

282
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,929
degrees Celsius and so when the

283
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,820
temperatures outside drop below 11

284
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,799
degrees Celsius the bunk buds start

285
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,570
counting when it drops below freezing

286
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:05,519
they stop over the winter they need to

287
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,830
accumulate a certain amount in order to

288
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,179
be ready to grow in the spring and so if

289
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,520
you go out to the field and you grab a

290
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,099
cutting while this clock is running and

291
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,659
you put in the greenhouse it won't grow

292
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,519
this is called endo dormancy a specific

293
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:20,100
type of dormancy SAR internal dormancy

294
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,699
where physiology some physiological

295
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,769
parameters suppressing growth at some

296
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,720
point the clock is fulfilled and the

297
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,879
buds transition to something called eco

298
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,500
dormancy where if you go and you take

299
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,570
that bud and then remove it from the

300
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,129
field say in February it's still too

301
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,740
cold to grow but you put it inside will

302
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,809
now grow so this suppression has been

303
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,690
released and now dormancy is enforced by

304
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,319
the temperature at least two different

305
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,200
interactions these two different

306
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,420
dormancy parameters the length of that

307
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,640
brown bar the endo dormancy barrier can

308
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,079
be determined by genetic differences so

309
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,470
different species can have different

310
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,150
amounts of that clock and it can also be

311
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,160
determined by the environment so if you

312
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,629
have a very cold location the clock

313
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,490
needs to run a long time because you

314
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,950
don't spend a lot of time in that

315
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,409
temperature zone if you have a very mild

316
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,990
climate the clock is always running so

317
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:13,620
that arrow relatively speaking gets

318
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,990
smaller this is important because if you

319
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,970
transition to this eco dormant state in

320
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,450
an area that gets late winter

321
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,810
snap-freezes you can damage the vine so

322
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:28,830
once it moves into this eco dormant

323
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:30,929
state it's much more set sensitive we

324
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,310
measure this by taking cuttings putting

325
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:34,139
them into a growth chamber giving them

326
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,759
doses of chill and then seeing how long

327
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,439
it takes them to grow and when they're

328
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,990
fully when they're chilling requirement

329
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,089
is fully met

330
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,889
all burst synchronously when it's not

331
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:45,020
fully met you get a synchronous burst

332
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,639
this is a problem in the field because

333
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,379
if you get a synchronous first you get a

334
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,269
synchronous flowering and fruiting and

335
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:55,009
farmers don't like to have to harvest at

336
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:56,539
multiple times data wise if you plot the

337
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,458
days of budburst versus the chilling

338
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,708
hours you get this relationship the more

339
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:03,559
chilling that vine gets in that clock

340
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:05,689
region the faster it gets it growing if

341
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,549
you also look at it this way it also

342
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,870
gets more synchronous so these two

343
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:13,338
parameters are combined so when you're

344
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,570
planting a certain variety you have to

345
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,790
keep dormancy in the chilling

346
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,770
requirement in mind because not all

347
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:20,569
varieties can be grown everywhere from

348
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,759
this standpoint alone if you look at the

349
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,379
chilling hours that accumulate across

350
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,049
the United States you can see here in in

351
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,850
western New York we get lots 1,500 hours

352
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:31,250
that's because we've got the Great Lakes

353
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,769
the Finger Lakes in the ocean nearby it

354
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,690
makes us very mild if you look in North

355
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,949
and South Dakota they have less chilling

356
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,620
hours than we do even though their

357
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,629
winter is much harsher than us because

358
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,360
that clock is is stopped it's below

359
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:46,039
freezing so if you plant a high chill

360
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,139
variety in North or South Dakota it's

361
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,389
not going to break but on time the same

362
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:52,850
thing happens when the South is too warm

363
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,679
and we don't get a peach harvest if you

364
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,509
don't get enough chilling for peaches or

365
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,699
apples for all these different group

366
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:03,350
crops you won't get synchronous bursts

367
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:07,070
and synchronous fruiting if we just look

368
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,970
quickly at two years 2012 2013 was warm

369
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,230
for us we had 1,600 hours of chill by

370
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,389
the end of the winter whereas in South

371
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,850
Dakota at the same time point they only

372
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,189
had a thousand so here you would be able

373
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,278
to plant varieties that have chilling

374
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,630
hours that require a lot of chilling if

375
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,970
you plan it in South Dakota it won't

376
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:29,208
work if you go to a cold year you can

377
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:31,519
see that here we lost 300 hours so we

378
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,989
have to be very aware of the chilling

379
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,240
requirements of the crops that we plant

380
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,100
because you can inadvertently plant

381
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,450
something that's not going to do well

382
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,450
here from reduction point of view

383
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,109
if we then look at different wild

384
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,269
grapevines species we see that that

385
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,879
response is shared across all wild

386
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,279
species all wild species get faster at

387
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,470
growing with increasing gel but their

388
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,139
position on the y-axis both at the start

389
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,750
of winter and at the end is different

390
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,559
and so there are differences in the

391
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,240
chill response high medium and low and

392
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,679
if we look at them geographically by the

393
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,230
distribution it looks like southern

394
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,959
species typically need longer winters

395
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,480
than northern species this seems like a

396
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,860
bit of a paradox because you would think

397
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,019
that own orleans be she would want to be

398
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,330
prepared for a long winter but this is

399
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,069
from the point of view of that clock so

400
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,259
a northern winter is actually a very

401
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:28,330
short clock winter that makes sense so

402
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:33,370
what we see here is a potential adaptive

403
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:34,840
trait based on on geography so we can

404
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,789
now target these different species for

405
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,740
different dormancy chilling requirement

406
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,149
aspects and I'm gonna bring your

407
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,560
attention back to ripe area because we

408
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,649
use ripe area a lot for cold hardiness

409
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:48,609
you can see that it's on the northern

410
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:51,309
distribution low chill response side in

411
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,810
the germplasm and genève i've access to

412
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,459
lots of different accessions from across

413
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,399
the country and so we looked at 43 of

414
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,009
these and if we group them into southern

415
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,049
and northern groups and you squint a

416
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:03,639
little bit at it you can see that the

417
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,669
blue is on the lower side and the Gert

418
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,259
and the orange is on the upper side so

419
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,139
it looks like and then this the color

420
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:12,909
coding is preserved here in this column

421
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,069
it looks like things from the south

422
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:17,079
tend to have slightly longer dormancy so

423
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,120
it looks like that species level

424
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,430
distribution in north to south is

425
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
possibly preserved within widely

426
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,329
dispersed species as well so there may

427
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,750
be a gradient within ripe area for the

428
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,210
same trait so this is cool because now

429
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,610
we have ripe areas that we can use to

430
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,470
breed for longer winters and we want

431
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,210
that for up here because we have what

432
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,680
what the clock thinks is a really long

433
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,330
winter

434
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,829
so we're now working with the grapevine

435
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,720
breeder and Cornell to use some of this

436
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,940
material for breeding rather than

437
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,740
choosing the stuff from Manitoba which

438
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,720
is believed to be very cold hardy but

439
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,220
has a very short requirement so dormancy

440
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,290
protects the buds from growing when the

441
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,778
temperatures are lethal there's two

442
00:16:56,289 --> 00:17:00,879
parts of dormancy to protect against

443
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:01,629
temperature and there's one portion

444
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,708
where it's protecting against

445
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,140
temperature and there's another portion

446
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,129
words very responsive to temperature the

447
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,900
dormancy level in the chilling

448
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,360
requirement is important for what types

449
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,740
of cultivars you plant and it looks like

450
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,958
there's a geographic gradient for this

451
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,699
tree so that's kind of cool to me from a

452
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,660
sort of like a natural adaptation and

453
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:21,039
natural evolution kind of point of view

454
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,350
the other part of my research that

455
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,789
overlaps with dormancy is the ability of

456
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,099
the blood to survive freezing events

457
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:30,069
this is a picture of a grapevine bud

458
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,349
that has been cut and then split open

459
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:34,689
okay so this is the base of the bud here

460
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:37,719
and this is sort of like the decapitated

461
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,730
top of the bud right in the center there

462
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,339
is a dead primary bud there's a there's

463
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,839
it's a compound bud there's three buds

464
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:46,178
in there the primary the secondary and

465
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,039
the tertiary the primary is the weakest

466
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,500
and has the floral tissue for the next

467
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,299
year in this particular picture you can

468
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,558
see the primary is dead and oxidized and

469
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,139
the secondary and tertiary are still

470
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,460
alive so this had a precise cold

471
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,050
treatment that killed only the primary

472
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,558
we can determine the temperature that

473
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,819
kills the primary through this

474
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,799
differential thermal analysis method so

475
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,200
we cut the bud off of the cane we put

476
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,000
them in these little chambers in these

477
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,220
plates and then put the plates in a

478
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,299
programmable freezer we slowly freeze

479
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,339
the buds and we measure voltage across

480
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,710
that plate and basically what we're

481
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:25,500
doing is we're measuring the freezing of

482
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,210
water so as temperature decreases

483
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,210
there's this large spike in voltage as

484
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,130
external water freezes this is a heat

485
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:38,019
release which changes the voltage of the

486
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,400
plate as the extracellular water freezes

487
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,829
over time as the temperatures are

488
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,980
decreasing the bud is surviving all of

489
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:46,779
this presumably dehydrating at some

490
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,460
point it's still alive and as long as

491
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:52,250
you go back and forth between these two

492
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,730
stages freezing and thawing it's fine

493
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,769
when that internal water freezes is it

494
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,329
lethal and that's what we measure here

495
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,389
these little spikes are five primary

496
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:03,949
buds dying we take the average of that

497
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,830
and then we can plot the survivability

498
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,259
through winter that's what I'm showing

499
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:11,119
here so here's temperatures these two

500
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,980
curves down here in purple and green are

501
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,989
cab Sauve and Riesling - vanilla

502
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,539
varieties and you can see that you

503
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,200
shaped curve I showed you earlier

504
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,480
acclimation maintenance and d

505
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,970
acclamation so each of these points are

506
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:30,950
the average of the lethal events for

507
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:32,809
those buds part of what we're doing is

508
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,340
trying to understand how the buds are

509
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,779
changing through winter because we want

510
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,000
to understand how to maximize their

511
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,619
ability and there are some really cool

512
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,019
models that have come out where they're

513
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:43,579
trying to predict Bud hardiness so that

514
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,960
farmers have a tool for when they need

515
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:47,210
to go out and make viticulture

516
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,400
modifications to deal with cold events

517
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,470
the best current model is this Ferguson

518
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,800
model and what I want to show you here

519
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,660
is how bad the Ferguson model is in the

520
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,669
East it works really great in Washington

521
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,130
State or it was developed on like 23

522
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,740
different cultivars what you see here in

523
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,050
black is actual data and then in orange

524
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,670
is the prediction you can see that it

525
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,529
has problems in both early and late

526
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,509
parts of winter in over predicting

527
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,970
hardiness this is the problem if you're

528
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,339
using this as a farming tool and it also

529
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,579
has a hard pan it can't the buds can't

530
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:22,009
gain hardiness past a certain level so

531
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,569
we're working with this model and the

532
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,369
different aspects of cold hardiness to

533
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:32,000
try to correct it and then also learn a

534
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:34,250
bit more about phenotype what I'm

535
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,170
showing here are three years of data for

536
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,410
three different species and blue is

537
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,360
Vitis vinifera in green and yellow or

538
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,279
Vitus riparian Vitus Emmure Ensis those

539
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,819
two species are very cold hardy one from

540
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,200
north america one from asia in 2012-2013

541
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:51,609
it's a very warm year

542
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,220
actually before we get into that let's

543
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:55,899
look at some general trends what we see

544
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,279
with our data are cold hardness data is

545
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,019
that when you have a cold event in

546
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,139
winter the buds tend to respond by

547
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:03,700
gaining cold hardiness when you have a

548
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,910
warming event they tend to respond by

549
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,069
losing cold hardiness but it's not

550
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,570
always true at all points in the winter

551
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,519
so you can see in this particular year

552
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,279
the first cold event resulted in

553
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,990
acclamation the second cold event only

554
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,289
resulted in acclamation in the yellow

555
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,940
cultivar in this year the trend is

556
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,889
reversed the first cold event had no

557
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,539
effect the second one dead so we're

558
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,280
trying to figure out what what makes

559
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,500
these cold events different what is the

560
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:33,149
vine actually cueing off of

561
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,690
if we look at my disputes a little more

562
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,950
integrated cold in the middle line you

563
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,250
mean they're all working together doing

564
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,600
the same thing well it looks like the

565
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,730
environment was a little colder in the

566
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,719
middle one than in the right ones oh

567
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,849
here yeah well between these three years

568
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,589
they're actually three perfect perfect

569
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,779
comparisons this is a very warm year we

570
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,429
had one cold event this is this is the

571
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,160
freezing point here and these are

572
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,740
minimum temperatures in this year we had

573
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,080
very punctuated winter very cold warm

574
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,359
very cold warm and this year we had

575
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,740
tremendous sustained cold I'm not sure

576
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,939
if you were if you were all here for

577
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,670
this but this was like the two and a

578
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,080
half months of nothing but freezing so

579
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,350
they're very different winters from the

580
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:18,029
vines point of view if you look at a

581
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:19,859
mere inches maximum cold hardiness

582
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:22,440
across those three years what I want you

583
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,689
to notice as it moves in each year it's

584
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,610
in a different position and arrow points

585
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,350
the point in winter when it was at mass

586
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:31,349
you can see that that arrow moves as

587
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:33,329
well if you look at the other two

588
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,009
varieties now in comparison you can see

589
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,929
if you phenotype for this trait in a

590
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,119
warm year there's no difference between

591
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,400
these three species if you use a

592
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,019
punctuated year Bennifer it suddenly

593
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,000
looks sensitive and the two wild species

594
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,500
look tolerant and then if you go to a

595
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,740
very cold year you start seeing

596
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,930
separation across all three species this

597
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,630
makes it really challenging to study

598
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,130
from a point of view because so much of

599
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,980
the phenotype is derived from the

600
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,690
environment so the type of winter nests

601
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,630
the type of winter is determining the

602
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,279
cold hardiness in any given year the

603
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,040
other thing to note is that the buds

604
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,960
don't automatically super cool or gain

605
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,319
the maximum amount of freeze hardiness

606
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,490
and every year they need to be pushed so

607
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,659
it's not an automatic on/off switch we

608
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,039
want we still want to understand what

609
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,970
the genetic architecture of this trade

610
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,059
is though because we need to provide

611
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,259
tools to the farmers so we did the same

612
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,179
thing as I did with the dormancy we

613
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:28,589
looked at 43 different ripe areas to see

614
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,500
if we could understand what's going on

615
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:33,869
this is what the data looks like it's 43

616
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,609
different curves through winter if you

617
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,669
take all of that data and you load it

618
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:40,559
into some statistical modeling you can

619
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,940
get a simplified version of what's going

620
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,099
on and so that's what I'm showing here

621
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,650
in

622
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,629
is the least hearty ripe area and yellow

623
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,160
is the most hardy ripe area and there's

624
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,370
about five degrees of tolerance

625
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,250
difference in those two genotypes the

626
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:57,369
other forty-one accessions are somewhere

627
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,369
in between

628
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:02,940
so the interesting thing here is if you

629
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,159
you act asked the statistical model is

630
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,350
there specific is there significant

631
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,320
differences between the most and least

632
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:11,849
cold-hearty there is in this five degree

633
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,638
parameter but not in the shape of the

634
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:17,158
curve so that means that at any one

635
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:18,658
point in the winter the least Hardy and

636
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,879
the most Hardy are responding to

637
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,429
temperature perception in the same way

638
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,558
they're gaining relatively amount the

639
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,960
same relative amount of their phenotype

640
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,319
both down and up in response to

641
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,429
temperature so it's not really we're not

642
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,618
really seeing a difference here in a

643
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,298
cold hardiness trait we're seeing a

644
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,980
difference in something that happens

645
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,989
before we start this experiment we

646
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,288
started this experiment as soon as the

647
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:45,929
leaves fall in in the fall what we think

648
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:48,269
is going on is that the time that these

649
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,679
vines are shutting down is the time that

650
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:51,118
they start tracking temperature and

651
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,580
they're able to take advantage of cues

652
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:55,798
telling them to go cold hardy and I use

653
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:57,599
an analogy of starting on a track race

654
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,700
where some runners start out ahead and

655
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,928
instead of them all looping around are

656
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,119
doing the same distance imagine it's

657
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:05,278
just a straight line so whoever starts

658
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:11,189
winter first has the greatest potential

659
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:13,200
for the cold hardiness in that year if

660
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,519
we if we run the model backwards so now

661
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,649
we're just guessing at what's going on

662
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,319
we see about a 2-week difference in what

663
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,608
we think these lines are going to sleep

664
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,888
so now we're starting to turn our eyes

665
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:27,058
away from this particular part of the

666
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:28,439
trait and more towards this part another

667
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,178
thing I want to bring up here is an

668
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,580
interesting observation that has come

669
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,548
out of viticulture literature if you

670
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,528
spray a vine with ABA when the fruit is

671
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:40,108
setting you can actually induce cold

672
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:41,759
hardiness but the interesting thing you

673
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:44,220
do is you induce it in a parallel

674
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,769
fashion so if you spray a variety with

675
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,139
ABA it goes dormant a little bit earlier

676
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,970
and it gains cold hardiness throughout

677
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:53,398
the winter in a parallel fashion much

678
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,069
like we're seeing here so this might be

679
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,178
some evidence that this early

680
00:25:55,069 --> 00:26:01,710
acclimation early dormancy is what we

681
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:03,180
really need to be looking at so

682
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,650
genetics point of view and a genetic

683
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,330
mapping point of view the question is

684
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,820
how do you work with this trait because

685
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:12,449
it's it's an unwieldy crop it's highly

686
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:15,659
influenced by the environment when we

687
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,940
make crosses because the winters are

688
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,560
severe here we're always crossing sort

689
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,690
of a moderately cold hardy bhaiyya

690
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,819
very cold hardy so our phenotypic

691
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,630
separation is really bad we really want

692
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:29,159
to be making this cross so the way that

693
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,720
we've approached it in my group because

694
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,180
I can't grow sensitive vines here

695
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,360
they'll die every year is to break it

696
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,539
down into bits so if we just focus on

697
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,939
the acclamation we want to understand

698
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,940
how do cold events trigger gains of cold

699
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,830
hardiness some things that we know

700
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,049
colder winters give you more hardiness

701
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:51,809
so colder temperatures should give you

702
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:53,579
more hardiness we want to know if all

703
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,859
temperatures trigger acclamation in the

704
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,919
same way and if we can develop any new

705
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:00,569
phenotyping so if you do this as a

706
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,220
thought experiment if you take dormant

707
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,809
cuttings from the field and you put them

708
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,829
into different growth chambers and you

709
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:06,710
give them different temperatures you

710
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:09,149
should see differences in acclamation

711
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,150
that's what's pictured here so maybe we

712
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,769
just phenotype all in the growth chamber

713
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,000
when we look at what happens if we do

714
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:16,319
that with Chardonnay in this case so

715
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,119
this is Chardonnay in the field

716
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:22,559
this is Chardonnay in the growth chamber

717
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,879
at 2 &amp; 7 we see that there's although

718
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,559
there's a separation there in those

719
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,060
best-fit lines there's no actual

720
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,659
difference between these two responses

721
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,819
if we look at the temperature in this

722
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,500
first two data points we see that in the

723
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,419
field it was 7 degrees Celsius on

724
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,549
average so it should be like the yellow

725
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,160
line but we see acclamation so we're

726
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:42,299
missing something

727
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,930
if we look at what temperature looks

728
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,269
like in the field here's the 7 average

729
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:51,049
we're actually seeing a lot of movement

730
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:53,480
right around that 7 average so maybe

731
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:55,789
it's the temperature swing so we did the

732
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,069
experiment put them in a growth chamber

733
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:00,950
with it averaged 7 with a 5 degree swing

734
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:03,409
just like outside so here's the data and

735
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,960
static temperature here's the data and

736
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,360
static versus cycle so this is really

737
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,920
cool they all gained cold hardiness and

738
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,349
this is a significant gain of cold

739
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,120
hardiness if you cycle the temperature

740
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:15,829
so they're not paying attention to the

741
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,139
average temperature there's something

742
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:19,519
about the lows and highs that is

743
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,830
signaling to the vine to gain cold

744
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,529
hardiness the other neat thing that's

745
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:26,569
here is the - so this is at 2 degrees

746
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,950
Celsius and then we moved it into a

747
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,069
cycling chamber which means we actually

748
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,680
moved it into a warmer environment

749
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:36,019
because the mean is now 7 and it gained

750
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,250
cold hardiness so it's actually blind

751
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:41,869
estatic temperatures they don't do

752
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:44,509
anything from this we're able to come up

753
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:45,829
with a new parameter called Sigma T so

754
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:48,230
it's basically looking at the

755
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:50,569
fluctuations in temperature and when we

756
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,819
add that to the model we fix the

757
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:55,490
acclimation problem here so what they're

758
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:58,279
missing in the Washington model that we

759
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:00,109
have here is that erratic high-low

760
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:04,339
cycling in Washington it's much more

761
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:05,509
constant so now what we're doing is now

762
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,250
that we know how to actually make them

763
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:09,349
acclimate we're trying to look at the

764
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,240
gene expression profiles that are going

765
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:12,409
on during this process so we're

766
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,670
collecting the tissues now cuz we

767
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,370
finally sort of narrowed in on the

768
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,620
telomeres Network so that'll be I'll

769
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:20,989
come back and talk in a couple years let

770
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:22,549
you know how that goes the other side of

771
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,809
this is D acclimation and D acclimation

772
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:26,029
this is a little bit easier to

773
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:29,839
understand here it's the response to

774
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:32,839
binds to warm temperature if we look at

775
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,419
I bring up chilling hours again because

776
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:39,049
as you gain chilling hours you gain

777
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,810
faster growth and if we look at the

778
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:44,149
budburst phenotype in a growth chamber

779
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:46,789
what we're actually looking at us is two

780
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,890
things combined its how fast it takes to

781
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,720
grow but it we're also looking at how

782
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,509
much time it takes to lose cold

783
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,049
hardiness to get to a growth state right

784
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:59,869
so it's two parts if we look at the

785
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:02,149
number of days to lose cold hardiness we

786
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:04,429
see this sort of relationship that if

787
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,630
you test at several different

788
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,560
temperatures so you take cuttings you

789
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,000
put them in two different growth

790
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,339
chambers you measure how fast do they

791
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,549
lose hardiness we see a linear response

792
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:18,980
at any one temperature so this is a lot

793
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:21,379
easier than the cycling if we look at

794
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,789
our again our curve and this box

795
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,500
indicates the temperatures we're

796
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:26,450
chilling accumulates if you go out to

797
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,000
the field and collect material

798
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,980
throughout winter at this point and you

799
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,019
put it in a warm temperature and you try

800
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,230
to deactivate it won't deactivate it

801
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:39,650
will not lose cold hardiness as you go

802
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,269
through winter that changes the longer

803
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,490
winter goes the more chilling that goes

804
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,650
the deactivation becomes faster at that

805
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,819
given temperature and so what we're

806
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,680
seeing is this relationship between

807
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:51,079
chill accumulation and D acclimation

808
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,240
speed whereas you are always capable of

809
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:57,259
D acclimating but in the beginning

810
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,609
you're really really slow and the reason

811
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,379
we're using planes is because I don't

812
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:02,000
have a mathematical mind and I have to

813
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,340
work with cartoons to understand this

814
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,529
but basically at the beginning of winter

815
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:08,240
D acclimation is like a plane taxiing

816
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:10,278
it's moving but it's moving really

817
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,038
really slow

818
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:16,940
as a games chillin it takes off and then

819
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,348
it meat makes its maximum speed what we

820
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,119
think is going on is these sections

821
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:21,739
represent those eco dormancy or

822
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:24,579
endodermis seed transition and eco

823
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,579
dormancy periods

824
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,120
the other thing to note about this is

825
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,370
while these are linear responses the

826
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,889
rate at low temperature is lower than

827
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,779
the rate at high temperature so if your

828
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:41,910
D acclimating at a low temperature your

829
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:43,379
decla mating at a lower optimal rate so

830
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,600
full-speed depends on the airplane the

831
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,920
rate of D acclamation depends on the

832
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:52,379
temperature your D acclimating at so if

833
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,930
we look at Cabernet Sauvignon and you D

834
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,570
acclimate it at 10 degrees Celsius as

835
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,240
chills as chilling accumulates you can

836
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:03,329
see this response it'll lose about half

837
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,890
a degree of hardiness per day but if you

838
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:07,710
D acclimate it at 22 degrees Celsius

839
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,890
it'll lose one and a half so it's not a

840
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,120
linear relationship based on temperature

841
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,350
the other thing interesting thing is if

842
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,419
you look at cultivar differences

843
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:17,469
Riesling d acclimates a little bit

844
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,269
faster at 10 C

845
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:24,788
and a lot faster at 22 C so depending on

846
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:27,099
this profile will give you an idea of

847
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:29,200
how fast you'll break in the spring it's

848
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:33,490
a reflection of how you're responding to

849
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,319
warming temperatures if we take those

850
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,700
parameters now cultivar specific D

851
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,099
acclamation parameters and plug them

852
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,080
into the model we fix the tail end of

853
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:44,288
the model so we've captured the two

854
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:46,359
portions of this response that are

855
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,769
unique well it's not unique to the

856
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,849
Northeast we see it in the Northeast

857
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,089
because our temperatures are more

858
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,089
variable

859
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,050
the other thing I want to show you is

860
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,210
how this compares to other species

861
00:32:55,049 --> 00:33:00,389
so here's Cabernet Sauvignon again 10

862
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,920
and 22 here's Riesling if you look at

863
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,509
vitae Sam you're Ensis so this is the

864
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,779
wild species they use for cold hardy

865
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:09,390
breeding in Asia it diakonos at 10 C at

866
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:12,509
the same rate as caps off does at 22

867
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:15,150
it's incredibly timed as soon as there's

868
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:17,579
the slightest bit warming it gets ready

869
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,440
to break bud this is a serious problem

870
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:23,429
if you include this trait in a hybrid in

871
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,640
an area like New York at 22 C its it's

872
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:28,650
off the charts right pareo which is our

873
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,290
our favorite cold hardy species in North

874
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,420
America is also faster than recently in

875
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:35,909
cab sub it's not as not as fast as by

876
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,430
December ANSYS but if you look at it at

877
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,110
22 C it catches up so the relative

878
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,029
differences between these species are

879
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,949
it's really interesting to to see that

880
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,609
there are different components of this

881
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:50,690
phenotype itself what we learned from

882
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:53,099
this from a genetic mapping kind of

883
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,470
approach is that we now have a phenotype

884
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:58,230
that we can look at if we're trying to

885
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,309
select for increased responsiveness to

886
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,980
temperature or decreased responsiveness

887
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:04,079
of temperature typically here we want

888
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,950
decreased response so that we don't have

889
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,689
early budburst

890
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,389
but for table grapes in Southern

891
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,700
California they want tea acclamation

892
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:15,149
that really really rapidly acclamation

893
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:17,279
because they don't have long winters so

894
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:20,279
we now know we want to phenotype at

895
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,649
around 1,500 hours of chill but we also

896
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,179
see that northern species are bringing

897
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:26,190
along along with cold hardiness they're

898
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,168
bringing along this rapid d acclamation

899
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,760
phenotype that we don't really want so

900
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:33,599
now I have to somehow break those two

901
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,220
things apart that's possible how this

902
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,418
bears out when you look at data so now

903
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,069
this is the same data I showed you

904
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:41,339
before but now I color-coded it to match

905
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,169
here as you can see based on the

906
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,530
responsiveness of M urine sassette 10 C

907
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:48,000
why we have so much loss in midwinter in

908
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,490
a mere Ensis and we don't see the same

909
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,980
loss in ripe area but at the end of the

910
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:55,138
season when chilling has maximized we're

911
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,539
starting to warm up we start to see the

912
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,800
same same levels of D acclamation so it

913
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:00,800
starts to make sense with the field data

914
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,380
so another cool observation that comes

915
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,200
out of this is looking at these three

916
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,480
varieties so Cab Franc and Sauvignon

917
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,689
Blanc are two and cabs are burnin yon

918
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,150
Cabernet Sauvignon are three varieties

919
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,679
that happen to have this pedigree Cab

920
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,990
Franc and South Blanc are the parents of

921
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,219
caps off it so we have sort of like a

922
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:27,048
local small breeding family to look at

923
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:29,108
if we look at their response here soft

924
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:31,880
Blanc at ten and twenty two

925
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:34,929
here's Cab Franc at ten and twenty two

926
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,088
and here's cab saw at ten and twenty two

927
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:41,078
so what's neat about this is it tells us

928
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:43,038
that we really want to be perhaps

929
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,150
phenotyping at this warm temperature

930
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,650
because we can exaggerate the

931
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,230
differences between genotypes

932
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,389
but then comparing it with a colder

933
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,490
temperature may give us a better idea of

934
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:53,568
what they're doing at different stages

935
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:57,159
and so we could be selecting for

936
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,159
different aspects of the stray

937
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,659
the other thing we're doing with D

938
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,039
acclamation is the same thing I

939
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,989
mentioned in acclamation is that we're

940
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,539
collecting data on gene expression and

941
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:10,118
so as the vine is d acclimate d

942
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:12,489
acclimating we collect bud tissue and do

943
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,769
RNA RNA seek on those samples we did

944
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:16,689
this on four different varieties

945
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:19,989
Riesling caps off Emmy rensis and ripe

946
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,260
area and this is a heat map which I

947
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:23,108
don't

948
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,940
it looks really washed out but um I'm

949
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:27,098
sure you've seen heat maps from gene

950
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,990
expression before basically if we look

951
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,210
at how time affects this we have a major

952
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:33,399
group of genes that are upregulated

953
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:36,699
during D acclamation and a major group

954
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,849
of genes that are down regulated excuse

955
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:41,559
me when we do pathway enrichment like

956
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,269
which how many genes are in different

957
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:45,219
pathways are there any over-represented

958
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:48,369
pathways but one thing that popped out

959
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:51,338
repeatedly in all four varieties is the

960
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:53,530
ABA pathway and so in the ABA pathway we

961
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:57,549
have carotenoid biosynthesis leading is

962
00:36:53,530 --> 00:37:00,220
an Thaksin getting two ABA ABA can then

963
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,530
be degraded signal or be put in an

964
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:06,669
activation reactivation pool and if we

965
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:08,740
look at how gene expression occurs each

966
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,690
day during D acclamation so that's what

967
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:13,629
these squares are you can see that

968
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:15,250
biosynthesis is shut down conversion is

969
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,588
shut down degradation is shut down

970
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,119
signaling a shutdown and the inactive

971
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:21,190
pool is the only thing that is sort of

972
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,869
being upregulated so it's sort of like

973
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,880
the vine or the bud is purging ABA this

974
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:31,180
makes sense from what we know about the

975
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,760
antagonistic aspects of ABA and GA ABA

976
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:36,098
represses ga-ga is were responsible for

977
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,990
growth that's what's happening during d

978
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:40,359
acclamation is a gradual conversion from

979
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:43,568
no growth to growth so this makes a lot

980
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:46,150
of sense so what we wanted to do from

981
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:48,900
and this is by no means complete this is

982
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,889
just like the easiest nugget to show you

983
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,200
what we've done though is we've taken

984
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:55,299
this result and we've moved it into

985
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:58,088
trying to translate this into a bit of

986
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,670
culture method for growers and so what

987
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:02,710
we did is we looked at the effect of ABA

988
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,780
on the on the phenotype of D acclamation

989
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,730
so if you look at the normal

990
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,160
deactivation pattern here in yellow you

991
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,460
can see over time you lose cold

992
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,659
hardiness

993
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:17,329
if you spray the buds with an ABA spray

994
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:20,539
you can stop D acclamation and shift

995
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:22,220
this port the bud break phenotype by

996
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:26,150
quite quite a distance here it's like a

997
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:29,539
30 days if you look at what that looks

998
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,789
like from the grouse plant look here on

999
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:34,130
the left is control here's 1 millimolar

1000
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,230
ABA 5 miller molar ABA you can see that

1001
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,230
there's a clear suppression of growth

1002
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,280
and a clear delay relative to control

1003
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,809
the other thing that we're doing is

1004
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,540
comparing this to methyl jasmine 8

1005
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,369
another stress responsive hormone to see

1006
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,838
if we could trigger similar pathways

1007
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,599
with a different plant hormone you can

1008
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:53,119
see here in 5 millimolar methyl Jasmine

1009
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,260
8 and 2.5 millimolar methyl jessamine

1010
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,000
that we're getting some of the same

1011
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,099
phenotype but it's not as Extreme as ABA

1012
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,929
and so we've hope we've dissected the

1013
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:05,119
the different aspects of cold hardiness

1014
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:06,799
apart with the goal of trying to come up

1015
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,130
with genes that are important but then

1016
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,530
also give growers maybe a field

1017
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,940
mitigation method should we have warm

1018
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,940
events in in late winter

1019
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:21,190
so just to wrap all of this up dormancy

1020
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,449
acclimation maintenance of coal hardness

1021
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,760
and d acclamation are a suite of

1022
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:27,519
physiological and genetic traits it's

1023
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,400
all very complex temperature perception

1024
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,349
is clearly playing a major role we don't

1025
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,050
know what the temperature the tension

1026
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,820
temperature sensor is in the bud there's

1027
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,990
not a lot of actively growing tissue but

1028
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,109
something is keeping track of

1029
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:43,389
temperature acclamation is far more

1030
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:45,159
complicated than just perceiving an

1031
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:47,920
average temperature temperature so it's

1032
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,379
not just colder gives you more

1033
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,730
acclamation there's colder and variable

1034
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,150
temperature swings that gives you a

1035
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,449
clinician the acclamation and chilling

1036
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,769
requirement they appear to be adaptive

1037
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:02,199
and we seem to have a really nice

1038
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:03,608
phenotype now for deploying to mapping

1039
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,529
studies so one of the problems with

1040
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:07,900
grapes is that we don't have a if you

1041
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,310
make a mapping family you don't have a

1042
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,470
lot of space for your plants and you

1043
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,900
don't have a lot of tissue from any one

1044
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:16,000
individual and so this might give us a

1045
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,349
way to finally start phenotyping because

1046
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,559
we've narrowed in on something that

1047
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:23,349
actually changes in a consistent way and

1048
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:25,329
finally Cizek acid metabolism seems to

1049
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:27,070
play an essential role both in the

1050
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,710
acclimation as i showed you if you spray

1051
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,750
with ABA they gain hardiness but also in

1052
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:36,608
d acclamation that if you supply ABA you

1053
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:39,820
can halt so I know that was a lot but I

1054
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:41,230
will just say thank you for giving me a

1055
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,890
chance to talk and then open it up to

1056
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,889
her any questions

1057
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:57,690
I mean with prep area is there not

1058
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,550
variations out there and the natural one

1059
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:06,030
that you could actually in these cold

1060
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:07,800
winters go through and score death and

1061
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,410
essentially do a natural Association

1062
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,510
that be designed so essentially go

1063
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:15,029
through after a hard winter to figure

1064
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:17,250
out which one's died and you find 10

1065
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,519
5000 them look like I could go through

1066
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:23,309
woods and just then just gia type live

1067
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,940
and hit was that yes so the question was

1068
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:25,889
Google

1069
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,079
yes so the question was could we

1070
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:31,019
basically do a natural selection study

1071
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,940
collect impassive of very variable

1072
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,800
genotypes for ripe area plant them all

1073
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,320
out hopefully kill a good chunk of them

1074
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,289
and then just look for the genetic

1075
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,289
regions that are shared sure you walk in

1076
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:50,039
the woods can you score the desert area

1077
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:51,630
in the woods not easily and the the

1078
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,670
problem we see with the ripe areas so

1079
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,619
all of those right periods survive here

1080
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,079
whether they come from Texas where they

1081
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,359
come from Manitoba they survive here so

1082
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,549
we and I showed you in the very cold

1083
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,430
year we can start pushing things that

1084
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:08,519
are cold hardy apart your study design

1085
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:11,009
might work better if you were to take a

1086
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,920
whole diversity panel and put it in

1087
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:16,290
Manitoba right where we where we really

1088
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,920
push up against the adaptive barrier at

1089
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,989
45 degrees or the 40 degrees C line we

1090
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,260
need that kind of winter the kind of

1091
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:26,789
winters we have just make things messy

1092
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:30,840
we don't we don't normally see any

1093
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:32,699
damage in ripe area we will see it in

1094
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,100
vinifera but again it depends on the

1095
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:38,009
year in some years we have significant

1096
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,719
benefit damage at what would be

1097
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,700
considered warm temperatures because it

1098
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,099
was a very mild winter and so it's just

1099
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,839
it's really sticky but I think you could

1100
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:51,230
do it a principle if you put it

1101
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,230
someplace where you pushed yeah

1102
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:58,590
thanks a lot so in genomic prediction

1103
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,800
people are trying to integrate progress

1104
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:05,100
models with creation for things like

1105
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,350
yields and you know it depends on having

1106
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,259
a very simplified crop growth model so

1107
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:12,389
you only have a few parameters that you

1108
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,790
think are under genetic control and then

1109
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:18,420
you you push those through crop growth

1110
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:20,099
model and I mean I guess you showed me

1111
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,720
showed the various graphs where you're

1112
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:25,250
trying to match exclamation that

1113
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:28,109
Commission estimates you're developing a

1114
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:31,500
winter parting this model is it's three

1115
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:33,180
year different phases I mean you think

1116
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,360
you can simplify it or is it already

1117
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:40,619
slide down two three four maybe five

1118
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:43,650
parameters that each each you and you

1119
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:46,650
essentially try to give each genotype

1120
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,960
that you have in succession a value for

1121
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,570
you know three or four parameters and

1122
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,179
then appreciating that model so that's

1123
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,710
the goal so the the way the Keller model

1124
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:57,509
was developed is similar to what you're

1125
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,550
saying and that for each cultivar you

1126
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,500
have a set of parameters that you just

1127
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,840
plug and chug given your weather data

1128
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,400
like you just send it through with the

1129
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,590
data that I presented that's only we

1130
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,410
only have it for two varieties and this

1131
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,590
is stuff that's come out of Al's project

1132
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:14,969
but that's the end goal so it's and it's

1133
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,250
connecting those two pieces right

1134
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:19,919
because we have temperature playing a

1135
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:22,110
different role in each section and it's

1136
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,369
all related to the chill accumulation so

1137
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,970
the hope would be that we'd be able to

1138
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,739
have like a parameter that ties to

1139
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,779
acclamation a parameter that is

1140
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:33,119
measuring the chill accumulation which

1141
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,820
is fairly standard it's the temperature

1142
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,259
range and then the the rates of D

1143
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,050
acclamation so if you string those

1144
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,930
together you should get the curve based

1145
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,330
on any given year right it's going to be

1146
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:48,179
dependent on temperature so we're

1147
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:50,250
working towards that now that we know

1148
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:52,169
that it works and it's worth the effort

1149
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,309
it's actually a fairly simple experiment

1150
00:44:52,170 --> 00:45:02,789
to go out and do and collect all the

1151
00:44:53,309 --> 00:45:05,070
material and then just 43 you know with

1152
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,818
the important part is to do the growth

1153
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,130
chamber experiments

1154
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:09,599
in both cases because the natural

1155
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,039
variation there's too much other stuff

1156
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,170
going on there and I didn't show here

1157
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,759
there's other aspects of like when the

1158
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,608
Sun is out the buds are actually warmer

1159
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:20,009
than air temperature at night the butts

1160
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:21,358
drop a low air temperature so there's

1161
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:24,778
all these other environmental parameters

1162
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:27,239
that we need to narrow things in the

1163
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:28,858
growth chamber in order to understand

1164
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,528
how to incorporate them for the field so

1165
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:32,969
for the for the ripe area stuff we

1166
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,798
haven't done the controlled like d

1167
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,619
acclamation studies at different

1168
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,880
temperatures to get the rates for every

1169
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,940
every variety we only have it for that

1170
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,930
one that I showed him that that graph

1171
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,239
but that's where we're gonna go next

1172
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:48,118
because all the stuff I started with was

1173
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,548
using these older cold hardiness curves

1174
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,739
and and budburst assays and and frankly

1175
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:55,170
the new methods are a lot a lot tighter

1176
00:45:52,739 --> 00:46:00,358
and so we're gonna redo that so that we

1177
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:18,440
can actually use those parameters I'm

1178
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:20,940
sorry one more Ben you very slow speeds

1179
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,239
is there anything that has those two

1180
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:28,559
combinations I really hope so

1181
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:30,358
the acclamation side of things from from

1182
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,239
the comparisons I've done for past stuff

1183
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,429
they look like they acclimate roughly at

1184
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,088
the same rate so it may be that there's

1185
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:40,768
more of a it's a more constant response

1186
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,358
to temperature on that side of it that

1187
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:44,608
part of the physiology may be more

1188
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,179
standard in the D acclimation maybe the

1189
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:47,179
wiggly part

1190
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:52,409
rapid acclamation right now we're faced

1191
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,059
with trying to figure out how

1192
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,949
temperature with certain amplitude gives

1193
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:58,660
you certain hardiness and that actually

1194
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,980
gets tricky because as you go down and

1195
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:03,548
temperature gets harder and harder to

1196
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,289
actually simulate that winter so I don't

1197
00:47:03,548 --> 00:47:09,099
know how far we'll get to figuring out

1198
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:12,099
if we can get rapid acclimate errs but

1199
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:16,298
the hope would be get something that

1200
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:18,130
goes down and each year gets you your

1201
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:20,498
maximum hardiness so that means going to

1202
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,720
sleep early and then your maximum

1203
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:26,469
resistance to D acclamation I think that

1204
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,399
would be the the best way forward

1205
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,959
because we're not gonna be able to

1206
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,160
control winters and every now and then

1207
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,989
we're gonna have a winter that kills

1208
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:34,058
them because it's mild and then we get a

1209
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:35,588
polar vortex I don't really think

1210
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,230
there's anything we can do to prevent

1211
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:40,509
that so we just give you the best tools

1212
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:56,800
for each year

1213
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:58,829
and you had a question nobody has done a

1214
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,079
good job of showing that that's possible

1215
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:04,210
so the rootstock could impact cold

1216
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,630
hardiness from maybe some other ways by

1217
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:10,320
controlling buying bigger or by

1218
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:12,460
controlling sort of like the crop load

1219
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,869
contributing to a greater or lesser crop

1220
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,608
load and that may have a source sync

1221
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:19,588
relationship with with bud cold

1222
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:21,880
hardiness Tim Martinson is the extension

1223
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:24,480
viticulturist at Cornell and G is doing

1224
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,329
a study right now with the idea of

1225
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,409
testing the source sync idea if you

1226
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:31,150
dramatically reduce sinks or you

1227
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:34,629
dramatically reduce sources can you

1228
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:37,450
influence bud cold hardiness I don't

1229
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,940
like no one has shown that a given root

1230
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:44,799
stock will improve the cold hardiness of

1231
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:47,559
Riesling by X and really I don't know if

1232
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,710
that's possible I've never done it but

1233
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:53,619
the but itself is sort of isolated from

1234
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,900
the root part of the dormancy process

1235
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:58,180
and the hardiness process is sealing

1236
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,338
itself off from the cane so that ice

1237
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:02,139
can't propagate into the bud and so

1238
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:03,969
signals and that kind of stuff that

1239
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:07,379
might be coming from the root are going

1240
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:11,529
to be difficult to transmit into the bud

1241
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,210
outside of the growing season but yeah

1242
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:22,420
just know once I've done good systematic

1243
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:25,480
job of it first one to start winning the

1244
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:28,150
race yeah but me and you you you start

1245
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:35,559
to activate voice earlier is there a

1246
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:37,240
relationship to say that right and that

1247
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,380
was with ripe area data right so we

1248
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:44,469
haven't we would have to look to see

1249
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:45,460
what the projected dormancy target would

1250
00:49:44,469 --> 00:49:46,809
be for a Bennifer

1251
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,920
to see how close that would push up

1252
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:49,920
against harvest date

1253
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,599
so with right period we're not we have

1254
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:54,490
never eat we don't even look at yield

1255
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,490
because we just don't we're looking at

1256
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:59,108
it more from the hardness point of view

1257
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:01,118
when they do the studies with ABA and

1258
00:49:59,108 --> 00:50:03,068
they sprayed they spray the vines at

1259
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,588
brazen which is the when the berry start

1260
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:08,460
to turn purple it's sort of midseason I

1261
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:12,429
guess they see the effect in the fall

1262
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:15,730
with yellowing of leaves early leaf drop

1263
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:18,489
early entrance into dormancy but it also

1264
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,829
ripens the berries faster so the ABA

1265
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:24,399
ripens the berries faster so may be

1266
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:26,559
possible to select for yields like

1267
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:38,380
earlier ripening phenotype in tandem

1268
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:41,559
with oh okay but no you know related

1269
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:44,769
things that are gonna go into growth the

1270
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:47,619
next year okay yeah so your question is

1271
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:50,368
would would speeding up entrance into

1272
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:53,588
dormancy impact the subsequent year's

1273
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:56,650
harvest um

1274
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:58,630
I don't know how much I guess that's a

1275
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,680
great question I don't know the right

1276
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:04,150
answer I guess we would talk to like a

1277
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,190
fruit load physiologist right I don't

1278
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:10,180
know how much those late season leaves

1279
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:11,679
are contributing to the photosynthate

1280
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:14,129
storage where if you were to knock him

1281
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,268
off a couple weeks early if you would I

1282
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,769
don't think he would impact

1283
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:20,459
inflorescence number because they're

1284
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:22,019
already patterned in the buds

1285
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,349
so I don't I don't know the right answer

1286
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:38,099
to that once we figure out the first

1287
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:39,900
part and we'll go after that this has

1288
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:45,619
been a production of Cornell University

1289
