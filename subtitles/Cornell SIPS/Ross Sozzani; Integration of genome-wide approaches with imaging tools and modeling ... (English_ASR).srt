1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is the production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,730
okay so it's a great pleasure today to

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,368
introduce Ross ouazzani rods did her

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,109
graduate work in Italy and then was a

6
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:20,089
postdoc with Philip benfey and that's

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,719
when I met her and she did this absolute

8
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:24,740
beautiful work looking at how

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,509
developmental regulation interacts with

10
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,789
a cell cycle looking at the downstream

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,980
jean mec network of short route and

12
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,799
scarecrow in the cortex endodermal

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,350
initial division and found cyclin d 61

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,909
is downstream of that so it's absolutely

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,859
beautiful and i have been very

16
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:43,009
interested in how cell cycle interacts

17
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,750
with self identity so I loved her work

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,670
when I got that and we've been friends

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,009
ever since we met at several conferences

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,109
and rahxephon these people who is always

21
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,849
doing something innovative so I always

22
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,039
love hearing what her latest thing is

23
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,230
she's got a beautiful publication in the

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
Elife with a new microscopy method to

25
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,879
look at protein movement she was telling

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,759
you last night about a contraption she

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,399
and a collaborator rebuilding to image

28
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:10,909
multiple routes simultaneously with live

29
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:13,429
imaging and she does beautiful gene

30
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,659
regulatory network about occupational

31
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:20,269
analysis she's also teaching a joint

32
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,240
class with the engineering it was an

33
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:25,608
engineer on computational biology at

34
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,408
North Carolina State University so

35
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,938
welcome Roz and i'm looking for at your

36
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:33,130
talk thank you thank you everyone for

37
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:37,068
having me here mr. our friendship goes

38
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:38,810
back when we were both interviewing for

39
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,810
a job at the same time and I always

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,019
cheered for her to get the best offer

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,929
because she's in the standing scientists

42
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:51,828
an amazing person so you're so lucky to

43
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:55,939
have her here that I'm trying to get her

44
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:58,578
to the house of the triangle area but so

45
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:01,328
today what I really like to do is to

46
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:05,408
defend a couple of minutes and to set up

47
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:07,779
why I'm working with plans in a broader

48
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:11,510
topic and then I'm going to tell you

49
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:15,140
three different stories segments get try

50
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:16,939
to always tell unpublished story but

51
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:20,799
things don't develop this fast so I

52
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,810
spend most of the time talking about

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,930
published story and the other two they

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,969
were just recently published in your

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,980
life and developmental biology so they

56
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,109
will be short and I apologize that

57
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:37,319
they're already published but maybe you

58
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:42,490
haven't yet seen and I would say just

59
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:45,840
let's get these stock very informal so

60
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,330
just ask me any question that you want

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,909
during the talk and now towards the end

62
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,969
I might be to change the speed of my

63
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:57,039
talk and need so that everybody is on

64
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:59,590
board and again it will be about three

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,109
story so I stay away for the story

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,060
you're most interested in and I have an

67
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,700
outline telling you when you can go to

68
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,080
sleep and when you can wake up or etc

69
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:15,879
and with that I'll take on thanks again

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,590
Adrian to having me here and so my

71
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:22,810
interesting is really to widen to find

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,390
other people these identifying for me

73
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,170
but pursuing some of the grand

74
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:31,958
challenges of our century and so what

75
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,599
are these grand challenges join our

76
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,909
economy everybody wants our economy to

77
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,060
get better improving our health of

78
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,590
course protecting our environment and in

79
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,900
reaching our youth we are at the

80
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,379
University so we are all agree with

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,069
these four great challenges and so when

82
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:54,750
I am here why plant biology well there

83
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:58,389
is a fifth and I would say very

84
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:03,759
important activities feeding our world

85
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:07,750
and for the graduate student in here at

86
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:11,289
the talk they is extremely important how

87
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,979
you really position yourself in this

88
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:18,969
group of amazing scientists and trying

89
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:23,980
to communicate to your parents the

90
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:29,520
public what is the need why we need more

91
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:33,069
food we are a very growing population by

92
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,259
2050 we're going to grow up to 9 billion

93
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:38,659
people

94
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:41,269
the Buddha agricultural organization

95
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,750
tell us that we need to increase food

96
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:48,109
production by seventy percent if we want

97
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,259
to feed the world population and so the

98
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,569
very first things that one would say is

99
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:57,459
well i'll just plan more cops but the

100
00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:01,519
problem is that another let's say

101
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:05,149
statistical carry net is that the arable

102
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:08,479
land is declining and i always joke that

103
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:11,899
by i work on our obnoxious is a model

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,870
plant by 2050 will only see on the

105
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:17,859
sidewalk a rabid oxy splint and there

106
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,750
will be not much arable land and so

107
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,699
still when I'm talking to my mother I

108
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,449
say well we need to provide more food

109
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,889
the arable land is decreasing she would

110
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:34,370
say well when I was a kid let's say when

111
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,099
I was a teenager she said we would put a

112
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,899
lot of fertilizer so that even if you

113
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:44,360
have a smaller length you have a lot of

114
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:47,779
crop and so we all know from the first

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,120
green revolution that that was great but

116
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:52,309
we know that now fertilizer are starting

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,879
to harm the environment so now we remain

118
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,240
with these great ring challenge that we

119
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,300
need more food we have less land and we

120
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,819
want to provide enough food without army

121
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,389
the environment so how are we going to

122
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,069
do that and so I like this date and I

123
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,039
just stole my head of the department

124
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,680
that I probably retire 2050 when I say

125
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,010
well I did anything I could up to that

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,959
point to at least feed the little bit

127
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:26,469
more people but as a beginning what

128
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,449
you're going to see for me is all

129
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,820
research done on a model system hoping

130
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,069
that all the research and efforts we're

131
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,430
putting our model system will actually

132
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,800
be then eventually translated and you

133
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,319
don't need these it was not meant to be

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,370
there but that's okay and so focus on

135
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:51,560
the need feed more people basic a pro

136
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:55,709
coach is we are trying to re-engineer

137
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,668
stem cell regulations our basic idea

138
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:01,259
very grounded to the floor I always do

139
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:05,240
they say I'm very short so I'm very

140
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:09,810
close to the ground so my idea is very

141
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:14,220
grounded base if stem cell give rise to

142
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,978
all the tissue and organ of a plant well

143
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,910
if we learn more about stem cell

144
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:24,418
regulation can we actually modify the

145
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,260
architecture of a plant from the ground

146
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:32,159
so the idea here is to use everything

147
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:35,659
that we can gain from these model plant

148
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,789
arabidopsis and then eventually

149
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:44,039
translate that to none on a rabid oxys

150
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:48,719
plants and even to our flower cells as

151
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:52,110
exemplified by the vitruvian man so here

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,599
is the talk for which you can stay awake

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,639
so you can select leave this is all

154
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,879
unpublished data where I'm going to show

155
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,079
you how we are going to we obtain stem

156
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:07,829
cell type transcriptional profile of

157
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,259
jeans and then we kind of like head to

158
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:13,379
gain more information about these we

159
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:16,019
started to generate a gene regulatory

160
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,209
networks of these stem cells there will

161
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:21,810
be a little bit from the computational

162
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:25,138
side and then if you're interested then

163
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:29,668
in mewling vivo imaging where you can

164
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:32,549
obtain information about movement of

165
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:34,199
protein or for example in vivo

166
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,750
protein-protein interaction where you

167
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,250
can get down to the sewage geometry of

168
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,349
protein interaction then I'll wake you

169
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,570
up and tell you about this story and

170
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:51,209
then the third one will be to let's say

171
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:56,060
make the life of gratitude and postdocs

172
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:59,549
better so where we are trying to develop

173
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:01,049
imaging technique or at least imaging

174
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:04,079
device the ruling

175
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:07,199
crees di troops and so I had a wonderful

176
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,170
soft with Miguel saying how I to put is

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,269
actually very important even if you need

178
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:18,689
to sacrifice on something else and so

179
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:25,610
for the whole three section of the talk

180
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:29,490
the main role is going to be played by

181
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:35,220
not only a rabid absence but the root of

182
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:37,500
arabidopsis and mainly is why we're

183
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,060
reusing a rabid absolute is an extremely

184
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:46,649
flexible system e allows you to do a lot

185
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:49,588
of cool things the toolbox in terms of

186
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,259
molecular biology they are fantastic for

187
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,990
all our colleagues and friends have

188
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,809
words words set but especially for the

189
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:03,180
the sock I would like you to remember to

190
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:05,939
or just wanna the stem cells that we are

191
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:08,250
going to talk today are found at the tip

192
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,680
of the root and all the cells derived

193
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,620
from Division asymmetric cell division

194
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:17,309
of these stem cells and so when a

195
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,339
daughter cells is derived and then

196
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:23,250
another cell is divided then the cells

197
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:27,060
are pushed upwards such way that you can

198
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,610
follow time along the longitudinal axis

199
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:33,528
so we have a developmental time along

200
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:36,649
the route and then what we have is that

201
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:39,539
the root is they can give you as a

202
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:42,659
concentric cylinder and so you can

203
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:45,360
reduce a 3d space into a 2d space

204
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,759
because all these cells are radially

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,259
symmetric with the exception of the

206
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,870
basket but we're not going to go into

207
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:56,269
the details so we can follow time and

208
00:10:51,870 --> 00:11:00,120
space and so when you can deal with

209
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:03,360
spacious and portal information the best

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,589
tool you could use for me at least was

211
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:12,539
to use the root and so going into right

212
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:14,320
away the talk so we were fortunate

213
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,509
enough that we were

214
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,100
able to collect all the different stem

215
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:24,610
cell marker of the root some we develop

216
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,730
some were from talking with two leagues

217
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,100
and say oh we are trying to get all the

218
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,279
sensor market and these phenomenal

219
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,519
colleagues are just sharing all their

220
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,529
markers even before publication for

221
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,840
great collaboration so we have all these

222
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,759
different fluorescent marker of the

223
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,050
different themselves what we can do what

224
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:50,259
we can obtain stem cells Pacific

225
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:54,669
transcriptomics profile but and so that

226
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,350
we can identify stem cell gene how we do

227
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:59,019
that I'm not going to go too much into

228
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:04,090
the details but we use fluorescence

229
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:07,120
imaging so sorting so we can obtain we

230
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,000
can protoplast these plants we obtain to

231
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,590
population of cells non fluorescent

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,870
protein and fluorescent protein so that

233
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,550
we have an enriched population of the

234
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,159
different stem cell and then we can do

235
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:24,579
RNA 60 everybody so far following great

236
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:27,669
so with these data what we did well this

237
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:31,480
first point I had to sit down and say

238
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:35,559
well as cool is it that we want to work

239
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,950
on stem cell we never really show and

240
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,339
there were no data whatsoever that the

241
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,720
stem cell were actually

242
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,680
transcriptionally different from

243
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,800
nonsense oh ok so we had to do that at

244
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:55,569
first we had to look at our stem cell

245
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:58,719
and then we said well are those defense

246
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:02,110
themselves transcriptionally set apart

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,620
from non stem cell and so we had data

248
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,570
traffic comic data from let's say Stage

249
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,429
one that contains all the stem cell and

250
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,800
trans amplifying zone where cell divides

251
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,289
very often and then we have a stage to

252
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,789
that contain a long gating cells and

253
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:23,269
stage three that will contain

254
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:27,169
differentiated cell and so

255
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:30,110
from these principal components analysis

256
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:32,149
so the first point that I want to make

257
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,529
here is a joke when the very first time

258
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:39,590
I saw these CCA this is the work of my

259
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:41,240
postdoc angels she is analytic and

260
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,720
computer engineers should never work

261
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,850
with the biologists before and when I

262
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,230
saw that I said wait a second we're

263
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,080
working around be doctors not on

264
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,230
Drosophila embryo what is going on here

265
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,170
and you said no no no I rhenium is on

266
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,950
the right track what you're seeing here

267
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:05,870
is gene and how they are different from

268
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:08,300
themselves so if you I always take the

269
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,539
second and actually asking God is good

270
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:15,799
and if he sees what is the difference do

271
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:17,240
we have a volunteer here well guided to

272
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,490
that are going to have lunch with me

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,919
right so they're going to have a free

274
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,840
lunch let's make it less of a free who

275
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,569
is the graduate student they want to

276
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,200
take the lead and see if you see beside

277
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,440
the Drosophila embryo if you see any

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,330
difference if you see that the stem cell

279
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,480
have a different restriction or profile

280
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:40,970
that denounced themselves where are the

281
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:47,570
guy who Susan raise your hand but now i

282
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:48,980
need to PQ only two they're hiding what

283
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,620
is it that you're gonna have lunch with

284
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,920
me I'm going to see you in 30 meters

285
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:59,360
okay you you kept your hand enough that

286
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:02,659
you think go ahead beauty in places more

287
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,600
mature cells are further along the right

288
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:09,159
side of the principal component largely

289
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,310
mm-hmm exactly 3d aspect evidence

290
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:16,129
community right so vegas points you're

291
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:18,379
having add extra slice of pizza a

292
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:21,200
successful ganda because you deserve

293
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:26,259
this so there was actually very nice

294
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,550
because we saw that yes stem cell were

295
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:32,539
transcriptionally different than non

296
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:34,949
stem cell what we realize is that stage

297
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:37,429
one that contains some of the

298
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,110
stem cells couldn't use for any farther

299
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:44,250
analogies because we have the stage one

300
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,980
is as we expected close to the central

301
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,669
and the non stem cell so that was a

302
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,920
papers positive results and when you're

303
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:54,689
starting your lab and you say well am I

304
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,809
going the right direction I said they

305
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,970
seem so yes if we are just looking at

306
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,379
the stem cell type-specific expression

307
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,629
we're going the right direction because

308
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,509
we need their different from non stem

309
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:11,039
cells and so with that in mind we

310
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:20,629
identify that are specific for the stem

311
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:25,679
cell only 100 sorry 1,600 genes of which

312
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:27,620
200 word transcription factors and so we

313
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,689
know exactly where all these different

314
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,919
genes are expressing which stem cell and

315
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,170
etc and so with that in mind then you

316
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,750
could do a thousand six hundred genes

317
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:42,929
Willy or 200 transcription factor you

318
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,539
say 200 we can do reverse engineer we

319
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,859
can order to undergo Caroline and good

320
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,379
luck to the graduate students and

321
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:56,039
postdocs working with all these excuses

322
00:16:49,379 --> 00:17:00,330
right or we could strategize differently

323
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:03,809
and then we sat down with my postdoc and

324
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,640
say well given a lot of information and

325
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:11,879
i'm going to give you in a second can we

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:14,790
actually find a way then we ranked one

327
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,890
of these a thousand six hundred gene or

328
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,369
these two hundred transcription factors

329
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:24,180
will most likely have a major role in

330
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:27,389
stem cell functions and so we sat down

331
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,310
and we develop a computational pipeline

332
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,140
and i'm going to go into the details in

333
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,419
a second but i wanted to tell you that

334
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,420
is a joke that I'm gonna steal from

335
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,360
somebody else's I just heard when you

336
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,910
have a computational pipeline you really

337
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,579
want to show every single need agree d

338
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,590
details you'd like when you have picture

339
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:48,490
of your child and you want to show all

340
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:52,149
the feature of your child to your

341
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,308
friends they don't care much so I'm

342
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,890
going to give you just a brief overview

343
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:59,289
of this competition but line but I'm

344
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:03,040
happy to give you any extra details

345
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:06,819
their unit so the computational pipeline

346
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,909
is based on two major asset so is taking

347
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:12,419
advantage of spatial temporal data and

348
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,450
so what are these facials in portal data

349
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,120
spatial is all the different stem cell

350
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,980
markers transcriptomics profile so cell

351
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,250
type-specific don't see Tommy profile

352
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:27,779
and temporal data as I was telling you

353
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:32,529
the root as in Babs in the longitudinal

354
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:36,089
axis time so the temporal data is of the

355
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:39,009
gene expression at every single

356
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:42,250
developmental time of dude so we had a

357
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:47,890
beautiful data set already available

358
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:50,829
from Siobhan Brady showing dividing up

359
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,370
the routine a 12 section that so we

360
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:56,740
consider that a 12-time point data set

361
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:00,459
and so the computational pipeline as the

362
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,279
vapors are clustering Stephanie's normal

363
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,850
classic said that everybody may want to

364
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:12,099
use it mainly based on gene coexpression

365
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:16,178
the main assumption of it is that if a

366
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:19,779
gene is expressed in one specific stem

367
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:23,350
cells and edgy should function index 10

368
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:25,750
cell so they're practically dividing up

369
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:28,359
the gene if they're especially specific

370
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:32,650
to one stem cell or two to three some

371
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:35,699
tile and etc and then the novel aspect

372
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:39,280
of this computational pipeline is a

373
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:44,400
dynamic vision a source inference and is

374
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:49,899
the basic concept the idea here is that

375
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,450
if you find if you have a regulator you

376
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:57,910
expected this regulator is controlling a

377
00:19:52,450 --> 00:20:00,669
gene either in the time point of the

378
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,230
same time point or one point point after

379
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:07,660
and so is

380
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:10,450
is on a first assumption of Markov where

381
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,960
we saying well given the expression in

382
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,390
time-lapse 0 and 10 laps one what is the

383
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,789
probability that these gene is

384
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:22,210
regulating these allergy and so you do

385
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,839
these inference throughout the 12 data

386
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,769
point and then the other aspect that you

387
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:32,889
can have is that you can see if there is

388
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:35,980
a directionality of regulation so it is

389
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:40,660
up regulating one gene at the time lapse

390
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:45,279
one orifice down-regulate ok oh and

391
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:48,700
those are steps of the network is the

392
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:52,019
idea here was to look at inter-cluster

393
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:55,298
connection so first of all considering

394
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,849
just last word guitar for specific stem

395
00:20:55,298 --> 00:21:00,129
cells so that you will look at the

396
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,308
network of genes that function just for

397
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,500
the stem cell and also in third classes

398
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,879
so that they function you want

399
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,710
themselves but they also have a

400
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,890
connection with another central because

401
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,929
all of these are multicellular organism

402
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,169
and we know this series cell to cell

403
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:19,630
communication and then you're going to

404
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:22,120
see in a little bit the resulting

405
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,160
network but before showing you the

406
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:27,250
resulting network you say oh this is all

407
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:32,320
look good but how can you actually prove

408
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:35,890
the disease solid and reliable and etc

409
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:39,730
so computationally we need to do a

410
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:42,009
couple of step before we can say we are

411
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,019
confident about our and furniture

412
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:46,869
because we still based on probability

413
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:50,529
right and so the next two steps are how

414
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:54,428
we validated in silico practically our

415
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:56,710
new algorithm so our new algorithm is

416
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:59,620
the name is Jeanne and you can have a

417
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,269
better name we still have the chance to

418
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:05,789
change it I really don't like it but

419
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:08,829
didn't friends for gene expression

420
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:12,940
network inference from spatial temporal

421
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:15,529
data horrible name but there's no way

422
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:20,990
that we can find a better acronym but

423
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:23,779
I when we were extremely pleased is when

424
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,390
you have a new algorithm generally you

425
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,509
challenge your algorithm through a dream

426
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,420
for now there is a dream 5 competition

427
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:36,470
where you have other existing algorithm

428
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,150
existing data sets that they are

429
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,120
challenged one against each other and

430
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:44,810
then you can choose specific matrix for

431
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:47,589
example precision area under the ROC and

432
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,970
then practically these are indirect

433
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:53,689
measurement of the ratio of true

434
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,720
positives and false positive and geney's

435
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,880
always perform best and especially the

436
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,549
important access here is if you have a

437
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,940
node of 100 node or a little bit that

438
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:10,700
100 notes they tell us that will have

439
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,350
very low false positives so that our

440
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,000
graduate student imposed off we'll be

441
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:20,839
happy to go after jeans because they're

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,440
not going to quote unquote waste their

443
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:27,679
time and the other aspect though that is

444
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:32,860
currently limitation and we are working

445
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:37,580
on it it gives us confidence if we model

446
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:40,009
100 200 gene networks so I told you that

447
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,679
we had a thousand three hundred genes

448
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:45,950
there were specific for the stem cell

449
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,870
and then it's not by chance but I put

450
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,210
that there are 200 transcription factors

451
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:53,719
so from now on what you're going to see

452
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,600
is the transcription factor network of

453
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,329
the stem cell because we were highly

454
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,509
confident for just modeling this wand

455
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:04,039
regime and we couldn't really model

456
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:07,609
there thousand six hundred gene but

457
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:10,399
we're working on developing different

458
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:14,149
staff so that we can deal with many more

459
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,009
genes another way that you can an

460
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,700
additional way that you should validate

461
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:22,220
new algorithm is with using in vivo data

462
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,870
for example here is an example for

463
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,920
example is an example of a known neck in

464
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,169
a

465
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,720
cell typing the roots where we have

466
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:38,720
these master regulator downstream genes

467
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:40,450
and etc and so we compare our new

468
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,610
algorithm with existing algorithms

469
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,950
mainly the one that is often uses

470
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,769
Arachne and what you can see here well

471
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,920
it performs there while I find forth

472
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:54,680
through positive one post- mainly

473
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,840
because there is a regulation back of

474
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,750
these transcription factors but what I

475
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,669
would like you to see here is the

476
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,019
difference between two pen these two

477
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:09,740
panels that our new algorithm what it

478
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:12,079
can do it can find the directionality as

479
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,240
i was telling you so this arrow will

480
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,750
actually tell you who is regulating who

481
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,000
and the sign of the regulation it is an

482
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,009
activator or oppression and the other

483
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,910
thing that you can clearly see is the

484
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:29,480
different size of these nodes so we use

485
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:32,540
the matrix that tells you the importance

486
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:37,390
of the different transcription factor

487
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,389
based on some otha Jesus they could be

488
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:46,849
outgoing edges so outgoing regulation it

489
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:50,029
could be on in how many people will loop

490
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:53,089
these genies involved how many feedback

491
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:56,210
loop how many by fan look so you look at

492
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:59,240
the network topology and based on the

493
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,910
left with apology you can infer a

494
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,519
ranking and so you can infer a size of

495
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,940
the notes so that if you were a graduate

496
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:11,389
student you will not put them much

497
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:15,559
effort into c2 but you will put much

498
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:17,870
effort into these APL gene that indeed

499
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,240
we know is a master regulator of flow in

500
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:22,729
the balance so the next thing you're

501
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,769
going to see yeah go ahead you want an

502
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:31,519
extra pieces lives I got it anyway

503
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:34,400
hungry yea big it yes not actually

504
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,389
important the edges are also different

505
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,040
sizes because we have actually weight

506
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,040
associated with it so

507
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:48,908
the point here when we cluster we do

508
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:51,519
came in clusters and we run it for ten

509
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:54,039
thousand times and so based on the

510
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,168
caning some of the G will go in one cell

511
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,259
in one cluster some of them will go in

512
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:04,380
another closet and so sometimes the

513
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:08,408
edges don't exist so what we do look we

514
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:11,820
set a threshold they say is 0.6 and then

515
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:14,470
we drop all the edges that are less

516
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:17,349
important so that we don't have that

517
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:20,470
many directions yes so it's based on the

518
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:24,609
weight and the number of how many times

519
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:28,870
these happen throughout the inference

520
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:34,678
algorithm yes babe the point XS which

521
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:41,229
that which I buy you it is really time

522
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:46,330
to go you shouldn't ok so what you have

523
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:48,548
here is the resulting network any is if

524
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:51,099
I'm proud of my daughter and proud of

525
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:53,918
this matters because it's the real very

526
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:58,329
first feature of all these transcription

527
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:03,250
factor ah for which there were 20 years

528
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:07,028
of work and what we can see is that from

529
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:11,019
these middle parts of the next words we

530
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:14,109
do really recover all and with the

531
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:17,019
dollar sign is the happy myself we all

532
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:20,558
recover genes for which in which ensures

533
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:22,839
that our data confirming their role in

534
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:27,129
stem cells specification in stem cell

535
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:29,259
maintenance route the element so what

536
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,840
these networks is showing just to make

537
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:34,658
it brief in the middle in showing all

538
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,069
the stem cells that are in all the stem

539
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,330
cells jeans if I important for the

540
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:41,829
maintenance and then on the side at the

541
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:45,509
beginning I was calling these this

542
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:48,210
spaghetti meatball disaster but then

543
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:51,548
there is a battalion and I can I guess

544
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,669
but then biologically it makes a lot of

545
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:56,579
things all of these large know

546
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,989
are important for the maintenance

547
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:03,548
specification of the stem cell and all

548
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:06,579
of these subclasses then we look into

549
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:09,069
them and we identify genes that have an

550
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:12,819
important scene for example specific

551
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:16,839
stem cell type function so what I'm

552
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:23,158
going to tell you next is that well we

553
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:26,738
took to stem cell identity network and

554
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:30,570
validated that in two different way so

555
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:32,980
the very first way was to look at the

556
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:36,329
chromatin immunoprecipitation so

557
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:41,739
protein-dna interactions of these

558
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:43,720
specific xylem stem cells so chromatin

559
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,999
immunoprecipitation using these no

560
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,129
interception faster that is actually the

561
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:51,419
transcription factor was working while I

562
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:54,548
was a postdoc and then we also look at

563
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,999
my home that's why my own gene

564
00:29:54,548 --> 00:30:01,628
expression data while I was a postdoc of

565
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:05,288
the induction of these genes and so what

566
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:08,469
we could find in these network that one

567
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:12,429
two three four five six five out of the

568
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:15,100
six bow string gene will confirm by

569
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:18,129
chromatin immunoprecipitation and by

570
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:20,648
gene expression profile we still have

571
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:24,658
one that is not confirmed but we're

572
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:28,108
working on using new molecular

573
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:31,480
techniques to see if this is a real

574
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:34,329
target or is a false positive the other

575
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,038
that I would like to spend or and these

576
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,460
panel was supposed to come up later but

577
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:42,298
that's okay is the quietest sensor

578
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:47,829
network so we were fortunate enough that

579
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:50,618
just recently marcin yep nosky have

580
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:53,199
shown an important role of these genes

581
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:56,319
transcription factor entity in the quiet

582
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,038
and sensor we had great work done on

583
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:04,778
Bravo showing function of this gene in

584
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:08,558
the platen center but they will and then

585
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:10,749
we have known player one player to play

586
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,450
there are six that we all know that I

587
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:16,169
important for you see function and then

588
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,830
we focus our attention of these genes

589
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:22,899
Tyrion SIA and what we identifies that

590
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:24,999
you can believe me but I have another

591
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:29,199
picture with the marketing side where we

592
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:31,749
see QC phenotype so the QC is these low

593
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,058
hand part is Miley part of the route

594
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:37,089
this is a little bit crooked it will

595
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:42,249
need some braces in terms of smiles it

596
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:45,038
has some crooked question Center and

597
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:46,720
will we know from many years of work is

598
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,569
they if you don't have a functional

599
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,278
active sensor the D Stokes themselves

600
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:54,999
that are the collumela stem cell they

601
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,950
differentiate and so will we obtained

602
00:31:54,999 --> 00:32:01,480
with a collaborator a fantastic

603
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:05,230
collaborator from Spain the inducible

604
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,079
line of these jeans Perry oncea what you

605
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,599
have is that you have extra call you

606
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,240
mellow stem cell and the reason while

607
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,548
I'm saying that this is a PSP I staining

608
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,128
we're in red you can see the start line

609
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:19,808
so you have during a mutant the starch

610
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:21,609
granule are really close to the quite as

611
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:23,440
incentive suggesting that there's no

612
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,388
call you mellow stem cells and here you

613
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,110
see extra layer of Colleen I love

614
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:32,469
themself and so we did ah and I'm when I

615
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:35,888
should not show you in the details we

616
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,579
did a mathematical model to predict the

617
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:42,368
function of fans but has biologists and

618
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:44,980
there's the reason why the paper is now

619
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:47,109
your house is under revision because the

620
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,798
reviewers thank you to the reviewer they

621
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:53,618
ask for more biological data what we did

622
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,898
and they is the same Newton but this

623
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:58,480
time with the question sensor market so

624
00:32:55,898 --> 00:33:02,829
you can see that it has croquettes quiet

625
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:07,450
and center we did RNA seek so we look at

626
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:10,418
the gene expression profile of these of

627
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:13,749
the gene in these mutant compared to all

628
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:17,950
types and that day I think I was close

629
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:20,769
to cry so happy I was because if I take

630
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,170
a second and I go back to all of these

631
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:26,710
stem cell leash

632
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:30,880
networks what we find is that seventy

633
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:34,059
percent of all the stem cell niche and

634
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,120
the one in the question center they're

635
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:39,579
all down regulated in these families so

636
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,069
we have there were sure root genies

637
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:45,669
downregulated all the clitoral gene are

638
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:47,649
downregulated all the other stem cells

639
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:51,039
genes are all down regulated suggesting

640
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:54,370
that our network identified amongst the

641
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:59,740
regulator for question Center function

642
00:33:54,369 --> 00:34:02,019
and stem cells maintenance extremely

643
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:06,099
happy so there was the pre first part of

644
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:09,250
the talk was I'm you excited reality

645
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:11,679
perfect because the rest of the talk

646
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,079
will be just telling you and pointing

647
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,539
you to these paper because unfortunate

648
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,610
we don't have enough data to make

649
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:23,829
another story so this very first part is

650
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,500
that we develop a gene regulatory

651
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:30,699
network inference that takes advantage

652
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:33,309
of any kind of spatial temporal data so

653
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:35,589
for example we have used now these in

654
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:41,909
collaboration with them cheap wood and

655
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:48,010
use tomato leaf development to infer

656
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:51,039
network involving leaf thickness we use

657
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:54,220
it for through berry development from

658
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:58,690
the green to bury to the red story so

659
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:02,169
anytime you have a time course and cell

660
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:05,920
type or tissue type or introgression

661
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:10,110
line data set you can combine these two

662
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,599
data sets and get useful information so

663
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:16,030
now these are going to be just 10

664
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:21,219
minutes long and then I'll be happy to

665
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:24,250
have many more questions just going back

666
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:28,480
to the initial images that I show you

667
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:30,309
the roots is a concentric cylinder what

668
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,110
I told usually begin is that all the

669
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:34,299
different stem cells give rise to all

670
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,530
the different issues through HTML South

671
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,440
Asian and

672
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:41,110
the works done while I was a postdoc in

673
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,050
philly been fees lab and that I started

674
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:50,470
while i was in Philip this is a great

675
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:54,070
collaboration we had was to study a key

676
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:56,439
aspect regarding this two important

677
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,370
transcription factor they regulate the

678
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,409
asymmetric cell division a one kind of

679
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:05,710
felt I'd that is the cortex endodermis

680
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:07,839
initial so in a short mutant you don't

681
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,970
have to remember the name but they will

682
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,890
come up they often show root just

683
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:13,569
remember that this museum was identify

684
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:18,849
had a very short short short route and

685
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,500
then Scarecrow was identified because he

686
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:23,679
also liked this asymmetric cell division

687
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:27,489
and he only had one ground tissue until

688
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:31,299
it was named after the wizard of oz they

689
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:33,909
were two other mutant teeny man and lion

690
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:37,750
they also were missing some other cell

691
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:39,369
types and this was I think Cole's k

692
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,809
occur because at that time it was

693
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,719
considered that the ground tissue was

694
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:47,019
the brain of the root correct I was not

695
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:49,179
there so I don't put my hand on fire but

696
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:51,759
remember short teeny tiny with a

697
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:53,919
scarecrow the one without the brain but

698
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,990
what we know that is not just specific

699
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,720
to this transcription factor we have now

700
00:36:55,989 --> 00:37:00,729
platter of data showing that about

701
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,099
twenty thirty percent of transcription

702
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,789
factor actually moving to keep chill

703
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:09,699
factor so they move from where they are

704
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:11,860
produced two adjacent cell layer so this

705
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:14,439
subscription factor is producing the

706
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:18,849
basket of the route that he moved to the

707
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:22,780
adjacent cell layer where activate the

708
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:25,239
downstream targets careful and then we

709
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:29,019
know that shirt and scarecrow interact

710
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:30,759
together to regulate this asymmetric

711
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:36,280
cell division of the ground tissue and

712
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:40,200
so we had a mathematical model and we

713
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,269
really never asked the question if the

714
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,969
quantification of this movement

715
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:48,139
important if we want to have a more

716
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:50,480
quantitative model and

717
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:52,279
is the stoichiometry of the protein

718
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,079
complex important you don't know until

719
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:59,860
you test that right and so we started to

720
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,219
collaborate with the sciences a

721
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:07,970
physicist that UC Irvine that he started

722
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:11,149
just back then to use fluorescent

723
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:13,489
correlation spectroscopy canning

724
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,280
fluorescent correlation spectroscopy to

725
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:18,949
obtain information about movements of

726
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,140
protein and protein-protein interaction

727
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:24,049
so I don't want to go too much into the

728
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:28,069
physics details but it's practically

729
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:30,200
when you have your sample and you're

730
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,920
looking on there for example a laser

731
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:36,019
scanning microscope a composer I know

732
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,409
you tend to just have the most beautiful

733
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:43,369
picture right but the background things

734
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:46,849
that is going on is that every time you

735
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,949
have a fluorescent protein and it goes

736
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,650
in and out your observation volume that

737
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:54,230
is your focal objective and when it

738
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:57,170
goes in and out your observation volume

739
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:59,539
what it does he emits intensity

740
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,909
fluctuations and if you follow the

741
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:05,869
intensity fluctuations over time and

742
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:07,789
over space and then you feat using an

743
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:10,639
autocorrelation function you can do

744
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:13,670
indeed obtain information about the

745
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:18,199
movement the concentration and if you do

746
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:20,930
a dual fluorescing cross correlation and

747
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:23,239
you have two fluorescent protein one

748
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:25,969
that gives an intensive fluctuation in

749
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,769
for example the GFP channel and one that

750
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:31,369
gives you intensive situation in the red

751
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:33,230
channel you can cross-correlate and fit

752
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,420
to this cross correlation function and

753
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,300
get information about the stoichiometry

754
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,639
of the protein complex so that for

755
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,570
example you don't care much if these

756
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,969
protein are close to each other so if

757
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:49,340
you will need to do protein-protein

758
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:52,129
interaction using fresh but they can

759
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,579
just be in the same protein complex even

760
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,300
if they are far apart they will feel

761
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,559
cross-correlation you will still give

762
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,660
you information about the

763
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:04,670
protein-protein interactions

764
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:10,769
ah so this cami region make a question

765
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:16,048
it depends so it depends on let's see if

766
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:18,780
I have an image here I know okay the

767
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:29,699
scanning region to go through two or

768
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:33,839
three cells so is a few microns I'm

769
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:35,909
trying to remember top of my head just

770
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,940
few Michaels because the cells in the

771
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:43,558
root are very small but you can have as

772
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,510
long as you want with no problem let me

773
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:51,109
walk you through a little bit and see if

774
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:56,579
I can get from you another question

775
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:58,679
because so the point here is that with

776
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,829
Russ image correlation spectroscopy is

777
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:05,879
that you do a scanning of a 2d frame and

778
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:07,890
we could be as big as you want the

779
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:14,160
important is that for example that the

780
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:16,710
pixel size is smaller than your point

781
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,259
spread function so that is more

782
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:23,088
informative than you can image whatever

783
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,740
you want you will just have longer

784
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:28,219
scanning but the important is that for

785
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:30,949
your point spread function at ease the

786
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:34,169
observation volume of your objective is

787
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:36,929
tendency around 300 nanometer and you

788
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:39,599
need to have at least five to six pixels

789
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:43,318
in each point spread function to have

790
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,068
enough correlation I hope did that

791
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:48,690
answer your question and so when i'm

792
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:51,989
going to present you and that we use

793
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,179
these imaging technique in the plan for

794
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:55,769
the first time is raster image

795
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,048
correlation spectroscopy and i'm going

796
00:41:55,769 --> 00:42:00,778
to go into details in a second then you

797
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:04,469
can really calculate movements and so

798
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:08,338
what I want to say here is a second and

799
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:10,889
tell you that we have to use diffusion

800
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:14,369
coefficient as a term but that doesn't

801
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:18,690
mean that your protein are diffusing

802
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:21,088
they can be actively transported it's

803
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,818
just that the physics terms is diffusion

804
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:26,460
coefficients but it can be really

805
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:28,889
actively transported as in this case and

806
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,510
then what I'm going to show you is a

807
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:35,818
line scan where we can tell really the

808
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:39,420
intra and intercellular movement of a

809
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:40,829
protein and the number and brightness so

810
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,940
these are the three techniques that i'm

811
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:45,619
going to send

812
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:49,139
nice five minutes to it where we can see

813
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:54,210
the oligomeric state of the protein at

814
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:58,549
the cellular level so the raster scan is

815
00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:02,119
really raster of your 2d image so you

816
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:06,329
trace you send your laser along the line

817
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,269
and then along the frame so that you can

818
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:11,130
image the cell type of interest or the

819
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:14,338
two different cell type of interest in

820
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:17,160
this case it will be cells that contain

821
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:20,519
the basket sure where we know the

822
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:23,098
protein is produced and then cells where

823
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,989
the protein moves to and so without

824
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:27,630
going too much into the details what we

825
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:29,338
could already see that there is a

826
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,970
differential movement of this

827
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:34,529
transcription factor in this cell type

828
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:38,279
versus these other cell type wave pools

829
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:42,329
and so we knew from previous molecular

830
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,019
data that this could be because in these

831
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:49,470
in the dermis alleys we're sure would

832
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:55,019
interact with scarecrow and so we wonder

833
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:58,439
whether the low movement of Shores was

834
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:01,980
because of scarecrow and so in this case

835
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:05,068
we really can quantify this movement and

836
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,769
insignificant and we know that it caused

837
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:10,230
an asymmetric cell division we can see

838
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:12,900
that in absence of scarecrow or in a

839
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,679
scarecrow in AI line now in game the

840
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:19,050
dermis what we have is that shirt now

841
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:22,289
moves like it will move in the basket ER

842
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:27,750
suggesting here yes indeed scarecrow is

843
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:31,318
important for the movement of shows the

844
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:35,900
other thing that we look is well what is

845
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:39,329
the movements and how scarecrow

846
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:43,280
restraints shirts movement and so they

847
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:45,150
are pcs beta where pcs is frankly

848
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,339
correlating all the intensity

849
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,139
fluctuations along a line to spend

850
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:51,480
different cells so that you can ask a

851
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:54,328
question does this protein move from

852
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,429
these cell sides to these cell types be

853
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:57,289
so kind

854
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:59,719
vice versa and if there is a

855
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:02,389
differential movement where these

856
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:06,049
differential movement is coming from and

857
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:08,929
so in order for you to actually read

858
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:11,539
through the heat maps and i'm going to

859
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:15,558
show you in a second i'm going to just

860
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:18,079
show you an example if I version so the

861
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,710
heat mac or carpet that we obtain are

862
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,589
going to be looking like that so in the

863
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:27,170
X Direction is the space in the Y

864
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,639
Direction is sign if the protein is

865
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,220
moving south yourself yourself yourself

866
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,759
in a diffusing browse in this way

867
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:36,969
without any active movement what you're

868
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,910
going to see in blue is the

869
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:45,889
representation of the movement between

870
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:50,379
cells with the diffusion if you said

871
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:53,598
don't see diffusion so if you only see

872
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:56,510
blue means correlations of movements

873
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,170
black means no movement if you see that

874
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:03,290
you only see movement here but not here

875
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:06,380
then this will be your exemplify heat

876
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:09,769
map if you said see a delaying the

877
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,480
movement so you will see a art formation

878
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,909
that tells you that is taking some time

879
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:18,349
for this protein to move from cell to

880
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:20,420
cell but eventually will move and so we

881
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:22,789
ask the question well what is the

882
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:26,088
movement of Shah route from where it's

883
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:29,088
produced to where he ends up and so what

884
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:31,239
we can see is that it moves we know that

885
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:35,199
shirtless move to plasmodesmata the

886
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:38,959
cytoplasmic collection it moves through

887
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:42,558
one cell and another through a delay

888
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,318
movement but then when we look at the

889
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:49,180
direction like the directionality of the

890
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:52,068
movement so going back to the basket ER

891
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:56,269
then cannot would correspond to the fact

892
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:58,699
that at that point sureties moving lower

893
00:46:56,269 --> 00:47:01,130
than in the vascular we can clearly see

894
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:03,199
that Colonel truth does not move back

895
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:07,250
into the boxes and so I've shown you

896
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:09,049
before that if we take away scarecrow he

897
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:13,280
moves faster

898
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:15,470
Joe root and so we look at the intra and

899
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,030
Inter cellular movement of show roots in

900
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:19,369
a scarecrow mute on the ground and

901
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:22,730
telling us what we find is that you know

902
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:28,029
scarecrow rnai line we can track that

903
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:32,119
sure is going back to the passages so

904
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:34,480
these worlds to show you that indeed we

905
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,819
can quantify the movement and really

906
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,429
give a rout of the movement of these

907
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,880
transcription factors and then we can

908
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:46,429
also look at how they interact so this

909
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:49,460
is the background you just need to

910
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:51,949
believe me here we need to calibrate

911
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:55,159
every time with the control line that is

912
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:58,819
anonymous form where for example mono

913
00:47:55,159 --> 00:48:03,469
make form are exemplified by these blue

914
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:05,150
pixels when we look at Shaw root all the

915
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:07,369
Khmer state will we see it if you

916
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,320
imagine here is the root this is the

917
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:11,839
basket always produce and leases the

918
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,450
nuclei of being the dermis where it's

919
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,600
moving what we see is that if there is a

920
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:20,199
percentage of mono make form of short

921
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,420
just in the vascular while there is a

922
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:25,969
higher oligomers state in terms of

923
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:28,970
dimers and Petra male in the in the

924
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:31,819
dermis where interacts with careful so

925
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:35,809
again we ask the question if you

926
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:39,380
interact with scarecrow is the oligomer

927
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:41,750
state of sure roots affected by the

928
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,869
absence of scarecrow and so what we are

929
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:47,809
looking here is more or less the same

930
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:50,150
orientation we can clearly see that in

931
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:52,610
the nucleus being the dermis we're now

932
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:56,660
scarecrow is no longer there surely is

933
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:58,460
just as a monomer and so that's how I

934
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:00,699
asked the Scarecrow is practically a

935
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:04,309
bridge bringing together too short

936
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:06,919
protein and so what we did with took an

937
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:09,769
additional step and look at the cross

938
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,869
correlation so we label shoulders with

939
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:13,460
the GSP we label scarecrow with the n

940
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:17,329
cherry you can clearly see where they

941
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,409
are expressed shows scarecrow usually

942
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,989
you will just look at the

943
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:22,839
co-localization and say fair enough but

944
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:25,809
what we actually went

945
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:29,769
is where they interact how they interact

946
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:33,159
so this is the correlation map where you

947
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:35,679
can qualitatively see with the blue dots

948
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:38,440
where they are interacting in a

949
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,299
stoichiometry 121 and the green dots

950
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:44,099
where they are interesting as the

951
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:47,170
geometry of two to one and here is the

952
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:50,739
stoichiometric Instagram where we can

953
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,090
see that there are mostly one shoulder

954
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:54,669
thing worse careful with red

955
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:57,940
exemplifying the highest probability to

956
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:00,250
find this conception factored in a to

957
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,590
come to 121 but also that you have a

958
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,989
high probability to find to shore route

959
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,700
with one scarecrow and here is the

960
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:09,879
quantification so everything that I show

961
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:12,189
you qualitatively we can also obtain the

962
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,950
quantification so eighty percent of

963
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,559
these is of the protein-protein

964
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:22,480
interaction is one to one and two to one

965
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:24,279
is limited to fifteen percent so what

966
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,050
I'm telling you all this story I'm

967
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,330
telling you all this story because it's

968
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,360
extremely cool to be and going to

969
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:32,799
details of identifying the movements and

970
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,920
quantify the movement and the

971
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:39,100
stoichiometry but the idea we had was to

972
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,110
obtain these information and develop a

973
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:43,269
mathematical model they will give us

974
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,789
information about the dynamics of these

975
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:47,769
two transcription factor so this is the

976
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:50,349
mathematical model that we use is a

977
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:53,079
series of order differential equation

978
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:55,210
where we are modeling for example show

979
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:58,059
notes in the basket or shortening the

980
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:02,320
dermis and then from our data we know

981
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:04,779
that there are diamonds of sure routine

982
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:09,010
ended early so that is the equation for

983
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:11,290
that aspect and then we have the models

984
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:13,240
scarecrow and leaves the yield term

985
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:16,300
because we know the shortest regulates

986
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:18,129
vehicle and then we have the complex one

987
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,820
to one of shorts scarecrow and the

988
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,769
complex of two to one short escapes all

989
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,990
the information that I told you we

990
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:27,610
practically retranslate in a

991
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:29,139
mathematical model it's like you will

992
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,510
translate from the English to the

993
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:35,529
Italian all of these is what I just told

994
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,310
you from the biology to the mathematical

995
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,690
model

996
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:43,059
we ran up sensitivity analysis and find

997
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:45,730
out that diffusion coefficient were

998
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:47,679
extremely important but let me tell you

999
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:52,929
what the model tell us and how we

1000
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:55,389
validate it so what these first outcome

1001
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:57,549
simulation of the model tells you is

1002
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:59,199
that we don't know anything about sure

1003
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,600
to show these produce and it stays

1004
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,480
constant we can do much about that until

1005
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:08,619
we identify upstream regulator short in

1006
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,019
the red line is the expression of

1007
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:15,579
scarecrow over time and what you can see

1008
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:17,500
that about 2.5 three hour is when you

1009
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:20,139
reach the highest expression of

1010
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:22,210
scarecrow and that what you can learn

1011
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:26,650
here that as soon as taker is produced

1012
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:30,000
is the requester by Shaw root and you

1013
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:34,440
have the formation of a shirt scarecrow

1014
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,869
121 protein complex only with time

1015
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:41,349
taking place at about nine hour we start

1016
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:43,839
to see that the two-two-one scarecrow

1017
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:47,409
short complex takes place and so what we

1018
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,480
did we practically validated this

1019
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:51,399
mathematical model by using a short

1020
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,190
inducible system where we put a

1021
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,950
scarecrow transcription online and what

1022
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:59,349
we can see that after we use show roots

1023
00:52:56,949 --> 00:53:01,869
to like will do the mathematical model

1024
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:04,269
the simulation here as soon as we use

1025
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:06,460
shirts at about three hour we start to

1026
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:10,659
see scary expression and that will fit

1027
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:13,809
that very well the other things that we

1028
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:18,399
are now working on is that you can see

1029
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:20,980
that all the solution reaches of steady

1030
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,880
state so they reach a plateau what that

1031
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:27,579
means well we know that about 16 to 18

1032
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,640
to 24 hours when the stem cells start to

1033
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:33,759
divide but we really didn't have any way

1034
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:37,420
to track and follow stem cell division

1035
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,760
over time so these still remain the part

1036
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:44,260
that we're working on and understand

1037
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,660
these second outcome of the model and so

1038
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:50,070
the second part of the talk and the next

1039
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:52,500
one out the glance through is okay

1040
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,900
is really that scanning pressing

1041
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,170
correlation spectroscopy allow you to

1042
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:02,099
quantify parameters that were not there

1043
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:04,710
easy to quantify before and then all of

1044
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,839
these quantitative measurements they can

1045
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:10,769
really be put into a mathematical model

1046
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:16,019
that is able to tell you what are the

1047
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:18,119
dynamic of your system and so these that

1048
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,920
in this talk I'm telling you it was a

1049
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,159
natural progression well we started to

1050
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,159
use these before we got these data is to

1051
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:29,190
develop new technology to do long time

1052
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,319
course and so the long time course that

1053
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,900
I'm talking about is to using a life

1054
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,740
sheet microscopy where I'm going to just

1055
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:41,160
tell you not the advantages but the

1056
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:44,219
limitation that we had to overcome so we

1057
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,319
did seize them you can grow one sample

1058
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:48,629
that aside and as I was telling you you

1059
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,970
need to get high throughput to get your

1060
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,519
gardener and pulls off happy so we

1061
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:56,759
wanted to if you want to do a five days

1062
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,619
time course then you have and you want

1063
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,830
12 biological replica your graduate

1064
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:04,619
student is working for a week for the

1065
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:06,539
next 12 weeks on a single project and

1066
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:08,429
you know how it goes most of the time

1067
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:11,789
experiment fails so it's going to take

1068
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:16,649
six months so that you get one real good

1069
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:19,170
data set so what we did we collaborated

1070
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,480
with an engineer in the department of

1071
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:25,200
industrial and system engineer and with

1072
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:29,909
Tim horn and we develop a system that

1073
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:32,429
use the same exact aspects and specs of

1074
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:35,609
the life sheet microscope that we're

1075
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:38,309
using but at this time now we 3d printed

1076
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,410
an imaging chamber that we called magic

1077
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:42,210
it was really magic multisample

1078
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:45,179
arabidopsis grows an imaging chamber

1079
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:47,309
where we could imagine least four sample

1080
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:50,279
at a time rather than one so rather than

1081
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:52,529
wait 12 weeks now you get that your

1082
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,480
image one plant you rotate these

1083
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:56,220
revolving chamber you image the second

1084
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,679
plan you rotate so you have for

1085
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:01,799
biological replicates right there so you

1086
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:03,969
reduce a lot of time in the cost these

1087
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,818
things cost a lot

1088
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:10,389
and so currently we have a prototype

1089
00:56:07,818 --> 00:56:13,190
that olds more than four because we want

1090
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:17,118
to run just a couple of biological

1091
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:19,880
ratikan and I binocs statistics so we

1092
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:23,750
tried out the system using a marker for

1093
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,000
cell division and currently we use in

1094
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,889
existing pipeline in community but we

1095
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,219
are working with the lasik and computer

1096
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:33,739
engineer craniums Williams amazing

1097
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:36,739
collaborator in the field to develop our

1098
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:39,618
own automatic image pipeline to

1099
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:41,689
calculate cell division coming over

1100
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:45,740
coming over time especially for the stem

1101
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:47,990
cell we validated this is the existing

1102
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:51,709
pipeline we're happy to share is

1103
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:56,028
practically coming up from Fiji so

1104
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:59,889
extremely useful when we could be able

1105
00:56:56,028 --> 00:57:03,349
to measure was all the different new

1106
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:08,679
cell division using our system and using

1107
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:11,480
the existing system from vice and that

1108
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:14,690
you can see that along the time our

1109
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:18,679
system plans are very happy and they

1110
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:22,429
keep on dividing you want that and so we

1111
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:26,960
image more plans for more than 48 hours

1112
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:29,449
and the nice part is that now we can do

1113
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,119
a lot of experiment where we change the

1114
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:35,268
design of these chamber where we can do

1115
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:37,039
drug treatment that temperature

1116
00:57:35,268 --> 00:57:40,399
treatment because we have a temperature

1117
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:43,009
sensor and so on so forth so the end of

1118
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,108
the talk is kind of like the take home

1119
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:51,170
message different talk but all together

1120
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:53,538
our umbrella question is how can we

1121
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:56,539
really understand stem cell regulation

1122
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:58,730
so that we can manipulate them cell

1123
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:02,630
regulation and so is really the

1124
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:04,880
triangulation and work of biology

1125
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:07,670
computational biology and develop a new

1126
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,420
technique and so there was exemplified

1127
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:14,980
by modeling cell-type specific

1128
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:17,750
expression and the idea here again my

1129
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:22,369
good friend the vitruvian man

1130
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:24,949
is eventually so there are known animal

1131
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:28,480
stem cell network player can we actually

1132
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:33,679
obtain the end full plant stem cells

1133
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:35,869
genes in a rabid dogs and so this is no

1134
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,669
picture but a couple of more people were

1135
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:41,150
added to the group but this is the core

1136
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,130
group we started with worth today that

1137
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,710
i'm showing you was from the postdoc

1138

grant and a bi-lateral grant with the UK

1146
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,750
and NSF dbcs egrants and we did I take

1147
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:27,889
any question and so sorry that I ran at

1148
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:32,809
the clock I'll take any questions I know

1149
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:36,049
was a lot I hope you left a little bit

1150
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:38,299
in between oh geez / studies the first

1151
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:41,060
thing you do get your roots for the

1152
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:44,510
starry seek and you die just a syllable

1153
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:46,909
fellation sit there and make it I

1154
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:49,130
selected the photo class right whoops oh

1155
00:59:46,909 --> 00:59:51,170
you'd love the simplest you communicate

1156
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:54,140
and presumably sell their enormous

1157
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:56,630
distress so do you have an idea what

1158
00:59:54,139 --> 01:00:04,519
that does the overall story at your gene

1159
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:08,780
network non don't you see if he's a

1160
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:11,659
concern that we all keep in our best

1161
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:14,330
mine to do the protoplast thing what I

1162
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:16,399
can tell you is that all the different

1163
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:17,480
lines are treated with the same way so

1164
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,119
if there are genes that are

1165
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,150
differentially regulated by the actual

1166
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:25,819
protoplasm system they will be discarded

1167
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:29,920
because they will have the same change

1168
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,920
in expression over sample

1169
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:36,650
the other aspect is that we need to get

1170
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:40,250
some type specific expression and that

1171
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:44,480
is so far what we can do bad but yeah

1172
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:47,900
you're right we is hour and a half

1173
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:50,059
protocol for which yes a lot of gene

1174
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:53,588
will change their expression profile

1175
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:57,440
because of the stress but you should

1176
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:59,750
normalize and lose this gene and so

1177
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,240
probably we will lose some jeans but the

1178
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:04,159
point here is at least the gene that

1179
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,529
you're going to go after like for

1180
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:10,219
example the tree oncogene clearly show

1181
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:12,080
the heads of rolling the stem cell

1182
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:13,789
function yeah I mean you can file a

1183
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,400
little approach that makes a CAPTCHA to

1184
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:21,710
see Justin better for someone removal of

1185
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:23,750
people doing that so um so we are doing

1186
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,429
laser capture but for example we are

1187
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,858
doing laser caption where we cannot do

1188
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:30,500
for extra activities of Sony so we have

1189
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:32,690
a project with the popular trees where

1190
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,389
we can clearly show and follow the

1191
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,519
morphology of the stem cell for

1192
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:39,588
secondary growth and we do laser capture

1193
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:43,159
but for example for these those are very

1194
01:01:39,588 --> 01:01:49,940
teeny tiny rules and so it's not that

1195
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:51,858
easy is it not that easy yes but good

1196
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:55,369
point one could think to do in fact or

1197
01:01:51,858 --> 01:01:57,920
so on but so far we're happy will we get

1198
01:01:55,369 --> 01:02:01,550
but is is always you need to keep that

1199
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,849
in your backpack yes so does apply for

1200
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:06,830
the job or is pretty cool so after and

1201
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:09,500
early did you consider about the

1202
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:13,639
movement no such as christian factors to

1203
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:15,980
measuring the fertilizer yeah you you

1204
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:18,618
are too young point you want to come in

1205
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:21,469
my lab and work in my lab please do

1206
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:23,990
because I'm always telling my graduate

1207
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:26,689
student can we in any way from the gene

1208
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:29,689
regulatory networks in first we charge

1209
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:32,750
the genes that are actually moving or

1210
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:35,659
etc we will not be able to until we also

1211
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:39,679
have protein information but they is a

1212
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:41,598
key point these gene move around and so

1213
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,509
we should get to the point where we

1214
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,820
develop

1215
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:49,310
computational model that predicts which

1216
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,680
transcription factor movies but I think

1217
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:54,679
we need to get to the protein level and

1218
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,619
add overlay the trunk atomic and the

1219
01:02:54,679 --> 01:03:00,980
proteomics so far the limitation is that

1220
01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:03,259
with trans Khatami RNA and DNA you

1221
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:06,139
amplify you can start with very little

1222
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:08,080
material with proteomics we are not yet

1223
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:11,929
there to get cell type-specific

1224
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:14,329
proteomics profile yeah so going back to

1225
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:18,289
that question is what Jo shine so much

1226
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:20,059
on so when you do that principle

1227
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:22,340
component in that yes one of the

1228
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:24,769
questions people always show principal

1229
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:27,559
component analysis but never tell us

1230
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:28,909
what the components what were the basis

1231
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:31,099
the components that you're doing that

1232
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:33,139
and it gets back to javas classes

1233
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:34,670
because our their components of their

1234
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:36,980
gene expression that you could more

1235
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:40,730
easily explained associated with making

1236
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:43,369
protoplasts and ours too so we are in

1237
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:46,730
the doing warrior telling for the

1238
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:50,089
project with the hookah and very long on

1239
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:52,820
I on the teaching condition in flow and

1240
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:57,289
development we are indeed looking more

1241
01:03:52,820 --> 01:04:00,470
into this specific of the different pc a

1242
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:04,610
component mental for these it was just a

1243
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:07,179
simple let's say way out to say well am

1244
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:09,920
i crazy or not the best m seller

1245
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:11,989
different than on stem cell because that

1246
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,570
is actually the ground truth if they

1247
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:17,509
would not have been different why to do

1248
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:23,480
the work that i'm doing so yeah but it's

1249
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:26,210
a good point i just i just actually fed

1250
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,099
in the talk that explain exactly what

1251
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,900
you're saying and I went to my postdoc

1252
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:31,759
and I said you need to look into these

1253
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,559
because we need to really show for these

1254
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,940
other projects yeah they are completely

1255
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:40,489
right when I have a question so I don't

1256
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:43,550
know much for the Scarecrow and I look

1257
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:45,109
you today but it's wonderful you show

1258
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,210
you once once if you want to geometry

1259
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:49,280
for me and then for a dime is two to one

1260
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,659
and one and so I kind of wonder whether

1261
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,750
it's just something to do with this

1262
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:55,519
portal activity yeah now is beautiful

1263
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:58,010
question Elena so

1264
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:01,880
a society that I really wanted to show

1265
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:04,550
the new set of data but they were just

1266
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,349
sooo preliminary so when I gather

1267
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:09,650
students and that goes back to your

1268
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:12,170
question well my graduate student saw is

1269
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:14,960
that in another yourself where they're

1270
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:17,570
both expressed the quiescent sensor the

1271
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:21,530
stoichiometry is actually flipped around

1272
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:24,680
and we will see so we see that we have

1273
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:27,620
to schedule and one shoulder and what we

1274
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:32,059
have seen is that you have a too short

1275
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:34,909
one scarecrow right starting when the

1276
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:38,329
cell will be close to division so the

1277
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:42,579
stem cell the CEI the stem cell divides

1278
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:45,920
about 18 to 24 hour it / symmetrically

1279
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:48,110
while the quiescent sensor is a less

1280
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:52,070
mitotically dividing cells but

1281
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:54,500
eventually divides a 72 hour or what I

1282
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:57,500
would like to see for example does

1283
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,630
history geometry changes in the quiet

1284
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,059
and sensor if we if we treat with

1285
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:05,090
brassinosteroid the question centers

1286
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:08,090
divides faster so what we're trying to

1287
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:10,100
do is to see the stoichiometry changes

1288
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:12,079
if there is a change in the south

1289
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:14,750
division so that we can link that and

1290
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,639
start to see a correlation and then go

1291
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:19,670
after the causation it is really the

1292
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:23,179
stoichiometry underline the timing of

1293
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:26,150
divisional us yes we don't know wait

1294
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:28,730
wave today's why I like I hope I could

1295
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,250
show this data testing this is not

1296
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:34,280
serious question oh go ahead i'm not a

1297
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:38,090
serious anything is you're not a few

1298
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:42,310
speakers for sure she can't assess the

1299
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:42,309
world is going to be better spent uh

1300
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:57,530
yeah I'm is a is a good point it's so

1301
01:06:53,269 --> 01:06:59,599
the point there is rather than convince

1302
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:03,370
my mom that the world would be rather

1303
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,599
fat is a message that I would like to

1304
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:07,659
say

1305
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:10,299
and saying he's always important to take

1306
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:11,920
five minutes and see why we're doing

1307
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,620
what we're doing because it's very basic

1308
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,260
what I'm doing is basic biology and so

1309
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:20,289
if I were to tell my mom what I'm doing

1310
