00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,280
University

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,429
Thank You Jacob so myself will be

4
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:18,599
focused on genetic architecture of

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:22,480
cyanide in cassava

6
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:25,089
so generally most plant species liberate

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,390
hydrogen cyanide from cyanogenic

8
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:32,439
glucoside and this process is known as

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,420
Lana Genesis Selena marine and Lotus

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,390
Raeleen are the two variants of

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,870
cyanogenic leukocytes in cassava and

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:45,009
these are bioactive a stable plant

13
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:47,890
secondary metabolites that provide

14
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:50,679
effective defense against hobby balls

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,859
for those plant now over the years they

16
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,140
have also taken up or rather evolved to

17
00:00:53,859 --> 00:01:01,119
take up additional responsibility of

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:04,478
providing plant plasticity and also

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,078
specifically in cassava cyanogenic

20
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,908
glucoside is synthesized in the leaf and

21
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:12,968
transported to the root and usually our

22
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,640
partition between the peel of cassava

23
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:17,879
and the parenchyma now looking at

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,670
specifically cassava with respect to

25
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,280
cyanide now cassava as we all know

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,728
cassava is an important economic and

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,118
subsystem crop and it produced

28
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:34,388
efficiently under sub optimal condition

29
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:38,618
and among many challenges that cassava

30
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:40,179
as a crop has assisted food is that it

31
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:42,789
has a high thermogenic

32
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:45,240
leukocyte and in the past our colleagues

33
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,618
have walked on the biosynthesis pathway

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,048
for Sano Jinnah glucoside

35
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:55,028
in cassava now one thing to take note of

36
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:57,069
is that hg n which is an acid trace of

37
00:01:55,028 --> 00:02:01,748
cyanide in cassava is a major

38
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:04,959
domestication trade now within cassava

39
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:07,708
breeding program and also food products

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,409
they usually use a simple diagnostic

41
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:14,140
test which is called pykrete

42
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:17,349
test to assay for for personalizing

43
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:22,299
cassava and it contains ten shades of

44
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:26,349
color charts are ranging from yellow

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,380
to brown and they represent cyanide

46
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,049
content in cassava in milligram now

47
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:34,990
specifically cassava is kind of

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,490
categorized into two you have the sweet

49
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,379
cassava and the bitter cassava and this

50
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,719
sweet and bitter cassava are also seen

51
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:49,719
as those having low cyanide and - I now

52
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:53,379
to consume cassava especially in South

53
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,599
Africa there are a couple of traditional

54
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,819
method of because scientist about

55
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,539
cyanide to get it to a level that is

56
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:04,780
safe for consumption what health level I

57
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:07,689
mean what held recommendation is 10 ppm

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,270
but some countries are Ivan you know

59
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,669
recommending lower than that but I

60
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,130
thought this this leaf is not specific

61
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:18,429
to any country but this is what this

62
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:24,129
part is across across southern Africa to

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:27,189
to reduce the sunnat' of cassava before

64
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,650
consuming it and I have a picture of a

65
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:32,889
woman that is roasting cassava so

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,379
basically you great along with pressing

67
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:39,339
and roasting but in addition you can

68
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,609
also soak some dry you can wet or heat

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,039
fermentation now any of these processes

70
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,920
would ordinarily if fuller strictly

71
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,359
reduce cyanide content of cassava but

72
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:55,299
oftentimes they don't follow it away so

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,490
cyanide poisoning still exists it might

74
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,120
not be in the extreme case in most cases

75
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:05,680
but you can see how other extreme cases

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,469
now we respect to how cassava is an

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,750
important staple in sub-saharan Africa

78
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:14,259
if you look at what production of

79
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,949
cassava you see that over 50 percent of

80
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:22,120
that production is coming from Africa

81
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:24,879
now this this now this does ensure that

82
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,790
you know we have to kind of tackle the

83
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:31,329
challenges that are associated with

84
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:34,479
cyanide in cassava so one of those

85
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:36,329
challenges is cyanide intoxication and

86
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,428
this happens usually

87
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,488
during agricultural crisis and happen

88
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:45,308
mostly within the region where you find

89
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:47,738
forests you know the poor people living

90
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:49,959
in rural area and what happened is that

91
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:54,638
during this agricultural crisis they

92
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:57,788
consume a lot of cassava consistent on

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,929
daily basis without successfully because

94
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:04,050
they find it but this leads to fan

95
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:06,399
identification based on individual

96
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,179
accessibility and the cyanide

97
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,610
intoxication is called kun zoo as a

98
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:14,049
neurological disease that is

99
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,110
irreversible and causes permanent

100
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,149
paralysis of the lower limb it was first

101
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:24,059
reported about eight decades ago for

102
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:27,369
example in Cambodia in 2002 about

103
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:29,499
100,000 cases was reported and I showed

104
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,629
a blood picture that depicts the

105
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:35,319
severity of disciplines of disease and

106
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:39,489
you can see in the severe case you end

107
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,218
up being permanently paralyzed now if

108
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:44,378
they resulted in couple of countries

109
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:48,069
within South Island Africa the most

110
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:49,479
recent is in Zambia between 2012 and

111
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:53,139
2015

112
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:55,240
about 40 cases have been reported now

113
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,389
I'm looking at this from the perspective

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,588
of future projection you will see that

115
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:05,288
what Food Program a prediction of food

116
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:08,678
insecurity as a result of climate change

117
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:10,959
is going to hit smooth in Africa and

118
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:14,168
that means there will be reduced use of

119
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:17,139
generally crop youth and that means

120
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:22,598
people would you know depend more on a

121
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:25,569
crop like a Saba but for subsistence so

122
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,308
in view of this what I try to do in this

123
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,209
study is to understand the architecture

124
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:34,209
and map the chin from breeding

125
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:37,838
perspective more or less providing a

126
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:41,949
tool or a Diagnostics that breeders can

127
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:44,228
use to bridge for the street now in this

128
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,689
study we're kind of collaborating with

129
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:48,728
my photographer reading program in

130
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,540
Brazil and we have access to over three

131
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:52,180
thousand five

132
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,540
and racism modern breeding lines coming

133
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,819
from you know the 26 states of Brazil

134
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:05,290
and that we have six trials I was done

135
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:08,980
in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 and so we

136
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:12,660
came up with a schema for analysis about

137
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,730
to process the genetic data as well as

138
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,580
do a phenotypic analysis and use me

139
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,270
smaller to do it she was also we looked

140
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,949
at the phenotypic distribution and also

141
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,259
estimated variance component as well as

142
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,149
heritability now one thing to take home

143
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,129
here is that for this data set that

144
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,199
we're looking at from Brazil the

145
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:35,019
heritability is high and it tells us

146
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,680
that the stress will would have high

147
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,839
response to selection in Brazil now with

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,900
this gos and this was the results we got

149
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,479
for the Chile's we we found we got two

150
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:50,589
peaks one and chromosome 14 I want in

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,439
chromosome 16 and that is explaining the

152
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:58,119
regulation the variance that we see in

153
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:01,269
our data set and and so it's safe to say

154
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,560
that the hessian in this dataset is

155
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:07,810
regulated in an oligo Janique manner so

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,589
going forward we looked at the math

157
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:14,379
effect of candidates markers or candida

158
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:17,560
sniffs both focus on 14 and chromosome

159
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:20,019
16 another chromosome 14 shows additive

160
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,430
response why that aluminum 16 shows

161
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:27,310
dominance response and so listed below

162
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,920
is the number of individuals in each of

163
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,740
the genotypic categories but again

164
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:37,090
looking at the responses it is safe to

165
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,399
say that that this particular trait can

166
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,610
be bright using a simple a brilliant

167
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,399
strategy within the breeding program I

168
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:49,419
also estimated variance explained across

169
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,720
the genome but across also sub genomes

170
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:55,959
of interest specifically chromosome 16

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,330
explained 50% of variance in our data

172
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,210
says while candidates knitting

173
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,320
chromosome 16 explained 30 percent of

174
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:08,000
the variation in our data set

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,980
HCN my very forward we went back to

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,169
literature to check since the

177
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,300
biosynthesis pathway for this personage

178
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:17,689
any glucoside is been reported in the

179
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:19,969
past so we looked at the geometric

180
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,070
disrepair and the schematic you know

181
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,700
diagram of the Basking turkish gene

182
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,680
cluster and that the arrow is showing

183
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,600
the functional genes and their direction

184
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,779
is issuing the orientation of the chain

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,420
and this was done in cassava draft

186
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:38,149
genome fashioned for so we took those

187
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:41,479
genes and we map them to our fashion fix

188
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:44,899
of cassava genome that is used the

189
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,560
process by genotyping data so it's not

190
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:51,379
that those genes that are actually in

191
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,279
chromosome 12 so not in any of those

192
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:58,509
region that we found pigs corporation so

193
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,829
we did with it genome-wide epistasis

194
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:06,769
interaction and we actually did about

195
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:09,759
400 million tests across the genome

196
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:13,069
however we found no inter chromosomal

197
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,830
interaction across the genome for this

198
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,520
trait now just a brief just some

199
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,990
takeaways so far for the things I've

200
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
shown I've shown that happiness

201
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:28,669
irritability and that of genotypically

202
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,480
basis is 0.74 and 0.41 and then that the

203
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:35,149
regulation is responding in oligogenic

204
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,490
manner and there are two peaks are one

205
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:40,399
increment of 14 one in chromosome 16 and

206
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,919
they are explained in 16 percent and 50

207
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,779
percent aberration respectively from

208
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,319
zone 14 shows a bit leaf pattern

209
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:51,529
understand 7 percent wider of 16 shows a

210
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,550
dominant pattern unexplained 30 percent

211
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:57,439
of genetic variation now also we have no

212
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:59,539
evidence based on these data sets where

213
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,670
the species interaction are going

214
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:04,699
forward we did a couple of complimentary

215
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:08,149
analysis the map are the gene that is

216
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,650
responsible for the variation and this

217
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:16,519
is just a summary table specifically in

218
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:20,720
in the in the column where I have

219
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:24,649
the the healthy interval for chromosome

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,420
16 we have 16th Y chromosome 14 we have

221
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,090
three genes and I found religion based

222
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,579
on optimal p-value and a mutation

223
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:35,750
prediction is a transfer ties between an

224
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,700
anesthetist protein in 14 and their

225
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,559
standard a snips are found within the

226
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,930
coding region of those candidate genes

227
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:45,559
now I had initially described a

228
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:47,389
situation in Africa but we started with

229
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,029
Brazilian data and the reasoning that

230
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,120
acaba originated from Brazil and was

231
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:56,990
also domesticated in it was transferred

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,750
to to Africa but they were additional

233
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,549
improvement I was done that changed the

234
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,320
genome last year so the idea was in

235
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:06,319
landfill in Brazil and then apply that

236
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,530
knowledge to Africa we went to the

237
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,900
Ferger base and found lots of try about

238
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:15,019
300 might be three trials that was done

239
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:17,059
across 23 years and we use this virtuous

240
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:19,699
or this trait we've used on unity big

241
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,639
distribution and its method of area as

242
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,850
well as a heritability and one thing we

243
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,970
observe in this case is that the genetic

244
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,730
variance a variation is low but that if

245
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,480
we did the GOS analysis we also found

246
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:38,960
two peaks one in 14 and one in 16 if

247
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,420
you're aligned is with the previous data

248
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,070
size coming from Brazil you see that

249
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,409
they properly aligned so it's safe to

250
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,770
say that at least based on this data set

251
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:51,110
the genetic architecture comes up we

252
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,059
also did joint u.s. analysis we found

253
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,850
the same peak and even in this case the

254
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:58,789
candidates are we're separated from the

255
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,790
rest of the snips and we also aligned it

256
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:04,399
with the previous dual result it's

257
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:06,529
Alliance are probably so just to just

258
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,069
summarize the results for this data set

259
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:13,039
we saw that the phenotypic variability

260
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,440
varies across you know the two data sets

261
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,799
and healthy and is conducting both

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,510
dataset HC&amp;S your belated in an

263
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,990
illegitimate manner we found no evidence

264
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:28,279
based on this data set that there is a

265
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,159
stasis interruption and so since we

266
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,069
define any peak in chromosomes

267
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,279
where we found those genes that we tend

268
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,440
to speculate that perhaps domestication

269
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,809
of cassava targeted upstream or

270
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,260
downstream genetic regulation steps of

271
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:47,169
HCN biosynthesis so one of the

272
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:50,049
deliverables is to there's a lot of

273
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:52,569
stuff for my house that is available to

274
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:56,409
the community for breeders to use of

275
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,990
breeding diagnostic nests test I will be

276
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:02,079
to do functional characterization

277
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,779
knockout validation of the diagnostic

278
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,660
market and Africa as well as as well as

279
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,250
expression studies run long term I want

280
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,620
to look at the impact of climate change

281
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,990
and cyanide and also to develop

282
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,360
materials that can be deployed to this

283
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,509
cyanide intoxication how sports in

284
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,159
sub-saharan Africa that's what wouldn't

285
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:23,679
have been possible without a lot of

286
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:26,319
people specifically I want to thank my

287
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,589
comic salute actually a Susan and

288
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,210
generous but also breeding program in

289
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,530
Reseda which led by EDA

290
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:38,139
and as our collaborators in Africa and

291
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:42,339
it's my Rabi we're doing the web

292
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:45,340
presentation the marketers we develop I

293
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,590
also want to appreciate me girl we're

294
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,430
working with the lab to functionally

295
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,300
validate our high-beam I was

296
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,439
appreciative Oaks and Muller lab

297
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:56,109
especially DM

298
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,680
whom was always available to answer my

299
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,590
question and what that means that's what

300
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:05,500
I've been is initially when he was a

301
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,720
pilot for now often time I accidentally

302
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,570
school question and he was generous to

303
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,750
answer that I want to thank BPI from our

304
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,170
past and plant breeding thank you a big

305
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,639
question thank you very much Alex I

306
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:20,620
think I'll have a bit of time for a

307
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,659
couple of questions and buckler's has

308
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,700
nice thoughts outs to that he was speaks

309
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:27,159
overlap with diversity sweep seen in the

310
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,720
hapmap and does the biosynthetic cluster

311
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:34,329
on crimson twelve have little diversity

312
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:38,830
according to a map yeah so if I get the

313
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:44,020
question arises so we we so we might

314
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:48,220
both musician I lives within the half

315
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:50,169
we also did a whole genome institution

316
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,399
using the hapmap as a reference for that

317
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:58,959
particular our chromosome 16 and we

318
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,529
found the same the same result we we

319
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,050
found the same region and the same

320
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:10,809
sneak-attack candidates me if if I

321
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:12,399
answer a question okay Kristen asks

322
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:14,709
thanks Alex do you have a sense for how

323
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,149
decreasing cyanide contents may impact

324
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,430
test resistance and therefore

325
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:23,919
potentially yield so yeah they've been

326
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:25,209
that this question always comes up I

327
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,269
didn't I didn't look at this

328
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,830
specifically but what I try to do here

329
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,559
is to understand the genetic

330
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:36,100
architecture to have this knowledge or

331
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:39,489
information would be used for that to do

332
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:43,840
specific studies and how it does affect

333
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:47,620
