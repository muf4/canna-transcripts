1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,920
University um so thank you so much for

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:17,320
um inviting me to give this this seminar

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,920
today um I know it is a Plant Pathology

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,920
seminar and I'm going to talk about

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,118
insect resistance uh but there is a

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,599
little bit of Plant Pathology later on

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:30,039
in the in the seminar um I'm just for

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,920
disclaimer purposes I'm not going to

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,480
take any questions or comment on any uh

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,000
political implications that impact or

12
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,398
have impacted the research that we're

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,719
doing in the potential for continuing

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,920
the project or not so I would just put

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,359
that out there um let's talk about the

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,679
how the technology went from all the

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:53,840
Innovation to how it has been adopted in

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,920
Bangladesh and the impact that we've

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
seen so far what we think is going to

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
happen in the future with this

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
technology and the opportunities that

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,400
exist so that's what I'm going to focus

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,159
on today it's a good

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,519
story so this is why we're going to con

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,600
to focus on the Partnerships that made

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,519
this

27
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:18,679
uh project possible it has been about 20

28
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,280
years uh SE of investment in

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,040
collaboration between

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,719
organizations and I'm currently the the

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Project Director for the last uh or the

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:34,560
current investment from uh USA um into

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,199
BT egpl so why BT egpl why is important

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,359
so egpl is the second most important

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,640
vegetable in Bangladesh and as you can

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,799
see in this picture there is a lot of

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,799
diversity um of the eggplants so most of

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,479
the eggplants that we consume here are

39
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,560
uh not necessarily part of the diversity

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,799
that you see in Bangladeshi uh diet

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,359
there is a lot of diversity of around a

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,118
100 different varieties types of of uh

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,478
eggplants are growing in Bangladesh so

44
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:07,280
this is important as we continue to talk

45
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,758
about um how our technology has been

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,360
delivered and it's grow by um 150,000

47
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:18,279
resource for Farmers um and this is the

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,519
challenge that they face every year um

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:26,318
the egpl uh fruit and Sho border can

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:28,599
reduce yield by about 70% even after uh

51
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,518
intensive use of

52
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:34,679
insecticides um Bangladeshi Farmers

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,158
spray about a hundred times in one

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,640
season 100 time insecti size that are

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,318
neurotoxin and for those of you that

56
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,878
have never uh grown an eggplant eggplant

57
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,639
is not something that you harvest once

58
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,840
you will hars over month so think about

59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,598
the implications of that for insecticide

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,800
application you are spraying insecticide

61
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,399
without any safety gear any

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
protection and as you are spraying

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
you're also going to be harvesting on

64
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,399
the same day or the day

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,080
after and it's not necessarily a person

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,599
that the person that is going to be uh

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,680
using the insecticide will be an adult

68
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,318
or somebody that has been trained it can

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,000
be the children in the family it can be

70
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,560
elderly it will be women it will be

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,799
young people as range so again think

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,439
about that so when we think about why

73
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,400
was this so important why is this

74
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,359
intervention so necessary so it's not

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
just a scientific curiosity is not

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,560
because the technology was just

77
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:38,318
available because there is a true need

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,759
so the cry1 A1C uh Gene from basilo

79
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,560
tenses can render um eggplant resistant

80
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,039
a single Gene can uh provide the

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,158
resistance for the fruit and shoe border

82
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,039
that is the major pass of Egan there's

83
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:55,519
other minor uh passs and uh that impact

84
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:59,000
the yield but the fruit and Sh B is the

85
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,158
ma it's the the major and the company

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,079
Miko had developed BT act plan Mahiko is

87
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:08,719
a company in India and that many uh here

88
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:12,920
at Cornell are familiar with um had this

89
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,919
uh C1 Cene uh incorporated into BT into

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,478
Ean uh through the what is called the E1

91
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:23,279
event so it is a transgenic prop um that

92
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,240
was developed uh in the private sector

93
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,839
and through that

94
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:33,519
collaboration um with Cornell with sarur

95
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,599
gur consultant um in the Bangladesh

96
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,560
agricultural Research Institute as the

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,479
recipients of that technology but

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,918
broader uh interaction with the

99
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:47,120
Bangladeshi government Mahiko gave the

100
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,240
technology to Bari licens the technology

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,680
free of charge and free of royalty so

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,038
that they can produce BT Ean varieties

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,240
that are adapted for the Bangladesh

104
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,879
environment so these were varieties that

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,360
are already existed in B the Bangladesh

106
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,680
agricultural Research Institute they

107
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
have developed it based on their market

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,759
knowledge and the knowledge of their

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,959
scientists and their communities these

110
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,759
are varieties that were already adapted

111
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,918
to the area and then the gene was then

112
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,479
inserted so this was not varieties that

113
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,478
were coming from somewhere abroad

114
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,959
without being tested so I want to

115
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,959
clarify that because I know that um many

116
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,079
of the um GMO uh crops that we think

117
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,120
about we think about multinational that

118
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,879
introduce use their hybrids or varieties

119
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,759
into a country and hope for the best no

120
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,279
this was not this was very well thought

121
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,639
and planned um and it was highly uh

122
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:46,159
consulted with the Bangladeshi uh

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,280
Research Institute and government so uh

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,160
from 2004 to 2009 these varieties were

125
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,119
developed through back Crossing nine

126
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,199
popular varieties in October of 2013

127
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,360
four varieties were

128
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,360
released and here you can see the

129
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,080
minister of agriculture

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,879
um MAA Shri U providing the first btpl

131
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:12,439
seeds to 20 farmers in 2014 so 20

132
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,959
farmers in 2014 received the first seed

133
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,800
so that tell you about the political

134
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,879
willingness that was necessary and was

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,400
behind that technology so we have

136
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,120
Innovation we have science and then we

137
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,598
have political will and we have

138
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,319
involvement of the relevant uh

139
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,800
stakeholders in Bangladesh so this kind

140
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
of showcase here the institutions that

141
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,360
were involved in this uh collaboration

142
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,839
so not only the Bangladesh agricultural

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,400
Research Institute that it would be kind

144
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,959
of like the counterpart of the USDA but

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,799
then also a um arm of the organization

146
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,598
that produces seeds because we're going

147
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,520
to hear that then is not only bringing

148
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,598
the technology to the country but then

149
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,719
how do you produce seed to reach the

150
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,199
farmers and also we needed to do our

151
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,319
reach communication so we have the um

152
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,400
farming future Bangladesh that is a

153
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,680
group of uh Young

154
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,279
um journalists and communicators that do

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,199
Outreach in the community understand the

156
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,198
culture understand the values of the

157
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,478
culture understand the language can

158
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,639
speak the language reaching out to them

159
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,079
and then we have Cornell we have

160
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,079
different uh the Ministry of Agriculture

161
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,839
and we have Seth Guru that helps broker

162
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,079
that relationship between the private

163
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,079
and the public uh organizations that

164
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,038
then turn out to be this public private

165
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,680
public partnership that has been so

166
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,959
successful so from 2014 when 20 Farmers

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,759
received uh the first seats in four

168
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,000
districts now through all this

169
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,319
collaboration through these

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,598
organizations in terms of demonstration

171
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,319
plots um involving the extension agents

172
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,158
producing seed making sure that that

173
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,000
seed is pure that has good quality and

174
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:55,000
coordinating efforts across them now we

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,720
have over 65,000 Farmers every year

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,079
growing uh BT equan um these varieties

177
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,120
are open pollinated so what that means

178
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,959
it's it's great that farmers can keep

179
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,478
seed of it but it makes it very

180
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,839
challenge to know where the seity is

181
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,680
going so we are making some assumptions

182
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,560
based on seed that has been distributed

183
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,079
but also we know that based on our um

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,839
studies that about 15 to 25% Farmers may

185
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,680
be keeping seed for next Seas or passing

186
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,198
on to their neighbors or their fames so

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
we know that the number may be much

188
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
higher because we cannot uh keep track

189
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,278
of all the seed that is in the market

190
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,278
in addition to the formal SE

191
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,759
system so these are the four varieties

192
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,319
that were released and as you can see

193
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,038
this is the diversity I was talking to

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,080
you about so they have green eggplant

195
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,639
purple eggplant pink implant um with

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,080
striation we know striation elongated

197
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,799
round it's you name it it's it's they

198
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,200
have different varieties that they like

199
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,278
for different dishes for different

200
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
purposes now even to the point that even

201
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,958
within a variety they will be looking at

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,720
in the market let's say this green um

203
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,078
GRE green variety that is very large

204
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,600
some families will be looking for

205
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,239
smaller fruit because they only have

206
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,839
four people in the family or two people

207
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
in the family so they don't have to feed

208
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,040
a family of seven anymore so they want

209
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,519
small fruits so they don't waste food so

210
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,639
all of this is important when you're

211
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,000
talking about a vegetable um one thing I

212
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:25,319
forgot to mention and that it may be uh

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,759
um relevant is that most people think

214
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,160
that when we think about insecticide or

215
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,360
pesticides in general that are these um

216
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,679
commodity crops the ones that consume

217
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the most but a lot a lot of the

218
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,319
pesticides are actually used in

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,240
vegetables and fruit because it's

220
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,640
economically you can make a case for it

221
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,000
and so we like our fruits and vegetable

222
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,799
to be damage free um there's also a high

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,879
value of these products in the market so

224
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,199
that when the farmer has to do the math

225
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,519
they say well I can if I protect my

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,640
yield I really get a revenue even if I

227
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,200
have to app apply the the pesti signs

228
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,720
so these is the numbers that we're

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,519
getting after um the adoption of BT Ean

230
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,560
So based on an independent study uh

231
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,480
we're seeing negligible fruit

232
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:20,199
infestation in btpl compared to 45% in

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,039
nonb eggplant we see a 61% saving on

234
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,120
pesticide cost so think about that about

235
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,799
40% of the cost of production is

236
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,799
insecticide and we're seeing a 61%

237
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,278
reduction on insecticide cost use uh

238
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,838
just from one single Gene in this

239
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,838
technology we see a six time increase in

240
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,320
farmac net return we see have 21%

241
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,279
increase in gross revenue and about 20%

242
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,440
higher uh fruit yield um so the fruit

243
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,240
yield here comes in different ways not

244
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,000
only um the variety yield is is better

245
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,399
but every fruit is marketable or has a

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,440
potential to be marketable because it

247
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,000
doesn't have the damage from this um

248
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,040
this pth in addition at the market level

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,839
once the fruit is in the market every

250
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,000
fruit that is in the market can be

251
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,519
marketable again and then at the kitchen

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,240
level the people that are buying the

253
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
fruit can consume the entire fruit

254
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,000
because there's no damage so uh if you

255
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,879
don't know what what the Border causes

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
it it's having a warm inside of the

257
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,439
fruit or having the the larv growing

258
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,399
inside the fruit so the the at the

259
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,000
kitchen level the person will have to

260
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,159
cut away and throw away like you know

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,078
when you do with your potatoes when

262
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,000
there's some damage no so think about

263
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,679
that when it's highly damaged and now

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,559
you can consume the entire fruit so when

265
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,319
we think about not only yield but food

266
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,399
loss and food waste at the farm level

267
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,920
and the kitchen all of this is reduced

268
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,360
because of this

269
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,719
technology and then we see about 41%

270
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
reduction in toxicity um from the

271
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,759
pesticides you use and based on their

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,278
own reports um of symptoms this is from

273
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,278
the farmers and and the

274
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:02,000
household so in the current investment

275
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,919
uh since this technology since 2014 has

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,440
been so successful in terms of getting

277
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,240
adoption and getting track in the field

278
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,040
what we wanted to do was to increase

279
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,680
that adoption and the long-term

280
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,719
sustainability because now we know that

281
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,919
technology is accepted it's in those

282
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,800
four varieties the farmers are growing

283
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,159
it so how do we protect this technology

284
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,479
not only for Bangladesh but for the

285
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,360
surrounding region because BT we know

286
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,920
can be overcome um by the passive is not

287
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,120
uh properly

288
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:34,240
protected so in the um IRB that is the U

289
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,078
insect resistant Ean partnership um

290
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,079
project um the goal is to scale up the

291
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,439
adoption of these four varieties that

292
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:45,198
carry that c1c Gene we want to develop

293
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,639
the next generation of btan in this case

294
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,278
hybrids and varieties uh but hybrids are

295
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,639
really important because since the

296
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,278
technology was developed and it was

297
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,519
developed for uh resource for farmers

298
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,278
and the idea was that well if if it's

299
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,639
resource for Farmers let's make sure

300
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,078
that it's open po so they can maintain

301
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,839
seed that the culture has changed

302
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,359
significantly farmers are buying hybrids

303
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,880
because they know the return of

304
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,320
investment so they're buying hybrids of

305
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:16,039
of potato of uh Peppers of tomato of

306
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,360
eggplant itself and you will see the

307
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,278
numbers later so we know the culture has

308
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,440
changed not only in Bangladesh but in in

309
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,799
South Asia in Asia in general in in

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,000
Africa too because the farmers are risk

311
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,559
adverse but they will try things once

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,078
and if they sue a return on investment

313
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,599
they will do it but at the same time if

314
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,439
they don't see any good return on

315
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
investment they they're pretty smart

316
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,480
they will do the math and they will not

317
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,399
buy hybrids if it doesn't make sense to

318
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,199
them but they are buying hybrids so we

319
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,078
know by a fact that there is a market

320
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,879
for

321
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,559
that there's also we need a a reason uh

322
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,120
a way to strengthen the value chain

323
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,919
because the value chain goes from all

324
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,039
the way from the seed development all

325
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:57,039
the way to the consumption so how do we

326
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:00,958
make that uh value chain more inclusive

327
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:03,078
for different um people in the community

328
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,078
different segments and then how do we do

329
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:06,879
more Outreach and education so people

330
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,879
that are not aware of that technology or

331
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,879
may have some misinformation or or just

332
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,000
really are curious about it can't get

333
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,360
the right information and that includes

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,159
not only the public the consumer but the

335
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,839
scientists themselves and the policy

336
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,198
makers that are making the

337
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,440
decisions so we we want to improve the

338
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,719
enabling environment for btan and

339
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,480
biotech in general um in Bangladesh and

340
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,839
also we were involed we are involved in

341
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,000
supporting that commercialization and um

342
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,320
BT plan in the Philippines I'm not going

343
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,519
to talk about the Philippines today

344
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,360
because that's a whole different seminar

345
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,360
uh it will take another hour to go over

346
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,919
it so how do we do this we do this

347
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,560
through ensuring high quality seed

348
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,519
availability and Market of Market prefer

349
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,479
varieties we do have an increasing

350
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,078
adoption of the existing egpl so that it

351
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,360
can reach um Beyond those four initial

352
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,319
District or the eight District that

353
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,199
we're working but we know that again the

354
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,480
Agriculture and the consumer preferences

355
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:05,439
are changing so there's more

356
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,440
opportunities for ekan in the

357
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,919
country we're doing it also by enhancing

358
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,000
the distribution providing uh effective

359
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,198
technology stewardship again to protect

360
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,759
that technology um and increasing uh the

361
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:21,439
value for farmers and and consumers

362
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,278
while reducing the environmental impact

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,800
of the Agricultural production in

364
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,679
general um Bangladesh is has such an

365
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,120
intense intensive agricultural system so

366
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,120
if you think exp as an example but many

367
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,759
other vegetable crops are having the

368
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,000
same challenges and it that means the

369
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,480
same amount of insecticides or more and

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,759
other pesticides that are um going not

371
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,759
only into the fruit and vegetables and

372
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,039
other crops but also to the water the

373
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,680
soil insecticide that are broad spectrum

374
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,799
that are eliminating beneficial uh

375
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:57,879
insects while the B can be so uh as

376
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:00,318
specific and allow for the uh beneficial

377
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,000
insects to survive support the rest of

378
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:04,919
the of the

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,639
ecosystem so this is done through a very

380
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,159
uh diverse group of people in my team

381
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,799
and it it is beautiful to have diversity

382
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,958
in terms of perspective knowledge

383
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:19,078
expertise um age groups so people that

384
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,159
are willing to go to the field and talk

385
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:25,198
to the farmers or talk can reach to

386
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,759
women um working in agriculture uh

387
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,039
people that can reach to policy makers

388
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,680
so that can have the potential to you

389
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,519
know translate the the basic science to

390
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:38,239
uh policy makers and to the public um so

391
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,519
we work very closely with all of these

392
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
uh group of amazing scientists to make

393
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,318
this possible and this is an

394
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,560
International Community um supporting

395
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,958
the national scientist in in Bangladesh

396
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,399
and this is part of the group of

397
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,638
scientists that we um employed in

398
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,198
Bangladesh in in the IR office that are

399
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,560
reaching out through extension agents

400
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,559
that are reaching out to like the SE

401
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,519
producers that are working with the

402
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,558
scientists uh to make sure that the

403
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,918
technology is Flowing on time to the

404
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,918
right plac is at the right

405
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:18,240
time so here you can see a little bit of

406
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:20,519
the um how the adoption has occur and so

407
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,759
I want to point out here so you can see

408
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:27,240
a an increase uh significant increase of

409
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,679
adoption of eggplant um depending of the

410
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,720
different sources of seed this is what

411
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,600
we used to determine how many people are

412
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,200
are growing

413
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,038
btpl and so you can see here for example

414
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,600
a big dip in 2021 2022 so that was not

415
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:45,960
this adoption that was access to se the

416
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,279
problem so we know that tell us that we

417
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,079
needed to be more proactive of making

418
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,079
sure that the seed was getting to the

419
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,720
farmers at the right time because the

420
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,158
intensification of agriculture in

421
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,038
Bangladesh only allows you a very uh

422
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,720
small period of time to get these uh

423
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,279
seat to the ground and if you don't

424
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,960
catch it at the right time the weather

425
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,279
may not be conducive or the farmer

426
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
thinking you know what I'm not going to

427
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,279
get the yield that I I was expecting

428
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,480
from this crop because it needed to be

429
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,440
planted three weeks ago so if I don't

430
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,120
plant it right now I'm not planting it

431
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,919
so we see that the was seat was not

432
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,479
available that year through

433
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,520
communication it just it just it didn't

434
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,679
happen and as soon as we start uh

435
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,319
putting more seed out there we saw a lot

436
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,559
more Farmers also growing um uh

437
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,000
btan and I way this is taken into

438
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:34,558
account not the seat that was produced

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,400
but the seat was distributed and we take

440
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,440
into account what was returned so these

441
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,600
are actual numbers of seed that was

442
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,360
distributed uh to Farmers and to

443
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,079
dealers um so what do we have right now

444
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,479
so we have these four varieties so we

445
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,439
have three different streams four

446
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,880
varieties that were released in

447
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,000
2014 that's the first um kind of block

448
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,799
that you see here these four varieties

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,359
now we have two additional new products

450
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,319
that are in the pipeline and this is

451
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,798
what is called btb gun 10 and 11 and

452
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,759
they are right now being um back Frost

453
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,759
um through again that collaboration with

454
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,158
Maho um and we'll talk a little bit more

455
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,879
about that and then our third uh

456
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,600
pipeline of products is this hybrid

457
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,600
products that are also under

458
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,480
development so I want to take a moment

459
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,280
to kind of explain a little bit about

460
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,279
the interactions between all of the

461
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,960
different organizations so in Bangladesh

462
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,759
these are all of the uh organizations

463
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,319
that are actively involved in the

464
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,319
project so you have body that is the

465
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,119
agricultural Research Institute we have

466
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,798
badc that is that seed arm then we have

467
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:45,959
what is called Dae that is Al the uh

468
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,960
extension arm and all of them have a

469
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,840
particular uh responsibility in the

470
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,400
value chain some of them are producing

471
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,798
like the nucleus seed or breeder seed

472
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,720
Foundation seed then they do quality

473
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,480
assessment they then do the production

474
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,919
of seed for packaging and to get it to

475
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,079
Growers um and then through the dealer

476
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,759
networks that exist in the country and

477
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,399
then we have the distribution and sell

478
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:11,400
that happen from that dealer through uh

479
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,720
extension agents through Farmers coming

480
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,679
to the dealers or for um through

481
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,279
informal systems too um and now we're

482
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,080
adding this layer of um another layer of

483
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,119
access to the technology that is through

484
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,839
using nurseries so this was something

485
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,038
that we started developing because we

486
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,720
realized that farmers are also going to

487
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,079
the nurseries like we do here at the in

488
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,120
the spring you start looking at for

489
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,240
those ceilings so you can save some time

490
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,879
in Bangladesh is is really important

491
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,919
because if you have these rains and you

492
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,280
have planted and the rains come in you

493
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,960
may lose your fi but by having seedlings

494
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,678
you're adding some flexibility to your

495
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,480
planting and you can recover in case of

496
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,480
you lost that seed that you planted

497
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,599
early you can buy seedlings and then

498
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,120
being able to to plant them right away

499
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,480
so you're winning you know you're

500
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,359
gaining all of those three or four weeks

501
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,279
instead of having to deal with damping

502
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,119
off in the field so now you can have

503
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,158
your seedling and you have a much better

504
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:11,519
stand so we look at different ways for

505
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,240
um uh increasing the

506
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,839
accessibility um so there a lot of

507
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,319
farmer uh demonstration plots that

508
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,119
continue to happen because there are

509
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,599
more and more Farmers interested and

510
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,599
we're also learning that there's a lot

511
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,719
of farmers that are still not aware of

512
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,759
that

513
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,000
technology so this is how the seat

514
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:36,119
packages look um in in the in the corner

515
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,400
you can see we uh we include how the the

516
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,959
field needs to be planted in in

517
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,559
for

518
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,960
btpl to protect the technology what we

519
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,879
do is that we have BT Ean planted as

520
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,319
traditionally in the field and then you

521
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,480
put a border of uh non-bt Ean to protect

522
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,240
um that technology by allowing the

523
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,720
insect to reproduce in those uh nonb so

524
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,919
you're not putting a lot of selection

525
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,558
pressure uh on the pest at this time

526
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,400
because we only occupy about 10% of the

527
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:12,759
potential uh

528
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,679
eim hectors and in uh acreages in um in

529
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,359
Bangladesh we're not concerned about the

530
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,320
lack of Refuge what we call Refuge that

531
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,959
is that non-bt uh but we know that

532
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,558
adoption increases this will be more

533
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,919
important so we're making sure the

534
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,839
farmers are used to plant it however we

535
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,278
know that the reality is quite different

536
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,359
in the fields farmers are thinking about

537
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:34,400
every single inch of that Fields like

538
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,158
why would I plant it to something that

539
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
it I will lose if I cannot spray it or

540
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,960
you know then we said well you you

541
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,520
cannot just spray it to eliminate

542
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,480
because the goal is that you have that

543
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:48,079
the the pest going into that and um what

544
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,319
we suggested to them was if you're not

545
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,798
going to plant this isoline that is BT

546
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,720
think about it all the other varieties

547
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,519
that you like to grow of BT of eggplant

548
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,720
that because we only have four varieties

549
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,558
and you said oh you know in your house

550
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,079
you want to plant the pink one too or

551
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,399
the L purple plant it in the corners so

552
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,879
instead of making it plant an isoline

553
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,480
like plant any other eggplant that you

554
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,600
would like to consume and then just put

555
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,440
it there and then you can Harvest that

556
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,158
one for consumption in addition to

557
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,240
protect the technology so that has

558
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,799
worked well but we have seen in every

559
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
single country if in even in the US like

560
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,038
farmers are not planting those Refuge as

561
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,599
expected for like uh BT corn and that's

562
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,440
how we ended with um resistant in the

563
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,439
past uh

564
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,839
population um so this is what I was

565
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,359
telling you about these uh nurseries

566
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:41,158
that we start incorporating so we have

567
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:44,639
about now like 400 uh nurseries that are

568
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,919
um producing seedlings of eggplant and

569
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
this is going really well because the

570
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,720
farm may have a new option we also uh

571
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,640
started um having nurseries that are led

572
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,000
by women so this is empowering women

573
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,679
through Nursery Enterprise model so in

574
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
addition to get learning about the E and

575
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,038
xpl they get the chance to learn about

576
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Finance bookkeeping marketing um and it

577
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:11,519
has been

578
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,880
extremely um rewarding to see how these

579
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,400
women are starting to work together and

580
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,000
so they create their own network they

581
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,600
are they have Facebook pages marketing

582
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,519
their products they're on the side of

583
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,158
road you see the signs and everything

584
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,960
because they're learning about um how to

585
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,200
Market uh Ean and the idea was that

586
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,600
through the value chain what are the

587
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,960
entry points for women and for youth in

588
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,879
Nursery is what a good way to for them

589
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,200
to participate of the benefits of that

590
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,640
technology so here you can see in some

591
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,798
in the pictures some of the women that

592
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,600
are uh working together in having those

593
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,679
nurseries so what we do we provideed

594
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:52,038
some basic infrastructure and knowledge

595
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,000
and then uh the idea is that from the

596
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:57,599
initial um season where they sell they

597
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
save and continue to buy then SE uh seed

598
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,439
in for the future or improving their

599
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
infrastructure and they have done

600
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,919
that um bar is also involved in the

601
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:11,679
compliance um of testing that the seene

602
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,880
is

603
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,919
um has the protein in that uh the

604
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,240
technology continues to be effective in

605
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,880
the field so they have to monitor the

606
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,720
technology in the field and this is

607
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,640
technology that can be used for other

608
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,000
purposes so they have learned how to use

609
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,520
Eliza and now it's just a a technology

610
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,558
that they use used in the lab every

611
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,480
single day uh so it goes beyond uh

612
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,000
capacity building for the technology

613
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,798
adoption but capacity building in the

614
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,119
biotechnology unit at Bari um and so

615
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,759
they are responsible as the owners of

616
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,278
that technology for all the um

617
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:53,798
compliance so doing they do the field

618
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:56,919
compliance and they also do um the what

619
00:25:53,798 --> 00:26:00,440
is called irm so they have to make not

620
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,840
only make sure that the seed has uh the

621
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,200
protein at the right level uh that con

622
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,439
contains uh the BT Gene but also that

623
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,159
the pathogen is not evolving to have

624
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,720
resistant to BT so they collect the

625
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,520
insect and bring it to the lab they feed

626
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,440
in uh the BT and wait for the insect to

627
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,599
die and to determine if there any any

628
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,038
resistant buildup and at this point we

629
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,798
haven't observed anything um that

630
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,879
suggests that there is a buildup of the

631
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:35,038
uh resistant in the uh past population

632
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,960
again we have a lot of Refuge of non-bt

633
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,398
uh in the field but we are we know that

634
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,038
it's not if if it is when so again

635
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,119
having that capacity in country is

636
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:47,200
essential for the

637
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:49,639
future so now we have these other two

638
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,558
varieties that are coming to to Market

639
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,159
in 2026 is what we hope and the idea

640
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,079
again they have two completely different

641
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,760
Market classes so we can add to the

642
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,678
market classes that we can serve but

643
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,319
they have higher yield and one of the

644
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,080
challenges that the previous varieties

645
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,960
have is it can only be planted in the

646
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,720
winter because in the summer season that

647
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,240
is the large uh season for eggplant they

648
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,278
are susceptible to wilt so this is the

649
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,278
difference when you have a director that

650
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,200
of the project that is an entomologist

651
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,519
but versus having a director that is a

652
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,720
PL pathologist so as soon as I realize

653
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,759
I'm like how we didn't do that so now

654
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,640
we're working on bringing Wilt resistant

655
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,919
and uh working with Adam in uh in our

656
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,278
unit we're trying to understand better

657
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,960
the population of the pathogen in the of

658
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,319
the whe pathogen uh on the ground but

659
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,278
because it's a solenia problem so we not

660
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:45,240
only we will be relevant for for Ean but

661
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,599
for also other solonas so um we hope

662
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,599
that we can bring some level of

663
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,079
tolerance so there is uh already some

664
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:54,158
evidence of Tolerance of um the wilt in

665
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,798
the body uh breeding programs but we

666
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,360
know we don't have immunity so I'll talk

667
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,359
a little bit more time on what we're

668
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,959
doing in terms of looking at immunity

669
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,759
but the idea is first understand the

670
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
pathogen population so we can then

671
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,798
inform our breeding a strategies for the

672
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,640
future and then do we have a proper

673
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:16,200
protocols in um body so they can test

674
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,200
for this tolerance to uh bacteria

675
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,759
wit um and in addition to the public

676
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,840
sector engagement that we have been

677
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,640
talking about with the private sector

678
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,119
now we're also looking at private to

679
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,919
private sector so the challenges of prod

680
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,038
producing seed the public sector is not

681
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,600
set up to produce seed for a much larger

682
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,240
um population of farmers growing BT

683
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,119
plant uh it's inefficient it's timec

684
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,798
consuming and so the the body can

685
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,639
continue to produce the the breeder seed

686
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,519
and the foundation seat but then um what

687
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,240
we hope is that private sector that is

688
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,519
better set up with the network to reach

689
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,240
out more farmers and produce seene can

690
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,558
come in into into the picture and also

691
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,640
with this uh idea of there is a market

692
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,960
for hybrids so they can serve that

693
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,880
market the open pollinated um varieties

694
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,038
can continue to be produced um and then

695
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
the hybrids can fit into a completely

696
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,319
different

697
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,640
market so this is the information that

698
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,439
we have at the moment that about 40% of

699
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,200
the Egan acreage is been grown to

700
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,080
hybrids you know local hybrids developed

701
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,159
by uh National and international

702
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,119
companies that are coming to Bangladesh

703
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,640
so that is a 40% of a market that we

704
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,759
could enter and reduce the use of

705
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,159
pesticide because they already growing

706
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,278
hybrids so what if these hybrids contain

707
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,360
the

708
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,640
BT so through again collaboration

709
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,839
between Cornell sath Guru and the

710
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
private sector we have identified

711
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,720
potential partners that can work

712
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,159
together um so they their partners that

713
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,839
have shown interest on entering the

714
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,919
market they're ready to make investment

715
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,678
so there's Indian companies that are

716
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,038
interested to working with Bangladeshi

717
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,640
company to have licensing agreements but

718
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,158
but there is also Bangladeshi company

719
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,679
that say I want my own hybrids with BT

720
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,799
can I work of getting a um just my

721
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,320
hybrids being converted instead of you

722
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,398
sending some of your hybrids that are

723
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,359
here so they're having this conversation

724
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,319
and our job is to Simply provide the

725
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:19,278
opportunity for them to meet to make

726
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:22,480
sure that the the the agreement will be

727
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,319
mutually uh beneficial for Bangladesh's

728
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,519
and in the private sector and that the

729
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,319
government is involved in this

730
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,079
conversation so there's no surprises

731
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,000
because here's a huge investment from

732
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,278
the private sector if they don't have a

733
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,759
market why would they invest so how do

734
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:36,079
we reduce the risk but by having

735
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,359
conversations with the government when

736
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,918
we make sure that there's an environment

737
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,079
that will be uh positive for seeing an

738
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,799
investment in the private sector into it

739
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,038
and they can have the conversation early

740
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,000
on before the Investments are happening

741
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,359
but also that the companies can directly

742
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,599
talk to the government so they can show

743
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,119
that there is an interest so the

744
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,278
government see like oh there is a true

745
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,319
interest from local companies to enter

746
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,919
the market we can hear that the farmers

747
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,720
are interest CM hybrid so those

748
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,880
conversations take a lot of time and

749
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,480
effort so if we can help having those

750
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,799
conversations and bringing like the

751
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,120
facts of the science you know we can

752
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,158
provide an opportunity to uh make sure

753
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,678
that the companies in Bangladesh have

754
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,159
the infrastructure that they need you

755
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,880
know how do we select these companies

756
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,320
that can actually handle having GMOs or

757
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,080
developing their own GMOs they need a l

758
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,439
of of consultancy in terms of their

759
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,240
research the infrastructure they need so

760
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,440
we can provide that kind of knowledge to

761
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,599
them

762
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,240
and again the idea is to bring all these

763
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:38,319
other types of uh diversity of eggplants

764
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,599
that are popular in the market and so

765
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,638
there are some that are already have

766
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,879
been selected by the companies as the

767
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,719
ones that can fit very well in the

768
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,278
market in Bangladesh so you can see this

769
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,880
station the different sizes different

770
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,638
shape uh to fit in that market one thing

771
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,000
that we learned is that they really want

772
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:59,439
this shiny coat on the fruit because if

773
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,880
it's matte may look like it's old so

774
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,080
anything that you may have the best

775
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,639
resistance and the best yield and if

776
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:09,199
it's mad versus shiny it will not go

777
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,319
anywhere uh so again having these

778
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,080
conversations and this is where our you

779
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,000
know so our social scientists and

780
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,199
engaging with the farmer is so essential

781
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,599
so we understand what the protu needs to

782
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,798
look

783
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,398
like so we hope that these uh hybrids um

784
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:24,720
that already the conversations have

785
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:26,918
happened between the companies the

786
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,798
licensing agreements that happened could

787
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:32,799
be available as soon as 2026 and 2027

788
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:35,879
for testing these variety these hybrids

789
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:38,038
carry a different uh event a different

790
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,200
Gene because of they have a different

791
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,000
Gene that is not that cry1c that we've

792
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,558
been using they have to go through a

793
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,038
whole process of deregulation while our

794
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,720
varieties that bt1 and 11 that are

795
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,679
coming because they're using the same

796
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,079
gene they can just be uh approv with

797
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,320
agronomic tests so again this will take

798
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:00,558
more time and we will see if it's um the

799
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,359
government of Bangladesh will be ready

800
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,960
for going through the process so we

801
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,959
again we are having conversations with

802
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,880
them to make sure that there is a policy

803
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,120
environment that would allow for this

804
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,320
investment to be uh

805
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,398
successful um so we have learned a lot

806
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,839
of lessons um but one of the ones that I

807
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:18,359
wanted to point out in the interest of

808
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,199
time I'm going to focus a little bit

809
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:23,678
more on is the idea of again we have to

810
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,519
bring weth resistance so I use WT

811
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,399
resistance as an example so because when

812
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,759
you think about technology we're really

813
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,278
focused a lot of times on that

814
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,879
technology that science that but

815
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,480
remember we don't eat technology we eat

816
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,600
a product so if something I have learned

817
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,159
during this process and this is what I'm

818
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,879
so focused on working in this space of

819
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,240
of Science of making sure that the

820
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,639
science reached the farmer field is

821
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,839
because you need to understand what that

822
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:54,759
product needs to look like what does the

823
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:57,558
consumer is asking for so you know and

824
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,638
so to me the science Begins the moment

825
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:01,119
that you publish that paper no that that

826
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,519
that's not the end that's the beginning

827
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,439
it's like now how do I make sure that

828
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,000
that becomes a product and that

829
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,159
conversation needs to happen really

830
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
early on how is this science going to

831
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,398
make it to the field what does that

832
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,480
product needs to look at who I have to

833
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,638
have in my team that will support that

834
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,320
we bring that perspective so that I make

835
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,960
sure that that science is successful in

836
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,838
Farmers field and that's something that

837
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,760
we have learned for me it could be in

838
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,119
this case the pathology so we need to

839
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,960
make sure that we bring that those

840
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,639
additional traits in into the picture so

841
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,519
that because right now we are only

842
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,159
producing the BTF and in the winter

843
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,878
season but if we can bring it to the

844
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,200
summer season we have a much larger

845
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:40,358
impact in our varieties will be much

846
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,759
more adopted by the farmers in the

847
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:46,559
regions that have Wilt and that's is a

848
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,320
huge area of the area of of production

849
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,078
same thing we need to make sure that

850
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,519
again we have in place that knowledge in

851
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,039
the um biotech Unit A Bari and with

852
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,759
extension agents so they can speak about

853
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,358
that technology and also they are ready

854
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,720
ready for the challenges of the future

855
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:04,358
for example continue to do this instagr

856
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,519
system management to make sure that the

857
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:09,920
Refuge is planted around the border so

858
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,800
all of that needed to be um introduced

859
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,639
but it needs to be contined talked about

860
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,480
and developed because uh science move on

861
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,799
into the next uh best job so we need to

862
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,920
constantly be educating the scientists

863
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,480
the policy makers and and the public um

864
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,519
in all of this we also realize that the

865
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,719
body breeding program for sustainability

866
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:33,159
purpose need to be strengthened so one

867
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,439
thing is to say okay let's produce two

868
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:38,440
uh more varieties and then when we look

869
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,358
at the entire pipeline they may not be

870
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,320
varieties that can compete well in the

871
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,639
system today because now there's a lot

872
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480
more private sector investment there's a

873
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,559
lot better varieties out there our body

874
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,358
variey is going to be competitive if

875
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,759
we're talking about hybrids where does

876
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,400
the market is for that open poll intive

877
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,640
variety so all of these conversations

878
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,480
need to happen and um strengthen the the

879
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:03,799
breeding programs um for the the

880
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,318
technology to be successful in the long

881
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,318
run um we need to pay more attention to

882
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,800
extension

883
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:15,920
um what else and you know I think the

884
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,560
nursery uh investment have been really

885
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,599
opening an eye of different ways to

886
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,639
looking at the how the technology can be

887
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,640
adopted and what we thought thought

888
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,318
originally was the only way that we see

889
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,879
now we realized that we were missing a

890
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,639
whole new area again has grown

891
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
significantly over the last few years so

892
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:35,279
we see that there's a lot of more

893
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,960
opportunities for btpl to grow like I

894
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,200
mentioned only about 10% of the acreage

895
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,960
of Ean is grown to BT but every time we

896
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,159
talk to Farmers and we introduce them to

897
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,679
that technology and tell them uh what

898
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,679
the technology can do for them they all

899
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,239
want to grow it but the big question I

900
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,799
get is what is not in my preferred

901
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,679
variety is nothing about concerned about

902
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,800
BT is not concerned about what what you

903
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,358
know they they see the results they see

904
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,480
that it works they see that reduction

905
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,598
and insecticide use a lot of them tell

906
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,119
us that they will not eat eggplant

907
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,200
because they know how much insecticide

908
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:12,200
they use they don't tell me the same

909
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:13,759
thing about BT um so we have heard so

910
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,199
much we have learned so much during the

911
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,800
process so we know that there's a lot

912
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,039
more opportunities for BT technology but

913
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,000
again BT is it's like I said like it's

914
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,039
that's 0 1982 technology we need to

915
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,318
think about what is going to replace BT

916
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,079
what are the other proteins that we

917
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,519
haven't look at what are the other other

918
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,440
chemicals uh um natural chemicals like

919
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:37,079
turpins that uh terpenoids that could be

920
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,639
useful to prevent um uh insecticide

921
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,039
insecticide use that we reduce it but

922
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:46,400
also that will lead to less insecticide

923
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:48,599
um BT for example resistant in the field

924
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,240
you know in the pathogen the pest uh

925
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,200
getting resistant to

926
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,239
it um so this is some of the other

927
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,679
opportunities we started working with uh

928
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:02,318
Greg Martin a couple couple years ago on

929
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:06,519
looking at ptr1 so now we're so excited

930
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:09,318
that ptr1 can provide resistance to um

931
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,759
to wilt um and so it's like what is the

932
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:14,759
opportunity here so we started uh

933
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,319
evaluating these uh technology as a

934
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,280
potential use in initially we say oh

935
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:21,279
maybe the gene is there we can just

936
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,359
tweak it it can be something edited and

937
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,519
maybe easy to introduce that was not the

938
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,440
case but we needed to ask that question

939
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,119
and then uh what we realized is that um

940
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,920
eggplant has

941
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:38,358
uh all the elements necessaries for ptr1

942
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,720
to to work um but um let me just go back

943
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,239
here um so it has all the elements the

944
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,000
components needed for ptr1 response so

945
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,039
now it's like can we do this can we

946
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,199
introduce ptr1 as a second Gene so it

947
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:53,239
will be a dual uh purpose uh um

948
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,879
transgenic that not only provide

949
00:38:53,239 --> 00:39:00,479
resistant to um the eggplant fruit and

950
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,599
Sho B but that can provide immunity for

951
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,358
um Wilt but that required that Adam came

952
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,760
into the picture that's how Adam came in

953
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,559
the PA because we need to understand the

954
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,160
population of the of the pathogen and

955
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,000
the effectors to understand if ptr1 was

956
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:16,078
going to be effective and everything is

957
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,880
sing up that yes so again we have

958
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,839
technology that is here at Cornell and a

959
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,358
bti that we could use and continue this

960
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,119
next like generation of products so like

961
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,480
this we have so many technologies that

962
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,358
can be so useful in developing countries

963
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,199
for the benefit of the people and this

964
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,960
is like the role that I see for uh

965
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,439
Cornell and other Advanced research uh

966
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,159
universities and Institute is the work

967
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,760
that we do has a place in the world and

968
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:47,519
it can do really really good things um

969
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,440
so what we hope is that over the next uh

970
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,800
years we can continue to bring

971
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,358
technology like this uh to the field

972
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,880
because it's where it belongs it doesn't

973
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,679
belong just in a journal so thank you

974
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,880
for um listening today and with that

975
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,399
I'll take any

976
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,838
questions right that was very

977
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:13,079
interesting story than you so let's take

978
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,078
some questions here and and online as

979
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,838
well yes can you say a little bit more

980
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,358
about the resistance um to BT and

981
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,519
mechanism of that and that sort of thing

982
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:25,799
okay but you put me in the spot and I

983
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,759
feel again like I'm a grad student uh so

984
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,119
I'm not

985
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,440
as a non-

986
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,760
entomologist I can tell you that U the

987
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,119
resistant to BT is a recessive um it's

988
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:43,599
recessive and so what it means is that

989
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:46,160
for the resistant to uh to evolve it

990
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,280
will take time but if the pest can

991
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,078
continue to reproduce in non BT we are

992
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
not putting that selection pressure on

993
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,400
it so the idea is to delay the process

994
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,319
of selection by not putting pressure on

995
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,960
the p so by having this Refuge the

996
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,880
insect can continue to reproduce and

997
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,039
continue to be a minimum in a heteros

998
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,000
cyos if it develops so it doesn't go to

999
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:11,639
homus because we encounters more

1000
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,800
nonresistant individuals in the field so

1001
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,440
that's what we're hoping for no and so

1002
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,280
it's similar to when we uh release I

1003
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,039
will bring it to PL pathology host

1004
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,760
resistance so the idea is that you you

1005
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,079
stack your resistant genes so that you

1006
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,839
put less selection pressure you're

1007
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,318
putting selection pressure against

1008
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:32,159
multiple pathways so the idea by putting

1009
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:34,119
two or more uh BT genes we are going to

1010
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,759
reduce again the chance of if that

1011
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:41,599
mutation to become

1012
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,400
um uh um to be fixed in the populations

1013
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,559
to maintain a minimal of heterocyc

1014
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,079
hopefully we don't get there uh but then

1015
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,639
you have multiple BT genes to uh estack

1016
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,119
and so that's the goal that we will

1017
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:56,400
release Stacks or at least varieties

1018
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,559
that have different U BT genes to reduce

1019
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,280
the selection pressure in in One

1020
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:04,039
Direction do that helps yeah okay

1021
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,839
survive

1022
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:09,559
okay

1023
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:13,920
mentioned that there was

1024
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:16,159
lower due to issues with accessing seeds

1025
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,720
I was wondering if you could expand upon

1026
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,838
the barriers to accessing seeds and how

1027
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,838
you guys increased that

1028
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,480
access thank you for that question so

1029
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,639
the question is about how we reduce you

1030
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,199
know in in 2021 there was a reduction of

1031
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,440
um let's say adoption but it was really

1032
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:37,919
because accessibility to see so what and

1033
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,159
and so the question is what are we doing

1034
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,519
uh to to support like the SE production

1035
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,759
and get back into where we needed to to

1036
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:46,599
be producing so a lot have to do with

1037
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,440
communication so some of the dealers

1038
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,318
were saying oh we are not getting a pull

1039
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,440
from the market so we decided that with

1040
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:55,920
our limited resources we needed to focus

1041
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,358
on other crops and stop producing btx

1042
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,880
plant and so we had the conversation

1043
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,440
with do you go to the particular

1044
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,800
District where this BT is needed but is

1045
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,679
because if you look at the entire

1046
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,280
country it may be that you don't see the

1047
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,000
pool that is necessary because it has

1048
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,200
not been introduced across the entire

1049
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,079
country it has been selected a

1050
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,159
particular District that have the market

1051
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,359
class and that also didn't have the

1052
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,039
wealth or that can grow it in the winter

1053
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,639
so we were you know that communication

1054
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,719
wasn't happening there so when they had

1055
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,358
to select where to put their resources

1056
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,439
for good reasons they went into a

1057
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:30,039
different um crops and now do we have a

1058
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,200
much better understanding of what the

1059
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,960
farmers need in which locations and we

1060
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:36,480
communicate that early on in the season

1061
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,760
so at the end of our season say okay

1062
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,920
these were the farmers that were growing

1063
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,760
BT ekland this year and so these are the

1064
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,280
districts so we need seed for these many

1065
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,599
farmers in this area so I got a lot of

1066
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,599
having that communication thank

1067
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,039
you I have a question I was curious uh

1068
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,720
is the the cry one uh Jean carried in

1069
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,000
the pollen and and really the follow up

1070
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,118
on that is are are some of these Refuge

1071
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,519
plants are the seeds from them

1072
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,000
containing the uh that event that so it

1073
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:13,480
is cont U so the the question is about

1074
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,400
uh if the K1 seen is um is present in

1075
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,838
the pollen and if the Refuge that is

1076
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,760
around the field will have then we can

1077
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:26,519
um incorporate that Gene into it so

1078
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:30,599
there is a chance that that c1c will go

1079
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:32,159
into that neighboring egpl um I cannot

1080
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,880
remember exactly what is the distance

1081
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,318
but it's not a long distance where the

1082
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,559
pollen is moving and we and we have

1083
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:41,880
checked for that there's studies being

1084
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:43,519
done on that um Farmers uh that grow the

1085
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,358
the eggplant in the

1086
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,759
borders if they were to save seed again

1087
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:53,719
this would be just a one copy of that

1088
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,559
and that particular event um and so we

1089
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:57,679
are very much concerned with that

1090
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,440
movement of that polling when we talk

1091
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,879
about herbicide resist no and that's

1092
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,358
what we being very aware in this case

1093
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,200
that if the gene were to move the only

1094
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,920
thing we will do will make a resistant

1095
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:13,759
to the the P so Des by not something

1096
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,400
that we wanted to happen because they

1097
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:21,000
have that that the the the idea is that

1098
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,519
these um varieties of eggplant continue

1099
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,639
to be as indigenous as have they always

1100
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,480
been the worst cases scaros that will be

1101
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:33,679
resistant to the pest and will survive

1102
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,679
better remember is not fully

1103
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:42,240
over no it's like 10% exactly yes it is

1104
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,879
it has like a 10% cross pollination yeah

1105
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,959
yeah it's like yeah between 10 and 20%

1106
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,920
thank you for that Ronnie that was a

1107
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,358
really important

1108
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,000
point trying to let me stop share so

1109
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:58,400
it's easier for me to see it there we

1110
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,838
go oh Greg is here um

1111
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,480
what step do you recommend for a

1112
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,078
scientist that just discover a new

1113
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,440
controller strategy to deploy it as fast

1114
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,480
as possible um so that's a great

1115
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,599
question thank thanks Michael for that

1116
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,000
question so to me it is important that

1117
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,039
we understand uh how is this technology

1118
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,400
useful and communicate that early on not

1119
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:23,759
only to um you know your your colleagues

1120
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,160
collaborators make sure that you have a

1121
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,920
pretty uh diverse group of people in in

1122
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,558
your network so that you can move that

1123
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,480
technology you know work with your

1124
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,280
breeders work with your pathologist work

1125
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,838
your entomologist with a agronomist make

1126
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,920
sure that you understand the system

1127
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,880
where you want to deliver this

1128
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,200
technology um Talk early on I know that

1129
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,039
a lot of times we tend to be a little

1130
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:47,799
bit secretive because we're thinking

1131
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:49,838
that oh somebody can scoop me but if you

1132
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,599
don't talk about it you may not you may

1133
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,440
be missing an opportunity for

1134
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,280
utilization of this technology this is

1135
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,920
what is important that we communic early

1136
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,319
on but we also need to get a a group of

1137
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,838
sponsors for our research that

1138
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:06,159
understand where science fits in the

1139
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,920
field and communicate it's our job to

1140
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,598
communicate that to them to policy

1141
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,079
makers to donors to sponsors about where

1142
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,760
do we see this going and it's not like

1143
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,760
it's going to happen tomorrow it may be

1144
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,040
10 20 years down the pipeline but if we

1145
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,520
have a clear understanding of where the

1146
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,358
science can go and can communicate that

1147
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,239
effectively I think we can go a lot

1148
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,119
farther than we have gone before because

1149
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,479
a lot of times it starts with you know

1150
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,559
um it's not really an AA moment it's

1151
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,559
like hm that's funny moment no in the

1152
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,200
lab something that doesn't fit so the

1153
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,519
moment that something doesn't f you

1154
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,039
think you have something really good and

1155
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:42,119
start thinking what are the implications

1156
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,599
of this how can it be used um and to me

1157
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,640
like a lot of times we don't tend to

1158
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,760
think that big picture we get so focused

1159
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:50,879
especially in in grad school we're so

1160
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,800
focused on that particular example that

1161
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,599
pathway that Gene and that we forget

1162
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,119
that it belongs in a much larger

1163
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,240
environment I was talking to uh people

1164
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,160
that specialize in photosynthesis on MSU

1165
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,239
this this week and they were talking

1166
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:04,960
about what is that technologies that

1167
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,919
you're thinking about I'm like you guys

1168
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,838
work on photosynthesis you're not

1169
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,838
working on robiso we're still working on

1170
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:12,838
robiso you know it is the protein that

1171
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:15,279
has been studied so much and we still do

1172
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:17,119
not understand it of all the benefit and

1173
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,119
how we can make it more efficient Etc so

1174
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,640
like that we have so many systems that

1175
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,000
we do not understand because we haven't

1176
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,440
asked the big picture how does it fit

1177
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,679
with the rest so I think we just need to

1178
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,599
do more of that that's a perfect note to

1179
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,598
end on with thank you again

1180
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,400
you this has been a production of

1181
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,400
Cornell University on the web at

1182
