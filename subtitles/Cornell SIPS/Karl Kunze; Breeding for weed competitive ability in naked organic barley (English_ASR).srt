1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,138
all right good afternoon everyone um

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,240
today I'm gonna be talking about

5
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:18,489
greeting for weak competitive ability

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:21,129
and on naked organic cards so negative

7
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:24,129
aw what is naked barley on naked barley

8
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:26,229
is simply barley when harvested the hall

9
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:28,839
falls off the grain in a similar fashion

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,910
to week on we are currently bringing it

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,820
in the organic context and so we're

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,100
trying to develop on different ways to

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,960
evaluate it in New York State on three

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,260
methods that we're doing this is doing

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,359
acre grow outs for marketing on

16
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,748
diversity panels and our regional yield

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,039
child's which I'll go into more detail

18
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:50,140
some of the big challenges associated

19
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,469
with growing naked organic barley with

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,530
New York and crew food and Multan

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,899
Standards disease pressure and a lot of

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,299
agronomic pressures from New York State

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,609
environment and especially ones that are

24
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:07,060
relevant to organic conditions one an

25
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:10,420
important organic condition on factor is

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,820
we competitive ability or WCA we

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,129
competitive ability on it's defined as

28
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:17,709
an ability for a crop to tolerate or

29
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:20,769
out-compete on we pressure

30
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,799
weed pressure um it's a significant

31
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:25,780
problem in organic systems because on

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,539
obviously they don't have as much access

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,710
to herbicides and in addition for

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,400
evaluation experiments it's very

35
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:37,000
difficult

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,680
um to look at because weeds are very

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,810
nice are very influenced by the

38
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,430
environment and crop rotations so last

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,260
year we went about trying to develop

40
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,060
develop methods to evaluate we

41
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,580
competitive ability by looking at on

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,170
measurements of the weeds on by looking

43
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:56,530
at what kind of weeds were in the pots

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,439
on made a visual percentage estimation

45
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,120
did some weed counts and then did some

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,239
measurements of barley growth including

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,210
stain grunt stain counts early plant

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:12,519
height a visual barley percentage in our

49
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:14,859
categorical visual bigger ratings so

50
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,510
last year um I presented on this and

51
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,790
overall we didn't have a high

52
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,620
correlation yield we also had a

53
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:24,370
particularly rough environment

54
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,189
for growing barley on 2018 year and

55
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,640
while we did have some correlation for

56
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,829
the barley at mate 16 summate 29th we

57
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,039
determined that visual estimates and

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,349
categorical video of vigour ratings are

59
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:42,429
not quantitative enough to measure

60
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:44,409
barley grills so for this project we

61
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,540
turned to using kind of high-throughput

62
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:51,519
aerial imaging techniques to quantify

63
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:54,669
barley growth so aerial imaging from our

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,579
UAVs can measure multi spectral bands

65
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:58,689
that are reflected from the barley

66
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,000
particularly for our interest we're

67
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,909
focused on the near-infrared and

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,430
rhetoric wavelengths and finding the

69
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:09,459
differences over a ratio that is known

70
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,849
as normal differentiate vegetation index

71
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:16,569
and this can serve as a measurement of

72
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:18,729
vegetative biomass in a plot our aim is

73
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:20,768
if we can measure this growth and

74
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,419
measure the rate of growth it can

75
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,069
out-compete weeds early in the season

76
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,809
before the weeds can become more

77
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:30,548
established and then start competing

78
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,500
with the bark so on for the experiment

79
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,420
on the field design and management we

80
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,840
had two locations on free ville and

81
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,789
caldwell free ville is a with a much

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,189
more non-distressed ideal environment

83
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,979
for growing barley and the call location

84
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,379
had a lot more stress on there's 20

85
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:49,090
entries with three replications and a

86
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,789
randomized complete block design and

87
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,549
this for management on free Ville was

88
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:57,280
planted in April 23rd Caldwell in April

89
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,950
24th I'm grown under organic conditions

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,259
and one special thing that we did have

91
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,689
to do is that we did have to get rid of

92
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:07,149
the weeds in the plots on because if we

93
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:10,060
did not it would not be possible to

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,620
differentiate the NDVI between the weeds

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,348
in the barley on this field is the Colo

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,209
one as you can see there is significant

97
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:22,349
variation within this field particularly

98
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,530
among a row so

99
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,770
aerial image collection flights were

100
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:32,759
conducted using it make ascents red edge

101
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:34,829
camera using a DJI 100 drone on flights

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,879
were conducted 25 meters which gives a

103
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:40,979
resolution about 2 centimeters per pixel

104
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:44,610
for ground truth undie VI we used a

105
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,680
tremble green seeker and we used an r TK

106
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,460
system for therefore ground control

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,400
points per location the timeline for the

108
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,859
flights we conducted seven for each

109
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:58,849
location we started at about 30 days

110
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,580
after planting and ended about 70 on

111
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,500
images of the calibration of reflectance

112
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:07,259
panel were taken before and after each

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,879
flight and flights were conducted within

114
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:15,209
three hours a solution we got about 68

115
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,959
to 75 on images of 5 spectral bands of

116
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:21,689
per field on used AG to softpro stitch

117
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,589
the images together and then to extract

118
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,290
mean NDVI values i used on image read

119
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,079
developed by nick Morales on part of

120
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,090
green base and here you can see some of

121
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:38,029
the plot polygons that were undeveloped

122
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:40,319
on fer to the location of free fill so

123
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,669
overall for free Ville between the

124
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,550
correlation of ground truth valley

125
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,960
estate on aerial imaging failures the

126
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,910
correlations were quite high at the

127
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,000
beginning in the end but at the middle

128
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,560
on their quite low on two reasons for

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,350
this could be either on the there's some

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,620
error and my part of the measuring the

131
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,780
UAV gente VI on but in addition the

132
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,550
ground truth on green seeker can only

133
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,909
measure for two significant figures so

134
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,829
like point seven nine to 0.8 0.8 one so

135
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,360
it may have been not able to capture the

136
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,329
differences

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,580
however in Caldwell we had much higher

138
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,139
correlations and that might be due to

139
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,228
the contrast of the stressful

140
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,038
environment on that provided much more

141
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:27,688
accurate on correlations so on a free

142
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:32,068
build these are the distributions of the

143
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:34,490
NDVI values on green on is the aerial

144
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,870
imaging and blues the ground truth and

145
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,348
early in the season at free Ville the

146
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,959
the variation on decreased early early

147
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:45,978
in days after planting and then on kind

148
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,839
of a decrease and then increased again

149
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:51,689
hey Caldwell however there is much more

150
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:58,978
on even variation uses the stress and

151
00:06:51,689 --> 00:07:01,348
lack of nutrients on at Caldwell so on I

152
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:04,050
calculated heritability on for each time

153
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:06,750
point on at free ville I've I used this

154
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,150
model on the response at the NDVI value

155
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,079
just an intercept mean and a random

156
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:15,568
effector phenotype overall heritability

157
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,448
x' were high on with the exception in

158
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:21,750
this time point on in the middle of

159
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,210
planting and in calls well I use this

160
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,300
model with the only addition as I used a

161
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:28,348
fixed effector a row to account for the

162
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,379
significant row effect sigh mentioned

163
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:35,099
earlier and heritability Z were quite a

164
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:38,250
bit lower in terms of a

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,890
correlations to other traits on you

166
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,029
there's only about 0.5 to correlation

167
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,919
for the later on days after planting

168
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,359
heading date there was a correlation for

169
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,520
the early growth which would make sense

170
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,090
if you have higher vegetative growth

171
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,299
earlier on in the season on my head

172
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,349
heading date will be higher on

173
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,870
surprisingly there is no correlation

174
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,860
author for height that could be captured

175
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,720
by the aerial and on aerial imaging and

176
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,949
there were some correlation to disease

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,080
as a spot watch for Caldwell on there

178
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,589
was a significant on correlation for you

179
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:20,459
on heading date that was not not much on

180
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:22,279
in this system I the correlations were

181
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,289
able to capture height differences and

182
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:30,359
there was some correlation to spot watch

183
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,099
on in the future I hope to model this a

184
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,019
little bit more dynamically and

185
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,360
utilizing kind of growth for curve

186
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,569
functions per line across environments

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,599
I hope the work on miles addressing the

188
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,180
spatial variability in the field um hope

189
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,910
to develop prediction models for some of

190
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:50,099
these traits and then hopefully use

191
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,919
these models by such for potential

192
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,470
selection and I would like to thank

193
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,169
everyone on to help me out with this

194
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,769
committee members mark Gary and Sam of

195
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:03,659
everyone the lab group special thanks to

196
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,240
everyone with helping me with aerial

197
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,909
imaging um I was learning how to do that

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:15,539
including Margaret on Nick all three

199
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:18,259
nights and of course a Jannik lab group

200
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,259
in synapses

201
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:27,740
[Applause]

202
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:30,799
so it's part of what you're getting

203
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,680
after is is you know competitiveness

204
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,109
with weeds yep why did you choose in DVI

205
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,559
versus looking at like fine hyper or

206
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:45,440
canopy coverage as your phenotype

207
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:48,319
so um hmm NDVI seemed like it would be

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,510
the best way to kind of capture the

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,650
canopy coverage but um I'd realized

210
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,069
there might be models that might be

211
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,779
better for that but on how I hide

212
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,210
something we thought we could put in the

213
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,279
model but I doesn't like measures last

214
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,490
year didn't seem to capture that as much

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,470
so we're hoping that it like on NDVI

216
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,389
would capture more like a wide leaf

217
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:27,410
angle so to speak if the parlays to

218
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:29,059
capture that there can be but it's very

219
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,189
still even then it's still very

220
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,929
difficult to measure because on there

221
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,660
might be we distributions but yeah

222
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:37,879
they're not they're much more located

223
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:39,289
with respect to the field like last year

224
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,429
you'll have a certain corner of the

225
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,049
field that has a certain kind of weed

226
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:44,599
and then another they'll have another

227
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:48,109
fight it's just very difficult to

228
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,580
control for what kind of weeds on pop up

229
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,649
in the certain areas but Carl do you

230
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,379
have notes on - there's two main growth

231
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,819
evidence for early prostrate and erect

232
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,490
so there's something like really light

233
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,200
on the ground for a long time of it or

234
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:10,039
there a break the whole way you have

235
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,990
notes on that yes and all dan asked if I

236
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,659
have a notes on prostate versus direct

237
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,200
on yes and currently there's only really

238
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:22,429
one line that is that is like is not

239
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,140
erect its prostrate on so yeah I do and

240
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:28,909
I didn't find a significant difference

241
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:33,519
with those either the rate of growth

242
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:33,519
early on so a lot of competing

243
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:42,409
to rapid growth mm-hmm nation is that a

244
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:45,319
trait sure um yeah hopefully next year

245
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:47,569
um we I hope to aim to do this as soon

246
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,540
as it's planted and look at even earlier

247
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,010
stages but on in developing this

248
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,099
protocol is a learning process

249
00:11:52,009 --> 00:12:04,069
I'm do imaging when should we start when

250
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:05,960
should we finish ship its what was the

251
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,900
nature of the stress between the two

252
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,090
locations and was it intentional it was

253
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,329
not intentional on that's what came out

254
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,850
of sales that's why it isn't not

255
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,790
intentional in that but these are how

256
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,649
organic fields can be put on probably

257
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:23,209
the most the most probable cause for the

258
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,309
stress is probably nutrient availability

259
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,280
I mean these were playing at the same

260
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,869
time on so it was you know it's probably

261
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,519
nutrient availability at the couple

262
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:39,080
location I haven't gotten into that yet

263
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,870
but I would like to alright if there are

264
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,950
no more questions or sumn please join me

265
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,950
one more time and thanking Carla
