1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,000
University all right good afternoon so

3
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,358
my name is Aaron mcken and it's great to

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,960
see so many familiar faces um for the

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,560
last year and a half i' have I've had

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,240
the pleasure of being a grad student in

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,038
the horiculture department and working

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,959
very closely also with Cornell

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,439
plantations and their

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,000
staff so I really gravitated to public

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,679
Horticulture because of a love of plants

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,878
and for me public Horticulture really

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,878
brings together how plants can be used

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:43,000
to serve ecological communities and

15
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,679
human communities alike um and so when I

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,600
Was preparing for this presentation I

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,519
was kind of asking myself why why

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,960
marketing why did you choose this topic

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,320
and what makes it exciting about public

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,719
Horticulture and you guys might be

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,439
wondering that as well but for me

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,760
basically um I felt that this there was

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:05,399
a kind of a gap in here um in terms of

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,478
the collaborative aspects of public of

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,118
public marketing um and I felt that by

26
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,039
gaining expertise in this um and

27
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,560
coupling that with my passion for plants

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,400
that I would be able to fill a niche

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,079
when I go and seek a career after this

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,880
master's program is over so today I'm

31
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,158
going to share with you um some of the

32
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,959
results from my research while I've been

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,159
a graduate student and so just to put it

34
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,118
in context kind of

35
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,680
increasingly um in an increasingly

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,239
competitive Marketplace public

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,240
Horticulture institutions have um

38
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,118
started joining together with other arts

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,199
and culture organizations in their area

40
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,519
to create what is called a public or a

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,320
collaborative Marketing Group which I'm

42
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,319
going to shorten and say CMG which I

43
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,599
think you guys will all enjoy hearing

44
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,718
better than the mouthful of

45
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,798
collaborative Marketing Group so

46
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,959
synonymously we'll use those so in this

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,799
increasingly competitive Marketplace um

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,239
um the collaborative marketing groups

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,680
have enabled Gardens and other

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:09,159
organizations to reduce their marketing

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,280
costs and also tap into customer

52
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,239
expertise um and furthermore this

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,640
collaboration is a strategy for

54
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,200
maximizing the potential of marketing

55
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,719
and better addressing um the concept of

56
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,000
destination

57
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,598
marketing so this project directly

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,840
addressed the knowledge Gap in the field

59
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,119
of public Horticulture related to these

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,479
strategies um collaborative Partnerships

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,599
are socially contrived mechanisms for

62
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,039
Collective action a CMG is a venture

63
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,799
shared between a group of associated

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,000
organizations that aims to um obtain

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,920
greater recognition resources and

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,239
results for those organizations when

67
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
compared to those individual

68
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,560
organizations working

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,158
alone so CMG efforts specifically aim to

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,199
increase the success of these

71
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,199
organizations as they engage in

72
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,199
collaborative problem solving and they

73
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,839
also create a platform for information

74
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,839
Exchange

75
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:07,000
so the core research question was are

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,439
collaborative marketing groups an

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,560
effective way for par Public Gardens to

78
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,359
Market their mission to Their audience

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,319
and then uh sequentially I also asked

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,280
what were the motivations in conditions

81
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,839
for that Garden to join what were some

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
of the Key activities and best

83
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,000
management practices being uh that were

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,439
outcomes of the CMG and then what were

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,400
the most valued outcomes both monetary

86
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,400
and non-monetary

87
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,798
the methods that I used to kind of

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,120
obtain this data were um in two sections

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,959
and the first was interviews with five

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
case study Gardens um and key marketing

91
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,598
staff at those

92
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,200
Gardens and the second was an electronic

93
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:52,598
survey and so of the 30 Gardens that I

94
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,318
sent the survey to 25 completed it so as

95
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,959
a return rate it was pretty good and it

96
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,958
was such a small sample size because

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
each of these Gardens were participating

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,519
in a collaborative Marketing Group so

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,280
that was kind of like the key factor in

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,360
them getting the survey to begin with so

101
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,878
the survey asked about the garden

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,079
satisfaction with their CMG performance

103
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,919
and it also designed to was designed to

104
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,760
answer the core research

105
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,839
questions the interviews were the

106
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,519
purpose of those W um were basically to

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,119
understand the current practices being

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,079
employed by these cmgs at Public Gardens

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,720
and um that interview was conducted in

110
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,719
two sections so the first section was

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,039
using the business model generation

112
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,320
canvas which I recognize that this you

113
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,120
may not be able to see each of the

114
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:41,319
headers but this is a visual way of

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,120
laying out a business model and I have

116
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,478
basically the experience of using this

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,600
is you bring a big like 6x5 version of

118
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,319
this into a a a room where you have

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,720
sharehold or stakeholders in the

120
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,719
conversation and then we use Post-it

121
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,479
notes and kind of dialogue to then

122
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,680
populate each area so it's a way of

123
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,399
visually representing the business

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
business model and outlining you know

125
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,758
what is the what is the value

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
proposition or the mission of the garden

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,479
who are their customers Their audience

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
and then what are the channels that they

129
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,319
reach reach that audience with so so on

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
and so forth and then when we got to the

131
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,240
section of key Partners we turned to the

132
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,360
conversation to ask how does the

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,680
CMG basically open up new channels or

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,600
provide Key activities or key resources

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,720
for them to achieve their mission which

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,919
in nonprofit horiculture is Paramount

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,120
achieving the missions so this is just

138
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,680
kind of here for um a visual aid but if

139
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,478
anybody's interested in learning more

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,560
about the canvas and the business model

141
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,719
generation handbook I'd talk to you

142
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,680
about that later and could provide more

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
resources so I'm going to go through

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,959
each of the five case study interviews

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,120
now and basically the second part of the

146
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,279
interview which I I failed to comment on

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,918
was a series of open-ended questions and

148
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,478
so the summary of each interview I'm

149
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,560
about to provide is the canvas and that

150
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,758
that the open-ended questions so really

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,759
it was obviously a qualitative analysis

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,479
and um we had a lot of fun while we were

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,280
doing it and it was reciprocal the

154
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:12,439
gardens gained a lot out of that process

155
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,159
of going through the canvas and then I

156
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,918
gained quite a bit of information as

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
well so my first interview was with

158
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,159
Cornell plantations right here in itha

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,400
and they are part of a collaborative

160
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,520
effort of local cultural institutions

161
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,079
called The Discovery Trail which many of

162
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,918
you hopefully are aware of Discovery

163
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,279
Trail partnership is a group of

164
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,318
nonprofit organizations based here that

165
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,839
promote the awareness and understanding

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,479
of connections of the connections

167
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,719
between art History Literature science

168
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,159
and the natural

169
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,759
world the goal of the discovery Trail is

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,960
to collectively Market the member

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,199
organizations to tourists that are over

172
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,120
90 miles away and so this is a region

173
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,079
which Cornell plant that that tourist

174
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,120
audience is a region that's a little bit

175
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,680
less attainable for Gardens specifically

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,560
Cornell plantations to put M valuable

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,160
marketing resources too so Discovery

178
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,478
Trail really AIDS in in um in

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,280
compensating for that in a way so

180
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,560
Discovery Trail is supported by annual

181
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,839
membership dues as well as through the

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,160
Strategic tourism the Tomkins County

183
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,679
strategic tourism board and again I'm

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll mention its um main function is to

185
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,240
increase public awareness and positively

186
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,959
impact the visitation of each of the

187
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,560
member member organizations to Discovery

188
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,038
Trail so it one of the things that has

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,959
evolved out of this successful

190
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,279
partnership um over time is an

191
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,239
educational program called kids kids

192
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,359
discover the trail and so this was kind

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,560
of a learning moment in you know even

194
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,439
just the first interview where I

195
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,519
realized that the the longevity or the

196
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,079
age of a collaborative Marketing Group

197
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:54,279
influenced the level of their activity

198
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:57,399
so for example Discovery Trail once they

199
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,279
became more seasoned decided to create

200
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,679
and um evolve or basically

201
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,279
formalize this educational program

202
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,800
through their through their um shared

203
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,318
kind of

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,639
collaboration um and I'll come back to

205
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,960
that point later in the outcomes so

206
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,158
other non-m manitary B uh benefits of

207
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,399
the discovery Trail for plantations

208
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,959
include strengthening their branded

209
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,399
cultural identity of itha so really

210
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,839
creating more of a destination marketing

211
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,560
um brand here in itha for for people

212
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,959
that aren't living here to when they

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,959
come visit they can really identify

214
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,319
with what there is to do when you visit

215
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,759
and then top of Mind awareness in

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,479
potential customer audience's mind so

217
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,838
that goes for both Regional people that

218
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
live here and then people that are

219
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
visiting um creating that top of mine

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,839
awareness my second interview is with

221
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Garden in the woods which is

222
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,760
headquartered which is the headquarters

223
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,039
for New England Wildflower society and

224
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,799
the Massachusetts Garden botanic garden

225
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,639
group was established in 2012 to better

226
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,399
leverage um the various Public Gardens

227
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,078
throughout the state of

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,078
Massachusetts and so this was created by

229
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,159
the recommendation of the Massachusetts

230
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:10,039
office of travel and tourism so there

231
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,360
was actually an outside you know body

232
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,199
saying you all you Gardens need to get

233
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,399
together and create this and they also

234
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,120
felt that strength and numbers would

235
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,039
really enable them to um increase

236
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,320
audience awareness of the 11

237
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,559
participating Gardens and make kind of a

238
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,959
viable and robust Partnership if they if

239
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,639
they join together so the CMG is still

240
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,239
in the early early stages of its

241
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,919
development but it's already impacted

242
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,159
how New England Wildflower Society

243
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,199
thinks about marketing um it's funded

244
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,958
through member dues

245
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,920
and as well as um they're able to gain

246
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,078
uh financial support from convention and

247
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,719
visitors bureaus and the Massachusetts

248
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,239
office of travel and tourism so that's

249
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,000
that's funding that they wouldn't have

250
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,399
access to if they weren't collaborating

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,799
it's another another kind of key

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,799
outcome so this this CMG provides a

253
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,799
really key marketing channel and the

254
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,519
vehicle for that is a shared website and

255
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,199
that's a that's been a common theme so

256
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,519
these cmgs create websites to

257
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,680
collectively tell what's going on so

258
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,039
whether that's through an events

259
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,278
calendar or just simply through creating

260
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:20,360
links to their websites this is a way to

261
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,399
achieve a more Dynamic marketing mix for

262
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,320
Gardens that a lot of times don't have a

263
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,000
very very substantial marketing budget

264
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,360
so furthermore the CMG strengthens New

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
England Wildflower society's

266
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,079
relationship with their peer Gardens and

267
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
it really does enfor reinforce that um

268
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,120
climate for knowledge sharing among

269
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,519
professionals um so much in nonprofit

270
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,919
Horticulture or you know any nonprofit

271
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,919
field there are various people working

272
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,519
in the same positions trying to achieve

273
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,639
the same goals and so if we can share

274
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,278
kind of day-to-day you know knowledge

275
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,159
about day-to-day activities about how to

276
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,078
best achieve you know the promotion of

277
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,958
these individual organizations that

278
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,519
basically is what the CMG is able to

279
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,638
formalize the process

280
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,560
of so Chicago Botanic Garden was my

281
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,799
third interview and destination

282
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:12,278
marketing is kind of an ever important

283
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,799
um strategy for nonprofit Gardens to use

284
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:18,559
so increasing in order to increase their

285
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:22,039
visitation and attendance du North is

286
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,719
the collaborative that Chicago um is a

287
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,958
part of and these

288
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,879
organizations have joined forces to kind

289
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,039
of like bring attention to the do the

290
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,919
North Shore region which is 40 minutes

291
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,519
north of downtown Chicago and so the

292
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,838
reason why this is significant is

293
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
because you know people go to Chicago to

294
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
go to downtown but they don't

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,879
necessarily know what's going on in that

296
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,278
in that neighborhood up there and so

297
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,200
there is a wealth of cultural

298
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,399
organizations there and they've decided

299
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,360
to join together to cross program and

300
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,480
cross market so the interview with

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,039
Chicago Botanic Garden revealed that du

302
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,560
North has not just an economic impact on

303
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,360
the garden but but also on the region as

304
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,719
a whole um by attracting tourists to

305
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
that area so in addition to this

306
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,399
destination marketing strategy um the

307
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,278
collaborative also impacts um their

308
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
bottom line by appealing to a few key

309
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,399
donors and this was also kind of a big

310
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,759
realization from this interview and the

311
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,839
one that I'll talk about next so people

312
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,679
that give large um large contributions

313
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,199
to Gardens then want to have some

314
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,399
involvement in in the decision- making

315
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,399
and kind of the the future of how that

316
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,240
is going to be portrayed to its audience

317
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,679
and so the staff at the Chicago Botanic

318
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Garden really felt that they were

319
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,198
serving this key these key donor wishes

320
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,600
by demonstrating that they're using

321
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,639
their philanthropic um contributions in

322
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,800
a in an effective way by collaborating

323
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,519
with these other organizations and

324
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,120
basically creating a brand to promote

325
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,198
the whole area not just their Garden so

326
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,440
the public response also has been very

327
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:58,599
positive to the do North collaborative

328
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,920
because they like seeing the

329
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,399
organization in their area work

330
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,719
collaboratively so that brings me to

331
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,320
redb Garden in Salt Lake City which is

332
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,199
part of a a CMG called Foothill Cultural

333
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,120
District which is comprised of seven

334
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:19,759
destinations along Salt Lake City's B um

335
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,560
Foothill Boulevard the mission of this

336
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,480
Marketing Group is to provide visitors

337
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,399
with the opportunity to experience

338
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,839
Utah's fascinating art culture history

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,320
and stunning natural areas um in an

340
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,600
easily accessible way and using public

341
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,680
transportation so the Foothills Cultural

342
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,959
District also was really um created

343
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,239
because of the vision of a local

344
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,638
philanthropist Zeke dumpy who also gave

345
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,480
significant contributions to the Garden

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,919
um and has like you know like a building

347
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,079
named after him and things like this so

348
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,000
he's like one of their key donors and

349
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,399
really important and he said to them and

350
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,399
the other organizations he said hey I

351
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,799
give to all of you individually I really

352
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,320
want you all to work together and so

353
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,159
they you know they through they did some

354
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,199
trialing and some piloting of those that

355
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:08,120
program and then it it basically was

356
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:10,639
formalized in 2004 and some of their um

357
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,078
some of the key key resources that comes

358
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,680
out of this collaborative Marketing

359
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,319
Group is they really can Leverage The

360
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,919
collaboration when they're applying for

361
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,600
Grants um so they end up acquiring funds

362
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,958
because they state that they're in

363
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,278
collaboration with these other

364
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,319
organizations and they're also part of a

365
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,360
cultural tax District that you know

366
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,920
looks favorably upon their their

367
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,919
collaborative

368
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,799
efforts so this culture of collaboration

369
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,519
also creates the perception that redb

370
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,120
and the other member Gardens are

371
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,679
Community Players um and so again this

372
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,519
is kind of evolved in the direction of

373
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,919
more shared programming and it's not

374
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:53,198
just it's no longer just a marketing

375
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,439
platform so my final interview was um at

376
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,838
the Scott Arboretum in Media

377
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,079
Pennsylvania and if anybody's been to

378
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,279
the Philly area you know that that area

379
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,039
is rich in Botanical Gardens and

380
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,799
arborita and um the Scott ARB burum is

381
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,039
unique they're part of um two separate

382
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,479
collaborative marketing groups and the

383
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,278
first one I'm going to comment on is

384
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,519
called Greater Philadelphia Gardens and

385
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,919
that is the oldest collaborative that I

386
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,360
interviewed and it's comprised of 30

387
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,838
member Gardens in a 30 mile radius of

388
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,159
Philadelphia so that's a high density of

389
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,600
Gardens and that Regional proximity was

390
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,600
kind of the basic for why they created

391
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,319
the collaborative back in the 80s but it

392
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,159
also then evolved because um you know it

393
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:42,318
creates this knowledge sharing among

394
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,399
Gardens as as I've mentioned before so

395
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,879
some of the Key activities of Greater

396
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,519
Philadelphia Gardens is that they work

397
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,838
to promote the member

398
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,560
Gardens across the board so some of the

399
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,839
members in that CMG are like really

400
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,000
well-known Gardens for example Longwood

401
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,839
which probably many of you have heard of

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,399
but then there's other which are lesser

403
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,680
known um and so the benefit that each of

404
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,679
these members are afforded is that their

405
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:13,078
reputation is extended by way of being

406
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:16,958
associated with these other bigger

407
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,519
Gardens so another really key activity

408
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,479
is that um that the pooling of those

409
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,519
resources enables Greater Philadelphia

410
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,759
Gardens to Market to an

411
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,879
international audience and so what I

412
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,360
want to give um just a moment to recog

413
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,159
recognizes that like I didn't interview

414
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,800
them but the bartrums garden is really

415
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,559
small that has huge historic

416
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,958
significance and their visitation levels

417
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,000
are like low and just like every like

418
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,439
many nonprofit Gardens you know has

419
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,440
struggled financially but what they've

420
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,120
tracked through Google analytics and

421
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,920
through their attendance is that because

422
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,198
of Greater Philadelphia Gardens

423
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,919
marketing to an international audience

424
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:59,639
they get tons of international visitors

425
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,879
and it's they couldn't pay to Market the

426
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,600
way that Greater Philadelphia Gardens is

427
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,599
is marketing for them if that makes

428
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,199
sense so that was just a really key key

429
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,000
um learning from my interview with them

430
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,640
so the second partnership that I'd like

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,759
to just talk about briefly with the Scot

432
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,439
AR redom is one that's more web- based

433
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,240
it's called the Delaware County Arts

434
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,558
Consortium and they are focused on a web

435
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,838
platform and calendar events calendar

436
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:27,759
called greater uh the Philly fund guide

437
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,720
and basically it's it's a way for the

438
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,279
Scott Arboretum to Market to people

439
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,000
regionally because even though you're

440
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,798
seated in a community and you think have

441
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,960
a you have a good handle on how to best

442
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,759
access people in your community there's

443
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,919
always there's always um new ways to

444
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,119
reach them and so this website really

445
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,038
enables um Scott the Scott ARB burum to

446
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,000
reach a local audience that they

447
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:54,160
previously didn't know how to so the

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,960
conditions for joining um are we're kind

449
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,320
of really a big key Focus for this study

450
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,880
and by definition collaboration requires

451
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:05,038
that a certain amount of autonomy is

452
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,840
kind of is sacri is is sacrificed by the

453
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,879
garden so they have to work together in

454
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,759
order to and put their their own

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,600
objectives kind of on the side so what's

456
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,038
really key before starting to create a

457
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,199
collaborative or deciding if you want to

458
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,000
join one would be that you know you want

459
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,480
to understand the institutional factors

460
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,240
of the other organizations that you're

461
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,360
joining in you want to understand the

462
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,960
culture and the um organizational goals

463
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,719
and then secondarily a a major theme was

464
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,840
that nonprofit leaders whether they be

465
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,679
executive directors or key donors were a

466
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,839
huge influential motivation for why a

467
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,798
garden would join um existing n network

468
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,798
and Regional proximity also greatly

469
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,119
influenc the likelihood of a

470
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,038
collaborative um either being created or

471
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,359
someone deciding to

472
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,798
join so just to share some of the

473
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,798
results of the electronic survey um the

474
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,839
motivation to collaborate must be based

475
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:03,759
on the CM 's ability to kind of attain

476
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,879
outcomes that the garden couldn't

477
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,000
achieve on its own so the survey

478
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,600
respondents basically stated that this

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,038
was a strategic decision for them and

480
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,639
that um joining the collaboration was

481
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,440
really like Paramount was that they

482
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,520
wanted to join together with the other

483
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,798
arts and culture organizations to create

484
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,759
that strength and numbers

485
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,599
concept and then moving into audience

486
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,519
which we've talked about before but

487
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,199
really accessing a wider tourist

488
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,038
audience through shared marketing

489
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,080
activities was another major priority um

490
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,240
for these

491
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,918
Gardens cmgs helped to establish kind of

492
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,279
transactional relationships with

493
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,880
visitors but this the research was not

494
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,759
showing that anything beyond a

495
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,720
transactional relationship was created

496
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,279
so what I mean by that is people found

497
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,919
out about the Garden or the

498
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,480
organizations in the area and they went

499
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,280
and visited but they didn't necessarily

500
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,400
buy a membership or become donors um and

501
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,558
so that a way that when you deepen the

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,440
programmatic involvement by creating

503
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,798
something like kids discover the trail

504
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,159
you can start to draw in uh more of a

505
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,359
relational um relationship with that

506
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,600
audience so some of the Key activities

507
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,279
were shared visibility and the vehicle

508
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,439
for that was oftentimes a website and

509
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,798
then just creating an economy of scale

510
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,960
for these Gardens to promote their

511
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,200
Garden through a website and lessen the

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,480
individual marketing costs that was a

513
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,000
major driving force

514
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,720
and furthermore the um interviews backed

515
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,119
up that the CMG opened up new channels

516
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,440
so they were actually able to access new

517
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,558
customers or audience that wasn't

518
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,919
previously kind of available to them

519
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:45,279
through the

520
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,000
collaborative and lastly um from the

521
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,759
electronic survey the respondents

522
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,839
answered that the most valuable outcomes

523
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,558
was increased publicity and visibility

524
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:56,119
of their Garden um Gardens indicated

525
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,599
that the CMG had improved relations with

526
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,839
regional cultural in institutions

527
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,240
because it facilitated and formalized

528
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,480
Partnerships and collaborations that

529
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,839
were already happening and so they were

530
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,279
now given you know they were given

531
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,678
permission in a way to and given you

532
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,599
know a platform to stand on in order to

533
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,120
to collaborate with one

534
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,719
another so across all interviews the

535
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,519
larger the garden and the more

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
established the collaborative Marketing

537
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,639
Group the more concrete the contributors

538
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,880
or my interviewees were on why their

539
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Garden was involved and so I guess that

540
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,440
kind of goes with without saying but it

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,679
was still interesting um to kind of look

542
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,440
at collaboratives that were anywhere

543
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,640
from devel starting founded in 1980s all

544
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,400
the way up to 2012 um and so each

545
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,440
interviewee really highly valued the

546
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,480
triple bottom line Theory which really

547
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,038
takes into account and adds value to

548
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,558
Social Capital reputation awareness

549
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,960
building as viable outcomes of the

550
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:58,240
collaborative um so more more

551
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,440
performance evaluation is needed uh you

552
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,440
can't just say yes we're you know we're

553
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,440
having we have these non-monetary

554
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,919
outcomes and they're really good I mean

555
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,919
it's good to have a solid understanding

556
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,559
of that but more benchmarking would

557
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,720
definitely benefit um leaders in terms

558
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,639
of decision-making and validating their

559
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,640
their involvement in

560
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,320
this and so in conclusion um

561
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,000
collaborative marketing groups proved to

562
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,639
be a really effective way for

563
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,038
organizations to work in concert to

564
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,840
achieve Lar larger scale advertising

565
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:35,519
while saving money and

566
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:38,079
resources um they provide a solution to

567
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,359
align media and publicity expenditures

568
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,678
and help to stretch individual budgets

569
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,558
while diversifying the marketing mix of

570
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,519
individual gu individual

571
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,678
organizations having a better

572
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,759
understanding of the benefits of a CMG

573
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,159
would enable public garden leaders to

574
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,240
comprehend the value of collaboration

575
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,159
and justify the resources and staff time

576
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,960
that they allocate to it furthermore um

577
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,760
in improved forecasting would definitely

578
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,079
help to help them to make informed um

579
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,599
decisions so ideally the findings from

580
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,720
this study will and the use of the BMG

581
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:16,599
canvas and future research will help to

582
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,600
um provide knowledge that is required to

583
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:22,199
successfully engage in these formal

584
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:25,119
collaborations so I just want to thank

585
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,640
the um professors my advisers and

586
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,959
committee members the fellow public

587
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,200
garden leadership student

588
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,890
students and all of you for listening

589
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:40,969
today thank you very

590
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:40,969
[Applause]

591
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,200
much question um well that's where

592
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,200
social reputation really comes into play

593
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,558
and as you know when the when community

594
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,080
members or members of these these

595
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:58,678
organizations view that large garden as

596
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,599
um being philanthropic themselves in

597
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,278
sharing their brand and sharing their um

598
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,759
reputation that's kind of where they

599
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,319
gain the benefit and so yeah it's really

600
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:13,278
in in the nonprofit field you can kind

601
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:14,639
of create things based on non-monetary I

602
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,119
don't I don't really know how to answer

603
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,440
this question but basically they gain a

604
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,079
an improved reputation from it and this

605
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,519
can this this happens more often in a

606
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:29,000
nonprofit scenario does that help to

607
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:32,158
answer any other questions

608
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,159
okay thank
