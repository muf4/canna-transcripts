1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,559
University thank you very much Adam for

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:15,480
the kind introduction and uh um I have

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,160
never been

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,880
Etha and it's a place that every plant

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,000
scientist want to be and want to visit

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:28,839
right at least so dream come true so

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,118
here why there's two screen oh okay all

9
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,960
right okay uh tell you maybe you haven't

10
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:39,359
heard there's um this is being remotely

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,960
okay and video so um remote screen okay

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,960
all right okay so today I'm going to

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,520
talk about three uh aspect of uh my

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,239
research here and one is the center for

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,000
PL transformation at Iowa State

16
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,919
University which is basically service

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,878
center and then my research aspect in

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,840
the agrobacteria and as well as uh nanop

19
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:07,280
particle um delivery uh non DNA molecule

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,400
delivery in plant so um a lot of stuff

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,960
there and then there's a few slides I

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,320
maybe rush through and I apolog

23
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,798
apologize for that if uh you get

24
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,679
confused of uh stuff so first of all

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,960
talking about the plant transformation

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,680
facility at Iowa State University which

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:32,158
was established 20 years ago um 1995 I

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,079
um left my indust indry job where um I

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,719
used to be colleague with Jos Rose so um

30
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:42,599
and from ICI gust and mve to Iowa State

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:46,200
University take a position to run a PL

32
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,199
transformation facility um that time the

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,040
facility was uh basically was supported

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,200
by endowment uh Grant from Agronomy uh

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,039
and then the commodity Group which

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,879
heavily behind that and then also from

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,159
administrative uh um unit of uh uh cows

38
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,718
and plant biotechnology it's very

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,118
similar situation like today that we're

40
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:13,079
been talking

41
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:15,919
about so currently um we have five

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,040
permanent staff and I cannot four times

43
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,079
staff here

44
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:24,639
um we have Coe transformation specialist

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,599
soring transformation specialist rice

46
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,399
transformation specialist and they all

47
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,598
one person start from a the very

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,959
beginning to to the end of the entire

49
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:37,959
pipeline um they do not have hourly

50
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,360
students they work everything Al just

51
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,878
simple one person project then we have a

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,519
lab manager who does some molecular

53
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,000
biology work and then we have a

54
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,200
greenhouse dedicated Greenhouse manager

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,560
who do nothing but taking care of a core

56
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:59,439
and sing and rice count so this together

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,519
with myself we um run the the um the the

58
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,239
co and sving transformation we have only

59
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,519
three crop focused a very focused

60
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,560
project on that

61
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:14,719
um our transformation facility is under

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,640
a plant Science Institute which is a

63
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,359
umbrella Institute uh covers the

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,158
following centers uh genomics

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,120
bioinformatics um plant transformation

66
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:30,359
breeding and and the other few two uh

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
centers so we operate somewhat auton

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,000
autonomous but same time we get support

69
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,438
from PL Science

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,080
Institute and then we also Under the

71
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:42,680
Umbrella of the office of biotechnology

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,439
which runs all the infrastructure and

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,719
the centralizing um uh the facility

74
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:53,318
genomic informatics Frost hometry

75
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,759
hyoma um microscope Nano image and all

76
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,318
these things are very similar to here so

77
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:03,120
there's a we are the one of the 12 core

78
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:07,280
facility so this two unit support uh

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,799
collectively one fulltime um one

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,400
FTE here so over the past 20 years um we

81
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:20,439
have served 35 internal crop group and

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,240
basically cor soing R uh um uh faculty

83
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,079
researchers and then we have 161

84
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,800
external groups from 121 institution

85
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,680
institution from 16 countries so

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,319
basically everybody who does corn and

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,038
sorbing not rice rice a lot of people

88
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,199
can do themselves corn and sorbing come

89
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:43,439
to our facility majority at least 70 to

90
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,520
80% of the research in the field does

91
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:51,079
that from a uh receive service from us

92
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,599
so here is a summary of the growth all

93
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,639
our capacity to the other uh on the

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,639
other hand uh of over the year of our

95
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,160
growth and as you can see at the

96
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,439
beginning we creeping through all the

97
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,439
numbers and we didn't know we didn't

98
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,879
know anybody and then nobody knows us

99
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,120
and then after all these years and then

100
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:13,199
we are reaching really our capacity for

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,639
three staff member of course we can add

102
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,199
more people if they um but the cost we

103
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,960
want to keep down is we keep really

104
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,919
quality staff our staff are really very

105
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:30,198
experienced they are PhD level of uh um

106
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:33,038
uh scientist and then so they provide

107
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,160
service they at same time they always

108
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:40,519
tweaking the conditions always comparing

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,680
different um uh parameters so for here

110
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:46,038
the home transformation just shows how

111
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,038
uh the plant in our Greenhouse look like

112
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,959
and I really admire um connell's

113
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,879
Greenhouse crew uh this afternoon I to

114
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,478
the greenhouse I

115
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,560
just I can't say enough of good things

116
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,079
about it's just so clean and so well

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,519
organized and then you have those

118
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,879
incubator was 60

119
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,079
70 uh uh 1970s vintage and they well

120
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,639
well kept which means that this well

121
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,879
it's a very energy costing unit but they

122
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,360
are so well maintain uh you know lot of

123
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,519
unit lot of U institution you will see

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,960
instrument cannot keep more than 5 years

125
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,000
because nobody take care of them they

126
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:32,799
just get you know rotten and then be

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,959
abused by the student and all the things

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
but here it's a really amazing

129
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,000
infrastructure for the growth and uh

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,720
really

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,800
great so we do two type of uh M

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,800
transformation and then High 2 and then

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,360
b14 High two is a lab line and then

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,879
which is not very good for um agronomic

135
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,759
purpose but it's uh good enough for

136
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,039
study some basic things and then

137
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,680
transformation is easy that's why uh k 2

138
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,079
has been a working horse in our lab and

139
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,840
then but later on we were able to get

140
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:14,359
B104 transformation then b14 is a quite

141
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:17,359
good inbr and it's a a major uh inbr um

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,280
based on b73 so a lot of genomics can be

143
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,240
done with this um b14 however the

144
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:28,318
transformation frequency for these two

145
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,680
crops varies a lot uh which hand the

146
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,520
cause the difference in in the price as

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,319
well so when sometime uh The Faculty

148
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,680
like to use b14 for transformation but

149
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,360
the pricewise they couldn't afford and

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,280
that's one of the another things when

151
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,000
you are working with very concentr crop

152
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:52,158
and sometime and you have to face the

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,879
price issue for soing transformation and

154
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:58,439
the half seat method was actually

155
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,599
invented during the time when I uh after

156
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,319
the um uh arrived Iowa State University

157
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:09,079
and serving transformation patent has

158
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,800
been um uh established long time in the

159
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,800
late 80s but you know still very very

160
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,120
low frequency and very difficult to

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,520
transfer technique to the other person

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,918
um you have to be really well vered with

163
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,359
cell biology in order to run it so um my

164
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,680
effort uh this invention particularly is

165
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,680
skill transfer friendly means that you

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,000
know some of those basic uh knowledge uh

167
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,399
if the high school student was able to

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,918
uh understand the protocol and do

169
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,759
exactly what was demonstrated they are

170
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:49,360
able to achieve transic sorbing so the

171
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:51,439
skill um is not really quite uh the

172
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
important for the people to have so

173
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
that's very important if you want to

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,839
have your technology um expanded and

175
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,360
then be Ben benefiting uh more than only

176
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,600
just one your lab and so Sor

177
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,480
transformation we uh have this protocol

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,879
and the

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,639
um it's working very well but it's a

180
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,159
very toour capacity so then finally it's

181
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,120
a rise transformation which we uh

182
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,319
basically do

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,720
the Japonica rice transformation both

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,120
the bombe and then kataki using the

185
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,399
pretty standard and public uh protocol

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,759
and works very well but I think the rice

187
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,320
is not as difficult compared to recant

188
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,799
CH and sorbing here and most people can

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,760
actually establish for themselves so

190
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,639
what is a key limitation with our

191
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:51,000
facility after 10 20 years of working on

192
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,720
uh this service facility and I would say

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,639
first of all is the lack of our

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,879
Greenhouse space so basically we have

195
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,399
only 3,000 square ft and probably the

196
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,320
really the grow space is less than that

197
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,600
the 3,000 square ft in this case is war

198
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,640
to war space um according to um uh the

199
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,639
NY and for the greenhouse and Analysis

200
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,039
these are much less um we have to grow

201
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,919
corn year round in order to provide the

202
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,240
starting material which is immature

203
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,679
embryo and then we have to grow sorbing

204
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,799
to the maturity in order to get the

205
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:30,559
seeds for the delivery so we used to

206
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,240
grow transgenic corn to to seeds for the

207
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,319
customer now we cannot afford anymore

208
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,839
and because there's no space simply and

209
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:42,320
we just have to B all our uh colleagues

210
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,240
um to take the greenhouse to to take the

211
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,800
uh transic plantlet and grow in your own

212
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,959
Greenhouse this is very difficult for

213
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:55,838
oversea business and for Germany for

214
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:57,399
Austria for Belgium we can do that we

215
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
successfully sending all these

216
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,278
transgenic plantlet across

217
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,679
uh Atlanta no problem but when we want

218
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,519
to send to Mexico even on the same

219
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,120
continent we we we Face very very

220
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,000
challenging customer issue that's really

221
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,639
just basically we cannot um overcome

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
things we cannot control

223
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:22,919
over so

224
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,000
uh and then another major issue is

225
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:30,159
recruit and retain high quality staff um

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,440
I have three staff which would has been

227
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:39,639
with me for 20 years and 10 20 years um

228
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,440
we have lot of young stuff going through

229
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,959
and then two or three years later they

230
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,760
are gone for variety of Reason um and

231
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:52,078
lot of Industry does try to uh recruit

232
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,200
our staff because we do provide very

233
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,120
good Training and at the same time and

234
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,800
because there's no such a training from

235
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,919
master degree or whatever undergraduate

236
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,919
cell biology anymore so we are seldom

237
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,559
can find anybody who is able to jump

238
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:14,240
into the transformation and then um take

239
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:17,159
Taking project and go so that's why our

240
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,720
um staff has been steady but same time

241
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,319
we become worried because we are getting

242
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,600
old we we don't get any younger we need

243
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,160
to have a Next Generation who is able to

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,440
do the same job or even better than us

245
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:33,240
uh so those are the issue we are all

246
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,600
facing every facility um public

247
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,959
institution facing that same as um

248
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:45,680
Pioneer so I think we need to build a

249
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:50,559
robot so um I I'm not joking when I'm

250
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:54,319
saying this because the camera Imaging

251
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:57,559
system and computer system can allow us

252
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,600
to identify the type of a characteristic

253
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,239
allow us to pick those type of all the

254
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,720
thing recognize and uh pick them why not

255
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,639
so the next thing if you want to think

256
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,959
about reducing transformation cost we

257
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
have to invest into working with

258
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,799
mechanical engineering computer

259
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,920
scientists

260
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:24,198
um and in cell biology and then to build

261
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,399
up a a robot that will do the job

262
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,159
otherwise you will always cry and 20

263
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,480
years ago I think this I thought this

264
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,719
would be solved by now 20 years later

265
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,159
I'm still facing this issue so okay

266
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,320
instead of a um yeah crying over we

267
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,958
probably thinking creatively uh using

268
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,480
the new technology let's build something

269
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,599
we can do um transformation fast because

270
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
sequencing think about sequencing 20

271
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,079
years or 30 years ago we had to sequence

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,159
ourself manually this revolutionized our

273
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,479
sequencing capacity I never imagined

274
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,879
this could happen but um that's a real

275
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,320
now so because of

276
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,958
limited um staff and limited

277
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,440
infrastructure and restrict our ability

278
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,319
to to research to improve transformation

279
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,759
frequency and then at beginning of our

280
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,440
establishment facility I was able to

281
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,199
actually working to improve efficiency

282
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,920
but then when we become a popular we are

283
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:28,120
so overwhelmed by all these orders we

284
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:30,919
have no time and we have no material

285
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,919
even to use research so that's that's

286
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:37,879
major issues every facility they want to

287
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,679
start their um uh service they have to

288
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,639
include the research component in into

289
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,799
that so that's how much about uh

290
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,799
transformation service part and I can

291
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,519
afford to talk about it I'm sure we are

292
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,958
going to talk about a bit more in detail

293
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,879
and but I want to uh come to the second

294
00:14:53,958 --> 00:15:00,958
aspect of my research on the uh

295
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,559
non-coding iring AG bacterial so I grow

296
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,638
up with agrobacteria that's my graduate

297
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,679
study and I was through into

298
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,560
agrobacteria world and but after my PhD

299
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,198
post I totally sick and tired of Agra

300
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,838
bacteria I don't want to have anything

301
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,679
to do with it I just want to use that to

302
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,000
transform plant so because also

303
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,000
partially I thought AG bacteria

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,879
everybody's know every bits of

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,399
agrobacteria anymore there's nothing

306
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:34,679
left for us to study so so um but back

307
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:37,559
now 6 10 years ago six uh seven years

308
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:42,198
ago I had a very weird conversation with

309
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:44,599
Stan gaving and uh we we have worked on

310
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:48,078
the NSF project and then and I have

311
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,480
conversation with Lis herela um who was

312
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,679
uh uh my my peer um colleague in

313
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,879
graduate student time about agrobacteria

314
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,919
we were asking how much do we really

315
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,759
know about agrobacteria and do we really

316
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,519
know every Gene of AR bacteria if people

317
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,159
try to know uh knock out every single

318
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,759
Gene of arabidopsis I don't know if

319
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,278
anybody has knocked out every single

320
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,879
Gene of uh agrobacteria in order to know

321
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:20,360
uh the uh the function of the Gene and

322
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:22,559
then to see if we can use this organism

323
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,959
and for any more uh transformation

324
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,000
frequency Improvement so that's why we

325
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,159
started a a a random project was let's

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,639
just sequencing the transcripton of that

327
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,919
because everybody was sequencing

328
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,480
something so

329
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:41,799
okay seriously and plus I have a good

330
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,039
friend in alumina what do you know right

331
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,679
you got to have friends in important

332
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:50,039
place and then they say well just threw

333
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:54,679
me in with this I just run it for you

334
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:57,198
and wow that's that's why okay you know

335
00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:00,159
with no support and then that's your

336
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:04,558
friend who who who were help you to

337
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:07,399
float right so see this aluminous

338
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,798
colleagues uh name on that we uh

339
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,439
designed experiment together and at that

340
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:16,400
time even alumina never have dealed with

341
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,319
uh bacteria uh transcripton so it's very

342
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,720
exciting for them to so we published a

343
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,558
one uh we just use their very new

344
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,038
technology that time and then managed to

345
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,639
identify a lot of uh uh so we had total

346
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:36,558
of

347
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,559
840 uh 8 40 8 billion million reads so

348
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:42,599
it's a very high throughput compared to

349
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:45,798
4554 that time 4554 still is a important

350
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,599
Workhorse so my friend there saying that

351
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,599
okay look we can generate a lot more

352
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:54,719
reads for you right so yeah so we got a

353
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:58,639
lot of those uh data and we uh use our

354
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,480
we work with our uh bio um informatics

355
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,080
uh

356
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:07,360
professor and colleague on campus and to

357
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:09,480
was able to uniquely map U uh to take

358
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,918
the uniquely mapped um

359
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,960
transcripton so the first thing that we

360
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:20,919
try to evaluate is that okay we check

361
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,880
our ve opon Vance Vance opon is one of a

362
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,720
group of Gene which is very important

363
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,120
for agac imediate transformation DNA

364
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,679
transformation because they they were

365
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,959
only

366
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,320
activate during the time they interact

367
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:41,079
with plant so asinger is a plant signal

368
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:44,319
molecule which induce this agrobacteria

369
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:47,599
Gene come out so when you see these red

370
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,399
Peaks those are the V Gene which induced

371
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,879
by agrobacteria by the plant signal

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,640
molecule as on sering and blue are the

373
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,520
no inducers so when you look at all

374
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,559
these um uh transcripton they say well

375
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,679
yeah hey that's really what we have

376
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:06,759
known for all these years these are very

377
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,840
highly induced and some of them are not

378
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:13,759
and then to our surprise that we find

379
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:16,558
there's a bunch of six

380
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,720
antisense which sometimes non induced

381
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,279
sometimes induced and then that you know

382
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,839
immediately was very interesting for us

383
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,119
because the CIS antisense um on The View

384
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,319
on this inducible important Gene what

385
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,678
are they

386
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,599
right

387
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:37,720
so then we characterize most of those um

388
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:42,599
identified noncoding RNA they are range

389
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:46,120
from um 0 to 521 nuclear tide and

390
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:48,399
average lens 88 88 nucleotide and a

391
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,079
medial lens 61 that's their

392
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,159
characteristic and then 88% of the small

393
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,720
RNA are on two chromosome which is not

394
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:01,679
surprising um in agerial they have a big

395
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,720
circular chromosome and linear

396
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,798
chromosome and then two plasmid and then

397
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,120
TI plasmid is the one is most important

398
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,359
to us for the plant transformation

399
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:16,639
because the tdna the the the transfer

400
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,119
DNA is on this plasmid and V is on this

401
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,679
plasmid

402
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,519
so then

403
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,759
87% of antisense RNA are on the two

404
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:32,720
plasmid and 18 are on the complemental

405
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:35,000
strand of a b d e f k so those are the

406
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,079
characteristic which we found is quite

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,480
interesting so then first thing we next

408
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:44,439
thing we were asking is that okay CIS

409
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,679
anti sense um easily you could think CIS

410
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,120
anti sense probably are regulating the

411
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,240
the the strength upset to theirs right

412
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:57,239
so do they have really Target in TRS or

413
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,679
what so then we did this analysis on

414
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,480
trans Crypton we found out they actually

415
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:07,038
do not corate so the expression of the

416
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,440
op strand opposite strand of uh the the

417
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:13,079
the gene uh the transcript transcripts

418
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,480
they are not corated with that

419
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,558
particular expression of the antient I

420
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,240
mean the uh the the small RNA so what

421
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:27,038
they are doing um so one of my student

422
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:31,440
and Abby Johnson and decide to focus on

423
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:36,158
that uh the small RNA opposite to v c

424
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,880
and uh C1 and C2 gene on the ti plasmid

425
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:43,760
so if you look at this uh V opon and you

426
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,799
will notice most of V genes on the

427
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:52,119
opposite strand on the top string and C1

428
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:55,119
and C2 are the two Gene which only these

429
00:21:52,119 --> 00:22:00,359
two on the opposite string so itself is

430
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:02,719
already weird and this C1 C2 has a very

431
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:06,719
strong expression of antisense in this

432
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,240
case so what is C what is the VC opon do

433
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,679
we know anything about this yes we

434
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,640
there's a bunch of a study have done uh

435
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,798
a while ago um

436
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,880
so I never paid attention to vsc1 and C2

437
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:24,319
because I think from literature people

438
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,278
always think that yeah it's doesn't

439
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:30,519
really abolishing the the pathogenesis

440
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:33,079
or veilance it's rather just

441
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:36,879
attenuates I don't know do you agree on

442
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:40,199
that so all this um publication just say

443
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,679
yeah it's lead to reduce so during my

444
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,000
time and if anything is not black and

445
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,798
white I was not interested in it has to

446
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,960
be black and white and that's easy right

447
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,639
you can publish science nature black and

448
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,440
white and if it's in between uh you

449
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:59,880
don't go very far so but a lot of things

450
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,880
is in between right you know so it

451
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,960
and then uh you look at the

452
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,559
VC um transcript you will see you will

453
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,720
see that transcript we see one

454
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:15,798
transcript is highly induced by ason

455
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:19,360
syon you can see the red peak come out

456
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:21,240
but vc2 seem to be not very enthusiastic

457
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,319
after induction at least in the

458
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,120
condition we have been testing over over

459
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:30,759
time vc2 is always very low Peak yeah so

460
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:33,959
then you look at the antv

461
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:36,519
C2 and then you see that region the

462
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,640
opposite strand you see the lot of

463
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:44,480
expression this ant C2 is predominantly

464
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,159
exactly opposite of C2 and then there's

465
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,798
not much of anc1 so there is this

466
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:55,360
transcripton wi of a you know coloration

467
00:23:52,798 --> 00:24:00,278
and so that's a pattern we have we are

468
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:04,359
seeing okay so the hypo this is okay vc2

469
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:07,359
anti sense is maybe regulating vsc2

470
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:10,359
sense and maybe that contribute to the

471
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:15,399
low frequency or low

472
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:17,719
expression so then we did some coration

473
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,080
analysis expression analysis so we found

474
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,200
out the vc2 and anti vsc2 is actually

475
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,599
corated very well when you have a more

476
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,600
vc2 you have a more anti

477
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,519
C2 this look at this coration it's very

478
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,519
well

479
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,440
corated and doesn't look like the

480
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,200
expression of ant vsc2

481
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,360
downregulates vc2 in this case it's like

482
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,840
the more of this and more of that it's

483
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,519
like more of a stabilizer rather than

484
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,879
you know destabilizer I don't know so

485
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,200
that's a thing we are still addressing

486
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,720
okay so then Abby did some knockout

487
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,640
because study anti sense Smalling is

488
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,960
very difficult because if you you canot

489
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,840
delete them you delete them you delete

490
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,759
the the gene opposite right so you can't

491
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,879
really delete Gene you cannot knock out

492
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:13,720
using conventional way so Abby tried to

493
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,399
look at the uh the Upstream of this anti

494
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,798
vsc2 they he she found that there's a uh

495
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,359
putative promoter region of this so she

496
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,918
then mess up a little bit of the

497
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,319
promoter region delete that part so just

498
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,640
delete a little bit of this error and

499
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,398
and see what happened so after deletion

500
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,159
and then she found her anti vc2

501
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:41,599
transcript

502
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:45,360
reduce her V C2 transcript reduce as

503
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,839
well so the coration still goes you know

504
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,479
when you reduce V C2 anti sense you

505
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:53,879
reduce

506
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:57,679
C2 so it seemed to be there is this

507
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,240
still you know um positive coration

508
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,038
instead of a

509
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,679
negative down regulates that there's

510
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:09,720
something VC anti VC to the function I

511
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:14,038
don't I still don't know what is that

512
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:17,839
right so the possible uh explanation is

513
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,960
anti sense vc2 is binded to the sense

514
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,359
transcript and stabilize and stabilize

515
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,278
it post

516
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:29,240
transcriptionally and and then could be

517
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,798
the regulation of the C2 is is uh during

518
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,440
the transcription so some of those

519
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:38,000
things are still not very clear so then

520
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,320
another things we want to do is say okay

521
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,679
after you mess around this antv C2

522
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:48,759
region do you in do you get this

523
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:51,080
verance um level down or do you have any

524
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,440
impact on Vance so that's the first

525
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:55,960
thing usually agrobacteria people always

526
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,240
do that when you mess around with a

527
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,440
strand you first want to see okay this

528
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:06,000
did you make any impact on the Vance so

529
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,000
then uh in this case we use this uh kqu

530
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,839
uh model plant or or a typical uh acid

531
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,759
system that we use for agac verance acid

532
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:21,079
so Abby inoculate two strand one is her

533
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:23,798
deletion mutation one is a wi type on

534
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,240
this kqu leaf and then you know after

535
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:28,679
two weeks and she ask it for the tumors

536
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,159
and then she sees this you know

537
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,159
um

538
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,120
reduced reduce a phenotype of her

539
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:39,519
strength and the wild type has a lot of

540
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:44,278
tumor the

541
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:48,679
the this mutant strin does not so it's

542
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:51,359
very nice but when you look at the mall

543
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,240
you see it's all over the place and this

544
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,639
the best representative if you just

545
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,480
publish that you say oh my God it's

546
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,240
great but we know better now after 30

547
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,679
years and we know these things we cannot

548
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:10,000
just say oh here yeah this is what we

549
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:13,759
expect and we do see a lot of difference

550
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,200
and so that's where uh the complication

551
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,398
is okay do we really see true

552
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,759
attenuation or it's just random plant

553
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:24,079
response to the viance right so well

554
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,359
because we don't have anything better

555
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:30,000
than just do a lot and so we start to do

556
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:34,000
a lot and the same same time we just

557
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,558
Define the uh Vance uh by Zero no

558
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
response at all then a little bit of

559
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,119
response to number one and then two and

560
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,919
three so those are the things where the

561
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:46,079
typically we just qualitatively

562
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,799
characterize so then after that then we

563
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,599
again then uh count how many of number

564
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,240
one 2 3 4 and then and then then you

565
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:57,000
measure those uh and then you you you

566
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,399
you see how many of those are actually

567
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,079
from uh

568
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:05,558
scored zero and how many score one and

569
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:08,398
how many score three so looks like here

570
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:10,720
the wi type and score zero you have less

571
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,719
of Y type you have more of a mutant

572
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,720
strength scored um zero and then you

573
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,919
have a more of wire type score number

574
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,759
three so this is still very

575
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,278
qualitative and then she did uh a

576
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:30,158
statistic analysis on this uh man

577
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:32,200
Whitney rank summer test using this for

578
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,278
that and then

579
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,278
um so she has hypothesis is a mean ranks

580
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,359
of two samples are same or the

581
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,359
alternative hypothesis is a mean rank

582
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:46,599
the two samples are different so

583
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,798
according to her analysis here is uh the

584
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,879
hypothesis alternative hypothesis is

585
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:56,798
probably true here so you know it's

586
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:59,200
again to us it's I do not really I when

587
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,158
I read this data say oh yeah you know

588
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,120
there's probably difference but you know

589
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,799
do they do this really tell us anything

590
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:10,199
so but most important things we want to

591
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:14,519
study is what really that anti C2 is

592
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,798
toing doing C uh uh has effect on C2 or

593
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,200
any other uh genes so that the

594
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:24,119
subsequent uh the experiment we are

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,720
doing right now is do this uh RNA stab

596
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,439
stabilization stability analysis and

597
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,399
then also use a more of the quantitative

598
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,480
analysis see whether they there is any

599
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,678
uh U Vance an uh differences in in these

600
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,440
two different strand or different others

601
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,480
uh and small RNA so we have other small

602
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,798
RNA also in the works a lot of them

603
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,120
actually affecting the Corum

604
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,639
sensing and the conjugation and the

605
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,678
sensitivity towards pH as well as

606
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,320
temperature and those things so as most

607
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:02,360
of a non-coding RNA n funding there are

608
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:04,960
are a fine tuning of the their respond

609
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:08,158
to the environment and I think that

610
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,880
makes sense uh some of those bacteria

611
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,960
Fitness uh affected by the um the small

612
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,880
or the small the regulating the bacteria

613
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Fitness in this case so um now to the

614
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:27,120
third aspect of my talk is about uh

615
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,840
using the nanot technology for uh the

616
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:33,319
non d DNA molecule delivery in this case

617
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,638
and this is collaboration between my lab

618
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:39,158
and with uh group in chemist Department

619
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:42,000
uh in Iowa State University and that was

620
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:45,278
led by Victor Ling that time and then he

621
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,440
unfortunately passed away five years ago

622
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,000
uh in the middle of our collaborate

623
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,558
collaboration and it was continued by

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,638
two of his students um uh bran twin

625
00:31:53,558 --> 00:32:00,038
right now is a faculty in uh Colorado

626
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:03,038
School of mind and and and continue the

627
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:06,038
uh the nanoparticle research in this

628
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:09,599
case so and that biological aspect

629
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:13,558
experiment was done by my um post Fran

630
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:16,918
Tony and then Susanna uh Martin oosa so

631
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:19,960
basically at that time and Dr Ling have

632
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:23,480
synthesized a material called mesopor

633
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,840
cycal nanoparticle which has a very

634
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,240
interesting structure uh it's a highly

635
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:32,759
regulated material and it does not F in

636
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,319
the nature and uh it's very stable and

637
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:39,158
most important is that inside there's a

638
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:44,079
very large tal pore space allow you to

639
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:46,960
um incorporate or upload payload protein

640
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:51,079
or molecules that you want to carry

641
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,840
using this uh particular uh particle so

642
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:57,119
um and then this has also very

643
00:32:53,839 --> 00:33:00,319
interesting um surface structure you can

644
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,759
really uh function surface functionalize

645
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,359
with a different molecule in order for

646
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,919
it's for the different application

647
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,119
purpose and of course all these part I'm

648
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:14,200
not able to go detail with that uh

649
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:18,119
that's all very chemical for me uh

650
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,319
so one other aspect of this uh silicon

651
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:24,158
nanop particle is that uh you can feel

652
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:28,398
that with a small molecule by simple

653
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:32,080
diffusion um then you can coal attach

654
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:35,199
the whole Poe uh in this case that uh

655
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,798
this molecule we put on the to to stop

656
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,600
this leaky from a pole are the gold

657
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:44,638
small particle which calent link to the

658
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:49,519
surface of the uh of the um uh the nanop

659
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:53,398
particle and then upon change of pH or

660
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,399
the induction of the um uh chemical in

661
00:33:53,398 --> 00:34:01,079
the uh the meteor then you can open up

662
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:04,518
the uh pour and then have the chem

663
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:06,079
molecule released from inside so that is

664
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,838
this type of feature that I was

665
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,319
interested in to use for the delivery

666
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,320
for the plant molecule that I do not

667
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,919
want to have them uh immediately

668
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,159
released that time so back 2005 we

669
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:26,239
started this uh project and then uh in

670
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:29,240
2007 we succeeded to introduce um a

671
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,519
DNA introduce produc a DNA which coated

672
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,158
outside of the nanop particle but inside

673
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:38,480
of the pole of a mesoporus nanop

674
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,398
particle we loaded with inducible

675
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:47,119
chemical molecule so when we shoot these

676
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:50,838
two substance on same um nanop particle

677
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:55,039
into plant and we will be able we

678
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:58,239
actually add reagent in the meteor and

679
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,199
had the poe open release the molecule

680
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,239
inside of a mesoporus nanop particle and

681
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,439
then get a gene

682
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:09,679
expression uh for from the DNA that we

683
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,800
introduced so it was really the first

684
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:16,159
case that we able to demonstrate that

685
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,960
there's other way of there was more than

686
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,039
one way of introduce DNA or non- DNA uh

687
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,838
molecule into plant and then make them

688
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,679
do the things that we want them to do so

689
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:32,799
uh this will give us a lot of

690
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:36,199
Versatility uh in uh lot of delivery so

691
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,000
what the MSN over the current

692
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,960
transformation system can do is that it

693
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,079
can deliver more than one biogenic

694
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,639
species at a time in our first uh um

695
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,200
paper we demonstrate that we can deliver

696
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:53,920
a gene and infector and infector that

697
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:57,239
time was a chemical uh uh chemical small

698
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,720
chemical molecule so then you have a you

699
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,919
can deliver Gene and enzyme you can

700
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,799
deliver RNA and protein you can deliver

701
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,358
multiple substance in this case and the

702
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,760
advantage of use specific molecule for

703
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:14,000
in this case is um these molecule are

704
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,280
encapsulated and you can conture release

705
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,880
that's very important sometime you don't

706
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,400
want them to release all the time at all

707
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,720
the stage and then uh uh the other thing

708
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,079
advantage of using this particular MSN

709
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,199
is a Surface can be functionalized or

710
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:34,920
targeted desire the cell or

711
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:37,399
tissue so and after this project uh um

712
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,358
published immediately really literally

713
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,440
same day we get a phone call from pimer

714
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:46,400
saying well can you deliver something

715
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,720
else than DNA I think sure why not um so

716
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,880
then they start to collaborate with us

717
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,679
um they we said well no we need to

718
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,838
deliver a protein or recombinat in this

719
00:36:53,679 --> 00:37:00,399
case crisper was not that time even

720
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:04,759
Talon wasn't even in the uh in in the

721
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,318
research area as hot as today yet so

722
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:12,920
their idea is again actually um joural

723
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:14,920
editing was not new at all back long

724
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,838
time ago that people has been always

725
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,760
trying to find the way that we can

726
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:24,318
specifically Target um a specific error

727
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,800
uh to make changes so the protein

728
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:29,880
delivery in general add in time has some

729
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,800
advantage over over uh the DNA delivery

730
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,800
it's a DNA free technology no need to

731
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,160
create

732
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,039
expression expressing line no need to

733
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,799
segregate progeny and transing activity

734
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:45,318
could reduce toxicity and of Target

735
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:49,359
mutations and some cases I think it does

736
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:52,000
save time in an analysis so the Kong the

737
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,920
disadvantage of that is you need to have

738
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,280
a protein purified in this case purify

739
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,039
DNA is lot easy to purify protein and to

740
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,160
get a lot of uh pure protein available

741
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,838
and to assess the protein activity is

742
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,000
not always easy and you can have protein

743
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,639
quantity there but you don't know if the

744
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,199
protein has enzymatic activity that you

745
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,199
want and then uh the efficiency

746
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:20,719
comparing to DNA expression is in our

747
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:23,118
case low and again the last thing the

748
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:26,799
most important is that after protein

749
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:32,318
delivery how do you select those uh

750
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:34,440
actually Ed uh so those are the issues

751
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,559
and for protein delivery but you know

752
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,679
here is illustrate what's U what we are

753
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,599
uh currently using our DNA delivery

754
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,919
system you have a plasmid which carries

755
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,720
nucleus in this case and you do the

756
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,000
regular genetic transformation and after

757
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,159
that you will have the enzyme and you

758
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,719
have this enzyme work in the plant and

759
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:00,279
then made the plant Chang into to the

760
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,480
desired place you want but that plant

761
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,200
still Carri enzyme which you don't want

762
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,358
so to get rid of those enzyme and

763
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:12,799
typically what we do we will do the self

764
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,920
cross all the uh cross-pollination self

765
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,560
pollination or cross pollination so then

766
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,838
you have a segregation for the next

767
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:24,318
generation and then you will find out

768
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:26,960
the uh the plant you use a PC and other

769
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:30,960
uh method to identify those plant which

770
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,199
has are addied genome but do not carry

771
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,800
the undesired nucleus Gene anymore so

772
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,639
that is what currently we are doing

773
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,839
we're still doing

774
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:45,279
that so it's not too bad but can be done

775
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:48,880
so the ideal situation is that if we are

776
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:53,240
able to just directly introduce the

777
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,760
nucleus using MSN or use some other uh

778
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:59,598
delivery method and into the comp plant

779
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,359
and once step you should get the addited

780
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:06,680
plant but without your nucleus because

781
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:10,799
protein will not last there so that is

782
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:14,279
ideal situation if we want to uh get

783
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:19,800
that so okay um starting

784
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:22,920
200 uh 2008 2009 we start to say okay

785
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,240
can we deliver protein uh we never tried

786
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,280
protein honestly until that time so we

787
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:34,039
purchased some egy gfp and and put them

788
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:38,119
together with um the nanop particle and

789
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:42,759
then we also try to code the

790
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:44,720
nanoparticle with a DNA expressed arop M

791
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,200
Cherry in this case so we are looking

792
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:52,239
for the cell in this case onion cell

793
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:54,960
which express both red and um the uh red

794
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,519
and then have a green color uh green is

795
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,079
simply the presence of the uh Gip

796
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,719
release from the nanoparticle red has to

797
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,640
be the DNA which carried through

798
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,679
nanoparticle but Express in this case so

799
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,078
we were able to do that immediately

800
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:14,159
after that we will say okay why don't we

801
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:17,760
just start to try this recombinat so

802
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,399
pineer provide us with a cray protein

803
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,040
actually you can buy it commercially

804
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,280
cray protein and then you load them onto

805
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,719
nanop particle in this case I want to

806
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,800
have to emphasize that part of the thing

807
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,480
I did not

808
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,760
um talk about it is optimization of

809
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,079
nanop particle bombardment nanoparticles

810
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,599
made by silica it's impossible to

811
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,599
bombard silica and that's just uh too

812
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:47,880
light to be manipulated so uh our

813
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:52,318
chemist group and managed to go plated

814
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,000
the silica with several layers of a gold

815
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,199
particle and then this is a silica

816
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,760
before gold um uh PL plating and this is

817
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:04,318
after six times of gold plating the um e

818
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,880
uh temm and sem and uh scanning

819
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:10,239
microscope shows that so no this is the

820
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,920
same thing but this temm scanning this

821
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:18,879
semm scanning so so the idea is to have

822
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:22,440
this go plated and then load it with a

823
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,960
protein cray protein and the same time

824
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Pioneer provide us with a transgenic

825
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,240
maze line that transgenic maze line

826
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,679
carry this single Gene insertion this

827
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,439
single Gene insertion looks like this a

828
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:39,598
promoter drives a g Gene which is

829
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,440
a glyphosate resistant this is

830
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,599
selectable marker and you have a

831
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:51,679
promoter Drive the uh sign uh cfp blue

832
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:55,359
protein and uh you have a piece of red

833
00:42:51,679 --> 00:43:00,279
frosen protein and then in between you

834
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:03,279
have a lock p locks P here so in theory

835
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,519
if the cray protein is working that two

836
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,680
locks P will recombine and then this

837
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:14,400
promoter will start to drive

838
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:17,199
the the DS Gene right so if a pal

839
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,200
artment if the cray protein is delivered

840
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,879
into this transgenic blue transgenic

841
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,000
cone we should see some sector of the

842
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,358
Red Cell because this is because of a

843
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,599
cray protein is working and then make

844
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:34,519
the locks P Rec combine and then delete

845
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,359
the middle part of the segment the blue

846
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:40,239
Gan blue jeans deleted and red jeans

847
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,799
hooked up with promoter and

848
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:46,439
express so this is what we actually

849
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,480
found that we were able to see trans the

850
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:55,240
red and then stable red core callous and

851
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,880
then you have this segregating um uh red

852
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,078
callus uh the con

853
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,440
look the half of them are the blue and

854
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,440
half of them

855
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,679
red cism and then you have also this uh

856
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,960
tassel this is the original transic core

857
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,838
you can see it's blue it shines in the

858
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,199
blue Channel but not in the red Channel

859
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:24,078
this is the after we combined the blue

860
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:24,078
color is gone and the Red Express there

861
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,039
so to do with the remote

862
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:38,480
oh

863
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,480
exciting recat working

864
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:51,639
that's so Grand Finale

865
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:54,759
that then we take all this recom uh

866
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:58,719
recombination uh combine lines and then

867
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,280
make the sequencing and then they have

868
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:05,000
they really had a beautiful precise exis

869
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:11,720
every single line of them sorry about

870
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:16,039
that um so um so these the original uh

871
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:20,399
the the the sequence and uh after

872
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:23,960
the lock p recom uh recombined fuse

873
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,318
together and then these are the um

874
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,358
protein bombarded line these are the

875
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:33,920
plasmic bombarded line because we also

876
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,519
introduce DNA as our control where DNA

877
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,920
introduced the line and then protein

878
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:42,119
troduced line they result the same and

879
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,680
so that was quite fun things to do and

880
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,680
then we show that we can deliver protein

881
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:50,159
and recombinat and then make it working

882
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,480
in the plant and exactly the place is

883
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:56,078
supposed to work so that was uh one

884
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,639
illustration all the demonstration of

885
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:04,119
the protein ch be delivered uh for

886
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:08,318
future nucleus aided genome editing um

887
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:12,358
so very final five five minutes about

888
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:15,039
okay Ms delivery and it's great and it

889
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:19,000
but it this disadvantage so what's the

890
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:22,519
problem here you have Advantage is that

891
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,880
control Rel and the major advantage that

892
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:27,440
we use this particular type of Nano

893
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,280
particle is a poor size

894
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,679
limitation so after we deliver qu

895
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,200
protein everybody is happy and same time

896
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:37,239
everybody start to say oh it's too small

897
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,799
the size because the pole size is only

898
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:44,239
10 nanometer that's the height so we can

899
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,720
push with the current formula and so if

900
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,959
we are going to uh deliver Talon or the

901
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:55,199
crisper all of them are much higher than

902
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:58,400
the pole allow us to upload and also

903
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,358
this encapsulate the protein release

904
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,519
maybe too slow for us what we want so at

905
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,239
the same time say will say okay well you

906
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:09,400
know nanop is great and can we think

907
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,199
about something else um well here is

908
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,920
something else as we we coined it we

909
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,318
call it called

910
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,838
prolistic so it's a

911
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:23,719
bombarded method for intell delivery of

912
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:27,119
protein only so um in this case we just

913
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:31,480
simply modify our current DNA delivery

914
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:34,119
system by lopiz the protein or air dry

915
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:38,719
the protein onto the carrier and then

916
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:41,720
bomat so um depends on protein we use

917
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,759
and we are able to introduce variety of

918
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:47,439
the protein in this case we have a GP

919
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,480
introduced and we have to we also use a

920
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,960
try labeled BSA which is a rather large

921
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,760
uh um protein the reason we use those

922
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,440
things is because they are cheap they

923
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,640
are color colorful and then cheap and

924
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,559
then BSA or GP is way too expensive and

925
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:09,358
then we also bombard the Gus enzyme um

926
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,760
that allow us to uh also be able to show

927
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:14,440
that actually can turn the blue when you

928
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,400
put the substrate there and then we also

929
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,480
uh bombard some of enzyme uh such as the

930
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,318
trene and rnes because once you bombard

931
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,440
those uh destructive uh uh enzyme you

932
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:28,480
should see the cell death in this case

933
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,280
so looks like we can bombard variety of

934
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,599
DNA just by the protein just by through

935
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,400
them in and that's one of the thing uh

936
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:43,200
we have been doing uh using the protein

937
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,358
delivery and um we also bombard the um

938
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,919
animal uh tissue in this case try to

939
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:52,159
broaden our patent claim right just

940
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:56,159
demonstrate that we can do it more than

941
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:59,279
um plant cell uh these protol listic can

942
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,039
be used to co- delivery DNA and protein

943
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,798
same

944
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:07,960
time um it's a very simple procedure and

945
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:10,719
you use a current existing Gene gun and

946
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,039
quite reproducible in our hand very

947
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,480
simple um no restriction on the protein

948
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:20,798
type and can deliver protein and enzyme

949
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,079
uh with a different molecular weight and

950
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:27,159
ISO uh electri Point all the tertial

951
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,240
structure the major part this advantage

952
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:32,879
to us is probably you cannot control

953
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:37,439
release you bombard that's it

954
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:41,240
so um with that I will thank um my

955
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,559
colleagues in the um PL transformation

956
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:47,919
facility and we also have a group people

957
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,119
who work on small artive noncoding RNA

958
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,838
then the nanoparticle work was a

959
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,880
collaboration with uh chemistry

960
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:57,798
Department as well as Pioneer and our

961
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,720
current founding for this particular

962
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:03,759
project that come from internal andn

963
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,619
Pioneer collaboration project thank you

964
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:12,480
very

965
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:15,440
[Applause]

966
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,679
much so that gen is very close and

967
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,679
converion with your G so possibly the

968
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:23,759
your G transer Serv reading through well

969
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,440
we thought about that we actually looked

970
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,960
into that it's not it's not the re

971
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:34,440
through actually there's a quite U uh

972
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,639
significant and quite uh clear stop

973
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,280
after V yeah we thought about that it's

974
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:43,400
a

975
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:46,559
true yeah we didn't test this little uh

976
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,480
cutive promoter area it's very very nice

977
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,640
promoter area but we don't know if it's

978
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,199
a to restart we haven't test this area

979
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,519
to promote enough it's a potential

980
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,000
promoting area that we have

981
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:04,159
so the other

982
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,159
Plasma's a massive

983
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,760
El oh yeah yeah exactly so right now we

984
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,400
try to

985
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,240
decouple so we have a promoter Drive the

986
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,480
top path and then we have a promoter

987
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:22,118
Drive bottom

988
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,480
path and hopefully that will help us

989
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,000
understand because we cannot believe

990
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:30,119
that we we have to overexpress and so we

991
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,079
decouple them by Drive top strand bottom

992
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:35,760
strands whether there is any coration

993
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,039
right so that's have you achieved

994
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,720
nuclear localization of one of these uh

995
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:45,000
PR realistically delivered proteins we

996
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:47,000
never tried to test with a nuclear local

997
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,960
we didn't put a nuclear localization

998
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,960
signal oh you are talking about uh the

999
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,599
protein yeah yeah I mean it looks to me

1000
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,119
like they they get in and they diffuse

1001
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,480
throughout the cell so I think they go

1002
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,519
into the nucleus just fine

1003
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,920
but that's good question we never would

1004
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,798
actually look into where they are focus

1005
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,720
into or get into the nucleus

1006
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:08,679
localization

1007
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:10,879
not so you expect the protein go into

1008
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,480
nucleus I'm just wondering you're trying

1009
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,960
to deliver cast n it's got to get to the

1010
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,639
nucleus right and and whether that would

1011
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,720
go in by chance just by being bombarded

1012
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:23,159
all the way through the nuclear membrane

1013
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:27,399
or you probably could just uh um have a

1014
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:29,920
CL n have a nuclear localization signal

1015
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,400
s soci together with that right so if

1016
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,920
they have that for sure they will go

1017
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,559
they will go in put the V of whatever

1018
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,000
that V protein that we have a nucle

1019
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,440
organization the V2

1020
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,239
promoter will guide

1021
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,599
you higher

1022
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,598
efficiency thank you very

1023
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,480
much this has been in a production of

1024
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,480
