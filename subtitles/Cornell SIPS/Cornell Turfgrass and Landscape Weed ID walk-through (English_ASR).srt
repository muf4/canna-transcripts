00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,470
University

3
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:10,079
okay hello there my name is Carl mentee

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,099
with the Cornell turfgrass program and

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,650
today I'm gonna walk everyone through

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,440
how to use our turf and landscape weed

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,170
ID tool and this is an online resource

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,150
that dr. Jenny Cao - here at Cornell our

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,760
weed scientists developed she's got a

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,879
lot of great help over the years from

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,950
people like grant Thompson Reagan ette

12
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,679
Leah Butler Jones has most recently but

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,000
a lot of work into this website so today

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,909
what I want to do is just walk everybody

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,619
through how to use the website and we're

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,269
gonna do that with a weed I went out and

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,369
found this morning so it's early April

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,780
I'm out in the backyard and found this

19
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,329
weed I'm gonna throw it up here in the

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,469
top right hand corner of the screen and

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,689
we're just gonna go ahead and use the

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,450
website and try and figure out what this

23
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,699
weed is so to start you know I just

24
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,460
typed in Cornell weed ID on Google and

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,219
first thing that pops up is our website

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,320
so I'm gonna go ahead and click on that

27
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,170
and we got our first decision here right

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,109
so is it a grass leg or broadleaf weed

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,000
like so you know pretty obviously as you

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,409
can see up here this looks like a

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,200
broadleaf weed I'm just gonna go ahead

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,650
and click that so now this brings me to

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,439
kind of the main screen here I can see

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,820
I've got a hundred and eighteen results

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,219
and here's you know you can see each

36
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,399
weed the name and just a general picture

37
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,500
there so you know if I wanted to I could

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,840
go and click on each one of these and

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,579
see if it looks like my weed but really

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,530
what I'm gonna use is this stuff on the

41
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,149
left-hand side of the screen here all

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,780
these traits that are gonna help me

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,219
whittle down what what weed it is so

44
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,780
when I'm looking at this weed and you

45
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,938
may or may not be able to see it up here

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,790
in the top right but I see a lot of

47
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,819
hairiness and fuzziness and the leaf so

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,860
I'm gonna see if any one of these

49
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:54,688
characteristics over here on the Left

50
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,629
describes that so scroll down and and

51
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,339
here's where I where I'm looking tactile

52
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,339
so I see smooth fuzzy and rough and

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,840
that's that fuzzy texture is definitely

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,960
what I'm what I'm seeing on my weed so

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,519
I'm gonna click on that and now we've

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,639
we've narrowed things down so we got

57
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:14,039
from 118 to walk to only 16

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,889
um so again I could go ahead and scroll

59
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,929
through all these and see what they if

60
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:22,469
they match my weed but I'm gonna go one

61
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,760
more step and the stature thing looks

62
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,069
like a trade I can narrow things down

63
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,639
with and you know based on what I saw

64
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,930
outside spreading is the trade it's got

65
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,559
click on that and now we're down to

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,210
three so I can look at these and and I

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,789
think one of these looks tough

68
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,800
definitely like my weed but let me check

69
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:42,840
some other ones first common mallow so

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,430
it's got some of the traits I selected

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,210
but definitely doesn't look like my weed

72
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,640
right the leaf shape isn't quite right

73
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,159
yellow hawk weed okay you know I'm not

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,619
seeing that in my weed definitely

75
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,049
definitely not like my we'd finally

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,930
Mouse here chick weed okay

77
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,680
so as I think everybody can see this is

78
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,240
uh it's got the hairiness on there

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,520
definitely resembles what I've got

80
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,480
and so each weed on the website has

81
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,280
multiple pictures so dr. Kenneth Ann and

82
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,829
her team have done a really good job of

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,569
putting in multiple pictures here you

84
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,880
can see the seed size if you want to get

85
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,000
really specific what it looks like it's

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,709
a seedling so you know there is pretty

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,370
quick way to do identify Mouse your

88
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,219
chick weed and I can go down here some

89
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,159
information on no lifecycle and traits

90
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,359
and some identifying characteristics and

91
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,569
then of course I can also look at

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,560
controls right so I click on that tab I

93
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,560
scroll down here and I've got control

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,140
options so conventional pesticides I

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,759
think these are New York specific so if

96
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,949
we don't have a certain website label in

97
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,659
New York it's not gonna be on here but

98
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,458
you've got those and then you've got

99
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,789
reduced risk and minimum risk options -

100
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,000
so for K through 12 managers K through

101
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,500
12 Grounds managers here in New York

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,409
they have restrictions on conventional

103
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,439
pesticide use so for most cases they're

104
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:11,189
limited to these reduced or minimum risk

105
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,799
options so you know that's a that's a

106
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,689
great way to use this tool it gets you

107
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,829
to a screen you can identify your weed

108
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:21,000
and you can learn a little bit more

109
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,609
about things one more thing I like and

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,319
it's a new feature on this website is

111
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,090
the pesticide free management

112
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,639
so this is something alia Butler Jones

113
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,709
has worked a lot on recently again

114
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,569
geared towards our K through 12 managers

115
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,870
where they've got kind of these unique

116
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,300
situations fence lines gravels mulch

117
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,110
areas right so we can go in here and we

118
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,170
can learn about non pesticide ways to to

119
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,590
control weeds in these areas so it gives

120
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,449
you options for mechanical control

121
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:54,060
barriers how you're gonna set up that

122
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,560
fence line in a way that's gonna allow

123
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,509
you to manage those weeds better and

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,490
more efficiently thermal weeding

125
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,810
something we've studied here at our turf

126
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,250
grass program thermal weeding right so

127
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:13,920
let's burn those plants up here's some

128
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:16,110
options things to think about so you

129
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,900
know a great addition to this website I

130
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,300
think has been this pesticide free

131
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,299
management area again these are kind of

132
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,759
problem areas where you know you're

133
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,389
gonna think about non non pesticide

134
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,279
products and their control options so

135
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:34,769
that's a quick overview of the turf and

136
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,599
landscape weed ID website I hope

137
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:39,209
everyone found that useful and and

138
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,010
hopefully you can keep this place

139
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:42,659
bookmarked in your browser now I did it

140
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,959
on the computer you can of course do it

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,580
on your phone too so I always available

142
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,439
if you're out in the field and looking

143
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,849
to do something out there so I hope

144
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,029
everyone has found this helpful and

145
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,030
thanks for watching this has been a

146
00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:01,279
production of Cornell University on the

147
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,279
web at cornell edu
