1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,160
University thanks um uh first time I

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,719
think I presented here so uh thanks for

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,079
giving me the chance I'm going to tell

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,439
you a little bit about some of the stuff

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,879
we work on we work on a lot of different

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,039
projects uh so I've sort of talked uh

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,480
I've chosen something that relates

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,519
pretty specifically I think to plant

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,079
micro interactions but just to give you

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,519
the overview we're very interested in

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,239
what microbes are doing in soil and

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,200
because microbial communities in soil

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,799
are tremendously diverse and most of

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,960
those organisms are still

16
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,479
uncharacterized you know our focus is

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,359
first and foremost on that diversity and

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,640
understanding what drives it so that's

19
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,439
questions of

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,558
biogeography uh where we're thinking

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,119
about how microbes get to where they are

22
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,839
and why they're successful in those

23
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,479
environments so those can be large scale

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,039
biogeography uh and what drives that but

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,198
also in terms of Agriculture that's

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,320
management so things we do very much

27
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,478
influence the success of dispersal the

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,879
fitness of the organisms we want to know

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,000
why that is what makes them successful

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,599
or not um we're also interested in

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
evolution because microbes can evolve

32
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,879
kind of quickly and how they change will

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,319
affect both whether they're successful

34
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,000
in that environment as well as what they

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,559
do in that environment so specifically

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,319
we're interested in how their genomes

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,640
change and how that change relates to

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,039
the diversity and so our big question

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,759
here relates a lot to Al Gene transfer

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
so how are they exchanging information

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,280
who are they exchanging information with

42
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,959
how is that dependent on dispersal or

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,239
Community composition and what does that

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,839
do to their function in terms of their

45
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,879
functions we want to know how their

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,118
diversity affects what they do um we're

47
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,280
very interested in the carbon and

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,359
nitrogen cycle and both of these things

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,159
relate to soil Health uh and so we're

50
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,759
interested in that as well so in terms

51
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,200
of carbon we're interested in how

52
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,319
microbes transform carbon in the soil

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,079
and how they contribute to soil organic

54
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,639
matter formation so most of our Sol

55
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,399
organic matter is made up of dead

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,560
microbes and so the growth and death of

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,639
microbes is super important to that um

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,560
and also microbes contribute a lot to

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,598
that nitrogen cycle as well in terms of

60
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,759
making nitrogen available transforming

61
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,518
that nitrogen um and ultimately that

62
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:24,919
brings us back to plants because plants

63
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,719
are the Big Driver of these systems so

64
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,919
whether it's biogeography or management

65
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,680
or their evolution or their function

66
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,878
plants are constantly pushing on the

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,200
microbes and the microbes are of course

68
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:37,878
pushing back uh and so the more we get

69
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,158
interested in for example the carbon

70
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,959
cycle the more we realize that what

71
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:43,479
microbes do in terms of the carbon cycle

72
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,680
is driven by the plants and so that's

73
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,039
what I'll tell you a little bit about

74
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,560
today specifically some work we've been

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,679
doing to get more involved with

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,360
plants and so the phenomena I'm going to

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
be talking about today something we're

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,959
just starting to really look at in my

79
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,280
lab is called priming and so the idea of

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,360
priming goes back a long way it's the

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,479
idea that microbes are interacting with

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,120
soil organic matter so the carbon that's

83
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,079
stored in the soil which is basically

84
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,200
the basis of soil fertility right plants

85
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,599
do not have the enzymes that they need

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,959
to get access to this just like you

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,479
can't eat you can't digest plant

88
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,439
material without your microbes

89
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,959
enzymatically a UK carot just doesn't

90
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,199
have the diversity of enzymes that

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,920
microbes have and so I have microbes in

92
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,878
my gut that help me eat plant material

93
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,479
these plants interacting with microbes

94
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,719
in the soil to get access to the

95
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,798
nutrients in the soil right so what

96
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,359
priming is is if I add a little bit of

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,879
carbon to the soil microbes I change

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,599
their activity and that could be a

99
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,438
negative priming result in which case I

100
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,119
add some carbon to the soil that

101
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:52,158
activates these microbes and they cause

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
more so to be mineralized than I would

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,479
have expected based on the amount of

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
carbon I add so basically I'm priming

105
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,598
the pump just like if you're priming a

106
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,359
water pump on the other side you can

107
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,078
actually get positive priming so

108
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,920
sometimes when you add carbon to soil

109
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,280
you cause some of that carbon to be

110
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,119
stored permanently or semi permanently

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,280
as s so so presumably that's because the

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,640
microbes grow and when they die their

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,439
little dead bodies are contributing to

114
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,000
the accumulation of carbon and stable

115
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,959
pools so depending on how we add the

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,839
carbon and the environmental conditions

117
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,000
we can get one or the other response and

118
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,478
the literature is a mess you know it's

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,519
it's hard to know exactly when you're

120
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,359
going to get one or the other people do

121
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,240
the same thing in different experiments

122
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,360
and come up with different results and

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
so there's not a good strong mechanism

124
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,879
as to what's driving this and of course

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,400
this is just adding carbon but in the

126
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,600
real world this would be driven by

127
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,319
plants through either riseo deposition

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,120
or exitation plants have the ability to

129
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,079
release some of their photosynthetic

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,519
carbon through the root system and

131
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,519
presumably hypothetically they could be

132
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,198
driving negative or positive priming and

133
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,560
the reason for this primarily might be

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,600
that by getting a an advantage by

135
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,360
activating negative priming the microbes

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,439
go after the Soom that's mineralizing

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,360
carbon CO2 but then that also releases

138
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,600
things like n and p that are locked up

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,800
in that so the plant would have an

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,759
ability to push on the gas pedal try and

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,879
get more nutrients by activating

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
microbes

143
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,199
hypothetic that's the kind of phenomena

144
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,560
we're interested in so I got interested

145
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,639
in this with because we're in a great

146
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,399
School of plant Sciences so I had

147
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,720
collaboration with Taran barley in

148
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,879
horiculture who was working with uh a

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
priming experiment she was doing out at

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,120
arnno fars with maple trees and at the

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,279
same time just by coincidence I was

152
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,079
doing some work collaborating with or at

153
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,279
least I had taken over for a project

154
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,120
Jean Madson had started in microbiology

155
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,159
and Jean as many of you know passed a

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,918
few years ago because I did a lot of

157
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,960
similar research to him I took over some

158
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,120
of his projects when he when he died and

159
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,758
took them to completion and it just so

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
happened that these two things

161
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,879
intersected in a very interesting way so

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,800
the experiment Taran was doing was

163
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,759
taking soil from the maple trees and

164
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,720
then a typical priming experiment you

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,479
add different carbon sources to that

166
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,479
soil now this is without the roots

167
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,918
present and if you add glucose you don't

168
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,360
really see significant priming she was

169
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,918
adding aromatics because she knew that

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,319
these roots were producing aromatic uh

171
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,959
uh phenolic acids and aromatic acids in

172
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,879
their exid dates and she wanted to know

173
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,279
sort of what was happening why were they

174
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,959
doing this and was this relating to

175
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,918
priming so she added benzoic acid as

176
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,638
well as combinations of different things

177
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,198
and she did the experiment with other

178
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,598
kind of aromatics as well I'm just

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,000
showing the result for benzoic acid but

180
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,000
benzoic acid induced significant priming

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,079
and then you had this sort of

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
synergistic effect when you had glucose

183
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,079
and benzoic acid together which was sort

184
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,680
of interesting and so the question is

185
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,198
sort of what's going on why is this

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,560
happening so she was able to show that

187
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,080
the priming is in no small part not

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,759
surprisingly driven by changes in enzyme

189
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:12,878
activity so beta galactosidase activity

190
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,439
um the phosphatase activity netal glucos

191
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,439
glucosidase activity all of these were

192
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,240
accelerated by the presence of this

193
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,199
benzoic acid so that's what we would

194
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,960
expect with this negative priming we

195
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,160
also see that the priming was driven by

196
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,478
a change in community composition so

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,840
here this is an ordination where each of

198
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,959
these spots is a different Community

199
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,399
composition when the spots are close

200
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,038
together that means the communities are

201
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,198
similar so here's where we started we

202
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,038
add different substrates and then over

203
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,400
time we see those substrates cause a

204
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,839
shift in the community but we see that

205
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,519
the benzoic acid and benzoic acid plus

206
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,598
glucose really caused this different

207
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,680
effect from everything else and that

208
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,319
different effect was associated with

209
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,240
higher amounts of priming as it turned

210
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,240
out she uh worked with us to have some

211
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,158
help analyzing the Cal communities in

212
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,439
these data and a lot of this difference

213
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:08,319
in the community that was driven by that

214
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,199
benzoic acid was affiliated with this

215
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,240
one group of organisms Brooker ACA so

216
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,079
they went through the roof and this was

217
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,759
super exciting to us because at the same

218
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,560
time we were working with this data from

219
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,879
Jean Madson and we saw some of the same

220
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,759
organisms coming up so when am I at

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,240
seven minutes s minutes

222
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,080
and8 um

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,278
so

224
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,399
uh so so he was doing stabil isotope

225
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,918
probing experiments he happened to be

226
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,278
using 13c parah hydroxy benzoid so we

227
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:45,199
could track that into the microbes what

228
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:48,639
we saw from him was that these parabal

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
area uh which are members of barpal der

230
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,720
dominated this activity they were

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,839
exactly the same microbes that Taran saw

232
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,240
we isolated some of these guys and the

233
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,959
thing that's very interesting about them

234
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,879
is they're loaded with ring cleavage

235
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,838
enzymes so they're really good at taking

236
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,000
apart soil organic matter they're loaded

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
with phosphatase activity so they're

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,360
really good at

239
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
solubilizing uh inorganic phosphorus

240
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,000
they also tend to associate with the

241
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,320
roots of a lot of plants so if you've

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,639
heard of beta risia these uh nodulating

243
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,640
bacteria that are not in the alpha

244
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,639
proteo bacteria they're parabal area so

245
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,519
these guys have these tight associations

246
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,278
with plants and we think that plants are

247
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,879
facilitated their growth I'm going to

248
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,439
jump ahead the model we have is these

249
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,799
microbes really like sugars so if you

250
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
give them sugars they grow like crazy

251
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,399
they really like the phenolic acids and

252
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,159
they're able to eat a lot of them if you

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,919
give them the phenolic acids they grow

254
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,639
like crazy but if you give them the

255
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,039
sugars they don't induce their ring

256
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,639
cleavage activity so if you give them

257
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,199
sugars they'll grow a lot but then if

258
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,838
you hit them with the phenolic acids

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
they'll turn on the ring cleavage and go

260
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,320
after this organic matter so we think we

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,079
have a mechanism whereas the plant could

262
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,680
control what the microb is doing because

263
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,759
not everything can eat these phenolic

264
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,039
acids so if you have the phenolic acids

265
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,519
these guys will be able to grow maybe

266
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,559
not anything that can grow using sugar

267
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,278
so the plant can control who's there and

268
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,159
who's actually going after this organic

269
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,320
matter and maybe the plant's able to

270
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,919
regulate this priming

271
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,519
activity participant uh any questions in

272
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,278
the

273
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:30,039
room part the community is you're

274
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:34,078
tracking uh bacteria or

275
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:37,559
so the par the parab area are oh the

276
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:41,000
question was are they bacteria or fungi

277
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:44,239
so the pararal areia are bacteria yeah

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,039
uh an interesting aspect of this is that

279
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,839
related organisms to these parabal areia

280
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,679
are often highly enriched in the

281
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,519
hyphosphere so there's the potential for

282
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:58,199
three-way associations like plant AMF

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,679
bacteria associated with the AMF because

284
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,519
when people look they're often

285
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:07,679
co-occurring with some of these fungal

286
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:12,159
networks my question related more to the

287
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:17,399
analysis microbial diversity and how it

288
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:19,240
shifted was it bacteria populations only

289
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,360
in this particular experiment we were

290
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,560
only tracking the

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,039
bacteria these am the the the the maple

292
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,559
trees that were the subject of this

293
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,719
often host AMF

294
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,159
so we think that AMF probably are part

295
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,160
of that

296
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
equation okay well thank you Josh for

297
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,239
spear hitting this and thank you Gillian

298
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,360
for the invitation to be here it's

299
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,639
really a pleasure as Josh said this is

300
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,000
my second month on the job but I'm

301
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,799
really happy to share with you some of

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
my thoughts about my program and some of

303
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,759
the research directions that we'll be

304
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,079
taking so I am a vegetable breeder and

305
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,360
the program that I'm starting here

306
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,399
Cornell's focused on tomato and eggplant

307
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,480
breeding with the emphasis on the

308
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,519
Northeastern United States and New York

309
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,920
especially uh to give a really high

310
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,679
level overview of the objectives of our

311
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,240
program you know really broadly they are

312
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,958
to discover the genetic basis of traits

313
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,120
that are of agronomic or consumer

314
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,399
importance in our region to model

315
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,799
strategies for the implementation of new

316
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,958
predictive breeding Technologies like

317
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,919
genomic selection that have been really

318
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,719
widely adopted in agronomic crops

319
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,319
species but are kind of lagging behind

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,560
in in vegetables for several reasons and

321
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,839
finally to release cultivars with with

322
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:42,159
high yield excellent quality and

323
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,880
resistance to the prevalent diseases in

324
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
our

325
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,838
region so as a faculty member with an

326
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,440
extension appointment um I have been

327
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,120
enjoying spending kind of my first

328
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
several weeks on the job getting to know

329
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,198
my colleagues in Cornell Cooperative

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
Extension and and just learning a little

331
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:02,198
bit more about the nature of tomato and

332
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,799
egg plant growing in New York state and

333
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,559
uh I've found it both amazing but also

334
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,278
as a breeder kind of daunting just how

335
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,799
much variety there is in terms of how

336
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,600
these crops are grown how they're

337
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,639
marketed and uh what what Market classes

338
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,440
and crop types are grown so the last

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,519
time the USDA released statistics for

340
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,199
New York State there were close to 3,000

341
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,799
Acres of tomato production in New York

342
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,359
that includes everything from the open

343
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,439
field to high tunnels which are very

344
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,000
important in our state uh both for

345
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,639
season extension and for crop protection

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,198
and also uh in greenh houses I believe

347
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,560
there are over 200 Acres of tomatoes uh

348
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,519
underglass uh in these you know really

349
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,838
high-tech uh facilities that are

350
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,919
operated by some of the world's um

351
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,560
largest and most sophisticated uh

352
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,599
Greenhouse tomato production companies

353
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,319
in in our

354
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,920
state uh tomatoes are sold to Wholesale

355
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Distributors they're sold at produce

356
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,120
auctions they're sold at csas and

357
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,480
farmers markets they're grown in gardens

358
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,600
and in urban farms and urban Gardens um

359
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,680
everything has grown from cherry

360
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,159
tomatoes to heirm tomatoes to the modern

361
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,439
red

362
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,240
slicers um and in terms of eggplant uh I

363
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,040
found it amazing how much variation

364
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
there is in crop type there including

365
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,000
types that you know many people here are

366
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,959
largely unfamiliar with uh including the

367
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,720
African eggplant which is uh not even

368
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,039
the same species as the Italian plant

369
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,040
that we're familiar with but it's a

370
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,879
really important part of the diet uh in

371
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,360
many regions of the world and I think

372
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,799
their opportunities for new markets for

373
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,800
for New York

374
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,559
Growers so you know ac across the board

375
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,319
uh across all these different production

376
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,638
systems and Market classes uh there's a

377
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,440
really strong demand from uh Growers for

378
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,320
disease resistance in varieties and just

379
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,440
as an illustrated example I took this

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,360
screenshot from Bayer's uh web page this

381
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,759
is one of their uh tomato varieties and

382
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
if you look at the disease resistance

383
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,800
codes which you might be familiar with

384
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,079
if you look at seat cataly LS uh there's

385
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,078
somewhere between eight and 10 different

386
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,239
uh disease resistances that are stacked

387
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,799
in this one variety and again you know

388
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
uh this is something that is both

389
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,559
amazing to me but also really daunting

390
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,198
as a breeder just how many different

391
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,359
disease resistances you need in a

392
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,958
variety in order to be commercially

393
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,199
competitive

394
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,719
nowaday so the the reason that breeders

395
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,879
have been able to to do this amazing

396
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,399
work is really due to a very rich Legacy

397
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:35,720
of uh collection and characterization

398
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:39,039
and curation of uh wild tomato species

399
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,560
uh almost all of the disease resistances

400
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,919
that are available in modern tomato

401
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,559
varieties come from a wild relative of

402
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,599
tomato uh in in many crops you know we

403
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,239
often hear people talk about concern

404
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,319
about erosion of genetic diversity as a

405
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,839
result of of modern breeding compared to

406
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,000
some of the land races and traditional

407
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,199
varieties that were grown years ago it's

408
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,639
incredible that in tomato is actually

409
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,519
the opposite if you look at the

410
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,919
varieties that are available nowadays

411
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,318
there's more genetic variation in that

412
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,719
domesticated tomato gene pool because of

413
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,439
all the variation that breeders have

414
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,959
brought in from Wild relatives

415
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,199
predominantly driven by breeding for

416
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,919
disease

417
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,159
resistance so when when I think about uh

418
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,759
how I want to contribute to this Legacy

419
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,719
of breeding for disease resistance and

420
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,560
solcius crops one thing that I keep in

421
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
mind and and I think this is an audience

422
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,239
that won't argue with me too much on

423
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,639
this is how important it is to have some

424
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,639
understanding the Dynamics of the

425
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,039
pathogen populations as well I think

426
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,120
there are many examples uh of this in

427
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,439
tomato one of them that's particularly

428
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,440
relevant to our state due to the high

429
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,279
tunel production it's importance here is

430
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,839
tomato leaf mold that's a disease that

431
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,838
is really a limiting factor for high

432
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,160
tunnel tomato production although it's

433
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,920
not really a concern in the open field a

434
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,559
project that I was involved in with a

435
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,240
former labmate of mine Martha Sudan who

436
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,239
who led this work uh we we characterize

437
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,440
the genetic diversity of of strains of

438
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,400
tomato leaf mold from our region uh one

439
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,679
of the important takeaways that we found

440
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,720
uh from some race typing experiments was

441
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,240
that all the strains that we collected

442
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,798
were of two races race zero and two uh

443
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,759
for me as a breeder it's important to

444
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,879
know this because there's one gene

445
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,959
that's really used predominantly in

446
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,199
tomato breeding for resistance to tomato

447
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,120
leaf mold that's cf9 which thankfully

448
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,558
confers resistance against both of these

449
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,759
races that we see in our region but else

450
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,839
in the world there reports of that

451
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,240
resistance breaking down so my takeaway

452
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,959
moving forward as a plant breeder is

453
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,798
that even if our populations in our

454
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,480
region at the moment don't necessarily

455
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,879
warrant it I think the proactive

456
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,519
approach is to start stacking some of

457
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,640
these other resistance genes into our

458
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:47,839
varieties with the expectation that

459
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,799
given the usage of high tunnels and the

460
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,720
exclusive use of this one resistance

461
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,798
Gene we we may expect to see that

462
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,798
resistance breaking down in the

463
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,918
future um tomato leaf mold is a good

464
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,759
example because it's a a pathogen that's

465
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,480
been very well characterized at the

466
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,599
molecular level in terms of uh its H

467
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,759
pathogen interactions there are many

468
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,319
more examples of pathos systems where we

469
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,798
really know next to nothing about the

470
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,720
nature of the variation in the pathogen

471
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,480
that that uh influences the ability of

472
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,240
certain strains or populations to cause

473
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,798
disease and varieties and others not to

474
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
uh so in earlier work that I did in my

475
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,879
PhD I was interested in kind of

476
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,360
answering this question a little bit in

477
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,559
phytop capsy which causes phyto light on

478
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,000
pepper one of the things that we did was

479
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,480
take a collection of isolates challenge

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,159
it on different pepper varieties and

481
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,839
conduct a genome light Association study

482
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,799
to try to find those genes that are

483
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,240
involved in verin on different varieties

484
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,158
what we ended up finding was that the

485
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,720
lowside that we had the power to be able

486
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,600
to map um tended to have an effect on

487
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,640
veillance on all the peppers that we

488
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,599
tested which seems to suggest that in

489
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,320
this pathos system perhaps the strongest

490
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,359
effect interactions are race nonspecific

491
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:03,639
or variety nonspecific and there are

492
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,759
smaller effect interactions that have

493
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,759
more of a race um specific

494
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:14,839
nature so in terms of uh future

495
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,720
directions for my research program um as

496
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,918
I've been talking to extension

497
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,159
Specialists and colleagues in pathology

498
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,280
and Growers uh as soon as I mentioned

499
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,000
eggplant everyone tells me vertican welt

500
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,158
resistance which seems like a pretty

501
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,279
good indication that that's something

502
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,159
that should work on um so I'm planning

503
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,960
on studying the the inheritance of

504
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,200
resistance to verticy Will and eggplant

505
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120
wild relatives I'm interested in how

506
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
that performs against the two species of

507
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,558
verum we have both of which are

508
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,279
controlled by a single Gene in tomato uh

509
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,000
my my predecessor in tomato breeding at

510
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:50,519
Cornell Martha mudler did fantastic work

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,558
on folar uh fungal disease resistance um

512
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,158
but it's predominantly available in a

513
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,558
small number of genetic Backes um so I'm

514
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,960
interested in understanding how we can

515
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,119
use markers related to those genes to

516
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,880
predict that resistance in a diversity

517
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,038
of other uh Market classes of tomato and

518
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,080
then lastly you know as I kind of

519
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,000
alluded to the the the Paradigm for its

520
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,119
matal breeding has been uh backcrossing

521
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,519
and introgression of qualitative major

522
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,119
effect resistance genes the pathogens

523
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,200
that breeders have been slower and less

524
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,199
able to make a big impact on are those

525
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,159
diseases that are controlled more by

526
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,440
quantitative resistance Loi I'm

527
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,159
interested in working on some strategies

528
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,519
uh using some genomics assisted breeding

529
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,960
approaches to breed for resistance to

530
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,200
those diseases as well uh so thank you

531
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,640
all for for your time uh at the moment

532
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,480
my lab is myself and darinda young who

533
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,038
has been instrumental getting the lab

534
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,640
set up as as my lab manager and I'll be

535
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,919
recruiting students and a postu and a

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,919
technician as well thank

537
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,240
you okay great thanks so much any

538
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,440
questions for

539
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
great six

540
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,400
weeks within the tomato leaf pathogen

541
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,038
you said there race one and two or two

542
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,080
different races is there much genetic

543
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,359
diversity within a race or between races

544
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,599
uh there is question yes the question

545
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,319
was in the tomato leaf mold pathogen the

546
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,879
nature of the genetic variation within

547
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,720
and between

548
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,720
races um we yes there there was quite a

549
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,640
bit of genetic variation we found

550
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,319
evidence for both sexual and asexual

551
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,640
reproduction and it didn't seem like

552
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,158
that genetic variation was necessarily

553
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,278
partitioned uh by race which kind of

554
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,440
makes sense given that these race

555
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:38,278
nomenclatures are governed by maybe a

556
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,480
single single team I question

557
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:43,400
about so in terms of think

558
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,400
about are there

559
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
distinct

560
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:55,879
ches uh that that that's that's a great

561
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:58,798
question um sure so the question was uh

562
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,600
uh the specific disease uh issues

563
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,558
related to Urban agriculture as as

564
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,158
opposed to more traditional open field

565
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,720
agriculture that's something that I'm

566
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,200
hoping to learn um I I I don't know

567
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,960
exactly there there there definitely are

568
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,319
very strong environmental influences on

569
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,960
the diseases that are um uh relevant in

570
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,240
tomato production in in green houses and

571
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,319
high tunnels things like leaf mold and

572
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,038
powdery mildew can be problems whereas

573
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,200
they tend not to be issues in the field

574
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,798
so I expect there to be similar uh

575
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:34,360
challenges in urban environments as well

576
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:37,319
Bill one another is the origin Center of

577
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,319
origin

578
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:44,599
plant it's it's been I'm sorry I keep

579
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,798
forgetting yeah the question was the

580
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,959
center of origin of eggplant uh and

581
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,558
there's actually been really recent

582
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,038
research on this um the the hypothesis

583
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,759
according to this recent study that came

584
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,440
out is that uh the center of origin is

585
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,879
southeast Asia uh it migrated from there

586
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,120
to India where it had kind of a

587
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,919
secondary domestication event there and

588
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,918
then migrated from there to Europe and

589
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,798
Africa this has been a production of

590
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,798
Cornell University on the web at
