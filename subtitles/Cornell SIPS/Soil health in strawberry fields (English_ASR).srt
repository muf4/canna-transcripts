1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:09,780
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:11,790
University all right thanks much for the

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:15,259
introduction and thanks all of you for

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,039
coming here to see this presentation

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,230
unfortunately I don't have a nice

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,829
British accent like our speaker last

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,079
last week but I think it'll still be

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,059
hopefully interested in in what I have

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,189
to say especially because it has to do

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,479
with strawberries and I think most of

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,969
you are enjoying some strawberry

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,579
products right now so we can all

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,579
appreciate how to produce better

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,070
strawberries and more strawberries like

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,979
Marvin mentioned I'm doing soil health

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,490
and strawberry fields specifically soil

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:50,969
biological health and how how we manage

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,980
our so that field affects the biological

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,409
health indicators so I'm just going to

20
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,919
kind of go through my research the issue

21
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:03,419
that we saw and then show you some of my

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,570
results so the first thing I want to do

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,219
is define soil health usually when

24
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,829
people talk about soil health they like

25
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,679
to put this Venn diagram up and say that

26
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,069
soil health is at the intersection of

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,900
your chemical your physical and your

28
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:20,369
biological soil components and they say

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,359
soil health is right there in the middle

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,609
and that's true soil help does fall in

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,620
the middle of all these different soil

32
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,939
components however I don't think that

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,920
this diagram does a great job

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,709
distinguishing the difference between a

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,030
typical soil test and a soil health test

36
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:42,599
so for example pH which is a typical

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:46,140
soil test that we'd run you'd say that's

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,298
chemical however when you think about it

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,070
the plants that grow in that soil and

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,560
the microbes that live in that soil

41
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,478
affect the pH and likewise the pH of

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,219
that soil affects the plants and the

43
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,140
microbes that can grow in that soil so

44
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,959
really pH is somewhere in this gray area

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,000
here and it for another example

46
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,890
aggregation that's okay we'd say that's

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,319
a physical component of your soil but

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,049
then aggregation is helped by bacteria

49
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,060
usage l's and fungal mycelium that help

50
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:14,099
hold the our gets together so really

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,819
aggregation is also in this gray

52
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,530
area here so my idea is that while soil

53
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,019
health does fall the intersection of

54
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:26,219
these three most soil soil tests fall

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,969
somewhere there so to really explain

56
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:33,180
soil health I prefer to use the

57
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:35,400
definition that was created by the soil

58
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,390
science society of america at their

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,849
committee on soil quality so they define

60
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,399
soil health as the capacity of a

61
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,359
specific kind of soil to function within

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,420
both managed and natural ecosystems to

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,440
sustain plant and animal productivity

64
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,989
and we want to maintain an or enhance

65
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,419
water and air quality and support human

66
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,430
habitation so there's kind of a lot in

67
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,859
that definition and it might be hard to

68
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,020
visualize just reading all of those

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,450
words so if I were to make a Venn

70
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,150
diagram of soil health it would be more

71
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,129
like this I'd say that first and

72
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,039
foremost we have to define what our soil

73
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:19,079
function is so are we growing something

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,769
on these strawberries are on the on the

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,840
soil or do we want to support a park or

76
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,300
do we want to build a building what is

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,640
the function of that soil and then once

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,420
you define that function we want it to

79
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,819
have ecosystem sustainability and we

80
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,669
want it to maintain our air and water

81
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,620
quality and then because we're a little

82
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,629
bit egocentric we needed to support

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,340
humans if it doesn't support us we're

84
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,740
not going to manage that soil that way

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,460
for very long so it's a critical

86
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,080
component of a healthy soil and at that

87
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,570
intersection there which is a little bit

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,070
maybe smaller of an overlap that's where

89
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:01,650
we we have a really healthy soil you

90
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:05,219
might notice that most of these all four

91
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,379
of these are somewhat defined components

92
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,870
of soil we and we get to define them

93
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:14,000
from so we get to say what the soil

94
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,530
function is and we get to say how it

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,569
supporting humans which makes a lot of

96
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,179
people a little bit a lot of scientists

97
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,259
a little bit nervous about it because

98
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,050
that means that since we're defining

99
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,879
them that

100
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,490
these definitions can shift with time

101
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,639
and political and social movements so

102
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,129
for example air and water quality right

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,990
now climate change and problem in the

104
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,689
future climate change will also be a big

105
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,720
issue so we're concerned about carbon

106
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,769
dioxide emissions but a while back and

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,750
who knows what will happen in the future

108
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:45,668
carbon dioxide emissions weren't really

109
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,038
what we're concerned about so today

110
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:51,490
carbon dioxide emissions might be part

111
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,709
of a healthy soil but in the future

112
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,319
maybe in the past they weren't so you

113
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,628
can see that we kind of get to put

114
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,759
emphasis on what we want so the help

115
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:08,710
healthy soil definition kind of shift so

116
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,419
it can be a little difficult in our case

117
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,908
we're looking at healthy soil in a

118
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:14,769
strawberry field so that soil function

119
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:17,589
that we've defined is to produce

120
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:19,750
strawberries and then that ecosystem

121
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:22,060
sustainability what we want it to do is

122
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,819
to provide a good habitat for soil

123
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,709
microbes and hopefully that can help us

124
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,770
reduce external inputs to the system

125
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,468
because we won't have to add fertilizers

126
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:34,538
as often or external fertilizers if the

127
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:36,519
soil microbial community can do a good

128
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:41,110
job of cycling nutrients back through

129
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,968
the soil we also hope that it the good

130
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,069
soil microbial community will cut back

131
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:48,060
on disease incidence and we won't have

132
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:51,129
to put as many pesticides on the field

133
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,259
we still want this soil to maintain air

134
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,449
and water quality and we need it to be

135
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,009
profitable it's not profitable a grower

136
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:00,848
can't continue to grow strawberries that

137
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:04,860
way so that's kind of our soil health

138
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:04,860
goal that's what we want our soil to do

139
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,829
unfortunately there's no way to just

140
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,829
measure all four of those bullet points

141
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:14,378
if with one test there's no this is a

142
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,228
soil health test so what we do is we

143
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,750
define our goal and then we have to come

144
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:22,000
up with the desired soil functions that

145
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,098
will get us to that goal so for example

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,978
a desired soil function that we might

147
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:29,468
have would be to increase that soil

148
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:31,829
microbial community then we choose

149
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:35,569
indicators that measure that soil

150
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:38,748
desired function so indicators that

151
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:41,119
might measure soil microbial community

152
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:44,059
could be respiration or chloroform

153
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:46,099
fumigation and then we run that

154
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:48,499
indicator test and we get a value from

155
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:51,588
that so let's say we run a respiration

156
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,599
test and we get a value of you know 10

157
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:55,819
milliliters okay what does that mean

158
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,759
that that's that's meaningless until we

159
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,338
value it so then we put that indicator

160
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,619
value onto through a scoring function

161
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,928
and we score it based on whether we want

162
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:07,909
more of that more of that indicator

163
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:09,649
whether we want less of that indicator

164
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:12,649
or whether we want that indicator to

165
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:15,019
fall within a specific range and once it

166
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,610
has a score we can combine all the

167
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,158
scores of all the indicators that we

168
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,249
test that we've run and we get a final

169
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:24,949
soil quality score so there's no way to

170
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:27,409
jump directly from here to here but we

171
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,119
can break this out kind of tease it

172
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,490
apart and then hopefully combine it back

173
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:33,830
together to get our soil quality score

174
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,059
and hopefully we've chosen our

175
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:39,740
indicators appropriately so that they're

176
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:42,800
they accurately give a soil quality

177
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,718
score that represents the soil in our

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,009
field so it can be a little bit

179
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:47,748
difficult making sure that we've

180
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,629
selected all these correct indicators

181
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:54,430
and and that our soil quality score

182
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,430
relates back to this soil health goal

183
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,559
when we're choosing soil health

184
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:02,389
indicators there are a couple different

185
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:04,309
parameters first and foremost they have

186
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,718
to accurately target that soil function

187
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:08,629
that we're interested in because if

188
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,819
they're not different about targeting

189
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,709
that that function then then it's and

190
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,088
it's somewhat meaningless but they also

191
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,699
have to be quick to respond to

192
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,519
management practices because if we

193
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,559
change our management practice but the

194
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,329
indicator test doesn't respond we could

195
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:25,099
be degrading our soil for many years

196
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:27,559
before we realize that we have to go

197
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:29,269
back and make some changes it's also

198
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:34,038
important for them to be inexpensive

199
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:35,899
reliable and fast so that could be

200
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,028
tricky and I think that as soil health

201
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,179
tests become more and more popular that

202
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:44,379
people will learn which indicators are

203
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,379
more useful

204
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,310
back in 2008 Cornell created their own

205
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,809
soil health training manual and it's

206
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:55,939
available to growers and like I

207
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,769
mentioned they had to choose indicators

208
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,480
and they are upgrading their indicator

209
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,199
so that they're more applicable to a

210
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,759
healthy soil when I started it's the

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,230
indicators that were in a soil health

212
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:12,289
tests are different from the indicators

213
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,080
that are there now and if we look at

214
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:17,689
their test score card that they give you

215
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,280
if you get a cornell soil health test we

216
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,100
can see that it kind of follows that

217
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,649
flow chart that I showed you a couple

218
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,960
slides ago so here we've got our

219
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:29,059
chemical or biological and our physical

220
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,160
components of our soil and those would

221
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,489
be the desired soil functions that they

222
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,389
want the soil to complete and then

223
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,889
they've chosen indicators here that

224
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,980
indicate those three different functions

225
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:45,740
so for example one of the biological

226
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,389
functions we want our soil to function

227
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,580
well biologically so they've said

228
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,529
percent organic matter is an indicator

229
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,110
of how well your soil will function

230
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:58,399
biologically and then they write on that

231
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,409
test and they got a value of 2.6 that

232
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,730
value of 2.6 we don't really know what

233
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:04,579
that means yet until we run it through a

234
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,009
scoring function and and we score based

235
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,820
on whether we want more less or specific

236
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:14,389
range so they wanted more of percent

237
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,790
organic matter and since 2.6 is somewhat

238
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:21,409
low they only gave it a rating so a

239
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:24,019
score of 25 and their rating scale goes

240
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:26,539
from 1 to 100 1 being the least

241
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:30,710
desirable and 100 being the most

242
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:34,189
desirable so you can see here we have a

243
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:37,100
100 for pho 104 extractable phosphorus

244
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,410
but go all the way down to 94

245
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:43,610
potentially mineralized vil nitrogen so

246
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:45,740
they score those each indicator and then

247
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,680
they combine them to an overall soil

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,579
quality score this soil got a score of

249
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,409
64 and

250
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:56,818
so that's kind of how it looks in

251
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:59,909
reality but the Cornell soil health test

252
00:10:56,818 --> 00:11:02,188
was developed mostly mainly on grain and

253
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,198
vegetable crops but my advisor Marvin

254
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:07,019
wanted to try and make it more

255
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:08,849
applicable to Barry growers since we

256
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,058
want to encourage bear growers to also

257
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,170
have healthy soil and if any of you are

258
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:15,659
interested this is a yellow collar

259
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:19,669
that's being developed in Geneva so we

260
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,669
can be proud of our beautiful collards

261
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,039
when Marvin gave Cornell soil health

262
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,948
test to Barry growers across upstate New

263
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,599
York trying to make sure that this test

264
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:34,198
was applicable to Barry growers and get

265
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,798
them excited about it we looked at the

266
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:40,678
strawberry grower data on its own and

267
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:42,208
noticed that the biological soil health

268
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:44,850
indicators from those tests all came

269
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:47,698
back very low so you can see these are

270
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,170
the biological indicators that we looked

271
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:50,969
at organic matter active carbon

272
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:53,009
potentially mineralized while nitrogen

273
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,319
and we can see that their indicator

274
00:11:53,009 --> 00:12:00,629
ratings on that scale from 1 to 100 are

275
00:11:55,318 --> 00:12:03,479
all kind of below 30 so they had pretty

276
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:05,009
low soil biological health and we were a

277
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,619
little bit confused by this because

278
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,449
strawberry growers add a lot of organic

279
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:11,939
matter to their fields through straw

280
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:14,909
what they'll do is they'll put straw in

281
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:18,118
their fields in the fall and when you

282
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:20,969
when you pile straw pit traps a lot of

283
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:24,989
air and acts as a really great insulator

284
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:28,860
for for the plants so they'll put the

285
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:31,290
straw on in the winter and if they've

286
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,918
piled enough on there you can see that

287
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:36,899
they have nice undamaged flowers in the

288
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:39,448
spring however if they don't put enough

289
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,938
on or they don't insulate their their

290
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:43,828
plants they can get cold damage

291
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:49,198
especially in the early spring like we

292
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:51,539
see here with this black flower so they

293
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,979
they put them on in the fall they let

294
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,599
them over winter and then in the spring

295
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,600
the growers will come and they'll rake

296
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,220
the straw between the rows and then the

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,619
straw that was once an insulator then

298
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,170
becomes a mulch and this mulch layer is

299
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,910
really

300
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:07,028
Martin because it keeps it keeps the

301
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:09,129
berries up off the dirt off the soil the

302
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:11,049
soil carries a lot of very diseases and

303
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,689
if the soil can't reach the berry then

304
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:17,019
it doesn't get those diseases so it's a

305
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,300
really important layer between between

306
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,730
the soil and the berry it also keeps the

307
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:24,039
berries clean and that's important

308
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,600
because the strawberry grower can't wash

309
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,969
their berries before they ship their

310
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,430
berries if they were to wash their

311
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,860
berries before shipping them by the time

312
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:35,888
it reached the consumer the berries

313
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,019
would be rotted but on the other hand no

314
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,539
consumer is going to want to buy dirty

315
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,600
berries so having those clean berries

316
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:45,789
where the soil can't bounce up on onto

317
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,759
them from the rain is really important

318
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:51,399
so we're adding a lot of organic matter

319
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,439
to these systems nonetheless we have low

320
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,958
soil biological health it was a little

321
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,060
bit confusing however we know that straw

322
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,518
has a really high carbon to nitrogen

323
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,208
ratio and it's been shown in other

324
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,948
studies that carbon nitrogen radio ratio

325
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:11,229
especially when high can have a negative

326
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:13,899
effect on soil biological health this is

327
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,240
a graph from a different experiment but

328
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:19,690
if we just focus on two lines here we've

329
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,230
got broccoli residue in the solid black

330
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:26,019
line and this dotted line is broccoli

331
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,570
residue plus wheat straw so broccoli

332
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,639
residue on its own has a very low carbon

333
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,649
to nitrogen ratio but broccoli residue

334
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,740
plus wheat straw has a much higher

335
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:38,828
carbon to nitrogen ratio and then on

336
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,740
this y-axis here we have net nitrogen

337
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:44,169
mineralization and you can see that the

338
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,698
zero no nitrogen mineralization is right

339
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:50,229
is right here so if we have that low

340
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,509
carbon to nitrogen ratio amendment the

341
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,870
broccoli we can see that we're having

342
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:58,000
positive net nitrogen mineralization so

343
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,370
if we put on that higher carbon nitrogen

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,198
amendment where we add in the wheat

345
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,959
straw we can see that we actually have

346
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,799
negative nitrogen mineralization meaning

347
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,439
that we're having nitrogen

348
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:11,409
immobilization and so that's indicating

349
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,000
that there's poor biological soil health

350
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,759
it's not it's not the goal that we want

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,549
we want more

352
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,500
generateur soil not less so we were

353
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,870
thinking that the high carbon to

354
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,490
nitrogen ratio of straw was possibly

355
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:30,919
having a negative effect on the plants

356
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:34,100
or on the soil health oops strawberry

357
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:38,269
growers also typically use cultivation

358
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,639
to deal with their weeds a lot of

359
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:42,829
herbicides target broadleaf perennial

360
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,289
plants and unfortunately strawberries

361
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,570
are also broadleaf perennial plants so

362
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:51,169
instead of using her besides they often

363
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,460
will just cultivate until their soil but

364
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:54,889
there have been a lot of studies showing

365
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,629
that cultivation can have a negative

366
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:01,759
impact on soil biology so here we're

367
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:05,899
looking again at a study from somebody

368
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,200
else but the two treatments to your left

369
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:11,569
are no-till treatments and the two

370
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,150
treatments to your right these are

371
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,879
conventionally tilled treatments and I

372
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:19,129
just want to point out that the no-till

373
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,990
treatments have a lot more fungal hyphae

374
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:25,340
than the conventionally tilled

375
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:28,250
treatments so you can just see that

376
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,590
tilling can decrease soil biological

377
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,059
life and therefore we thought maybe that

378
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,620
the high intensity of tilling at

379
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:38,389
Strawberry Fields was also having a

380
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,210
negative effect so what we did is we

381
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:43,639
designed an experiment out here in East

382
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,200
Ithaca where we put on four different

383
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,350
well we had four different soil

384
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,080
amendment treatments along a carbon to

385
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,820
nitrogen ratio scale so you can see

386
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,889
sawdust had a very high carbon to

387
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,600
nitrogen ratio and then straw was

388
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,549
somewhere in the middle and then grass

389
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,909
at a very low carbon to nitrogen ratio

390
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:04,759
and we and then we also had an unmanned

391
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:09,259
'add control we put those amendments on

392
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:11,390
the soil in fall of 2013 and then we

393
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:14,720
tilled them into the soil and then in

394
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,630
the spring of 2014 we planted honey why

395
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,890
strawberries on that field I want to

396
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,990
make it clear that this is not what a

397
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,060
grower would do a grower would just

398
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,740
simply plant their strawberries directly

399
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,629
into the field

400
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,579
spring and then apply that straw it for

401
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,880
winter protection in the late fall early

402
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:36,428
summer and then would rake that straw

403
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,900
into the rose in the next spring and

404
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,210
then as they tilled that would

405
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,980
eventually become a soil amendment but

406
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,840
we wanted since I'm only going to be

407
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,880
here for two and a half years we wanted

408
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,829
to get a little bit of a jump start so

409
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,120
we applied the amendments to the soil

410
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:55,470
right away to try to see if we could

411
00:17:51,119 --> 00:18:04,959
make differences in our soil health

412
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:07,750
indicators more quickly and then we this

413
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,990
is this is your he was department here

414
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:15,190
at the time so what a typical department

415
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:19,660
chair does are you ready Steve to do

416
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,308
that but um anyway so we had two

417
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,110
different tillage treatments as well we

418
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,079
tilled half of our plots as shallow as

419
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:29,409
possible and then we tilled half of our

420
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:32,710
plots about a foot deep here you can see

421
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,019
us tilling with the what is it the

422
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:40,990
Reggie wieder leader rotary cultivator

423
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:43,029
so yeah this is a picture of our plot

424
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,319
map and you can see the four different

425
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,599
soil amendments that we added are

426
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,178
indicated by the different colors we've

427
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,439
got unda mended treatments in blue we've

428
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:55,330
got graphs amended treatments and green

429
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,610
straw amended treatments in that brown

430
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,428
color and then sawdust a minute

431
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:05,019
treatments in purple and then we hatched

432
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:06,460
the plots that are that or deep tilled

433
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:09,779
and then the ones that aren't hatched

434
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,779
are shallow tilled treatments

435
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:17,869
I wanted to give you a quick timeline of

436
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,690
what we did so that just to make sure

437
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:23,779
everyone's on the same page again we

438
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,750
applied these we applied the soil

439
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:28,940
amendments in the fall of 2013 and then

440
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,829
we let them over winter we didn't take

441
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,809
the first soil sample until the next May

442
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:36,079
and then we planted our strawberries

443
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,789
actually after our first soil sample and

444
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,919
then we took our second and third soil

445
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:44,720
samples and again applied more

446
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,360
amendments in the fall of 2014 we let

447
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,970
those over winter and then in May again

448
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,019
we took a for soil sample harvested the

449
00:19:49,970 --> 00:20:00,200
berries in June of 2015 and then took

450
00:19:54,019 --> 00:20:02,900
our fifth soil sample in August we

451
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,819
didn't want to confound our amendment

452
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,070
study by putting straw on for winter

453
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:09,069
protection so instead of using straw we

454
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:12,230
used row cover so you can see that here

455
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:13,730
to let him make sure that you know that

456
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,319
we didn't use straw even though growers

457
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,789
often do they can also use row cover and

458
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,369
then every time we took a soil sample we

459
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,779
looked at five different soil parameters

460
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:28,369
we did a soil respiration test we did a

461
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:31,569
potentially min risible nitrogen test a

462
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:35,019
carbon to nitrogen ratio test pH and

463
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:35,019
soil moisture

464
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:41,389
and then before I start talking about

465
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,320
data there's one more thing that I want

466
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,840
to explain so we weren't sure if we

467
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,759
should sample between the rows where we

468
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,369
were actually applying the amendments

469
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,529
and we were actually you know

470
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,509
cultivating or if we should sample

471
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,670
within the rows where the strawberries

472
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,009
were actually growing so we weren't we

473
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,740
weren't sure which would be have a

474
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:06,230
greater effect on the soil health

475
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,470
parameters so what we did is we sampled

476
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,539
in both and kept them separate so that's

477
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,009
why when you look at these tables you

478
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,379
see an amendment treatment and then a

479
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,170
tillage depth treatment and then you see

480
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,910
a sample location treatment and we

481
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,910
didn't have a sample location treatment

482
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,380
this first sample date because we didn't

483
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,390
have any strawberries so there weren't

484
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,520
any rows to sample between Earth in so

485
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,690
we just sampled that date and then for

486
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,990
all the rest of the dates there's

487
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,150
there's this additional sample location

488
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,710
treatment which indicates whether we

489
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,840
sampled between the rows are within the

490
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:43,670
roast and so here we're looking at our

491
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:45,379
respiration data you can see the five

492
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,700
different sample dates all the way to

493
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,560
the left and then we've got into not

494
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,150
significant data is indicated all the

495
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,579
way to the right here with an NS and

496
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,870
then these are these are p values that

497
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:59,269
we've showed you that are that are

498
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,549
significant and you can see that

499
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:05,839
amendment often has a significant effect

500
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:08,029
on soil respiration but tillage step

501
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,399
does not we also see a slight

502
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,079
interaction effect between the amendment

503
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,370
and the sample location here on the

504
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:19,039
second date so what does that mean we

505
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:21,619
take a look at the graph here you can

506
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,529
see our on our y-axis we've got the

507
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:27,109
milliliters of co2 respired and then

508
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,029
down here on the x-axis we've got each

509
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,829
sample date and then the first sample

510
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:32,539
date we only have between data because

511
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,189
we didn't have rows and then every other

512
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:36,349
sample date we have both between and

513
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,539
within and within is kind of a little

514
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:41,449
bit grayer if that helps you see this

515
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,119
graph a little bit better and we've got

516
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,150
our four different soil amendments

517
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:51,279
unamended grass straw and sawdust so we

518
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,440
noticed that sawdust often had higher

519
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,440
respiration than any of the other

520
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,870
treatments but if you remember from that

521
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,840
chart the second sample date had an

522
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:04,209
interaction effect between the soil

523
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,149
amendment and the sample location so we

524
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,100
can see that within straw had the

525
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,080
highest respiration but between the rows

526
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,730
straw and sawdust had actually the same

527
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,789
respiration so that's where we get that

528
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,279
interaction effect coming into play so

529
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,420
we thought this was really interesting

530
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,089
but we were a little concerned because

531
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,429
we're adding sawdust and sawdust has a

532
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:25,720
really high carbon to nitrogen ratio so

533
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,059
we're adding an amendment with a lot of

534
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,470
carbon so you'd think well obviously we

535
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:31,990
can get more carbon dioxide if we're

536
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,049
adding more carbon to the system so

537
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,329
we've decided we were going to try to

538
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,678
fix that and we changed our y-axis from

539
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:43,299
total milliliters of carbon dioxide

540
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,309
emitted to grams of carbon respired per

541
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:48,220
gram of carbon in the soil because we

542
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:51,428
had measured the carbon in the soil as

543
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,640
well for each sample so it is the same

544
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,530
chart but with a different y-axis and we

545
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,750
can see that the the graph looks pretty

546
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,639
much the same usually we still have

547
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,890
highest the highest respiration in our

548
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,340
saudis amended soil except on this

549
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,840
second sample date straw has higher

550
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:12,689
respiration both both between and within

551
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,689
the rose so that was kind of interesting

552
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,690
then we took a look at our potentially

553
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:23,638
mineralize abul nitrogen data and we can

554
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,979
see that once again until its def had no

555
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:29,308
significant effect on any of our on

556
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:32,109
potentially mineralized able nitrogen

557
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:35,229
but amendment did but it mostly had an

558
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:38,048
effect in the two springs and then a

559
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:40,389
slight a slight amendment and sample

560
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:45,538
location interaction effect in the

561
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:48,638
summer of 2015 so if we look at that

562
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:51,429
graphically again that first sample date

563
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:53,138
it's interesting we see pi potentially

564
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,589
mineralized able again in the straw the

565
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:59,108
sawdust amended treatment so that kind

566
00:24:56,588 --> 00:25:02,440
of lined up with our respiration data

567
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:04,148
and I was I was interesting but then the

568
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,838
second spring we didn't see that same

569
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:11,558
that's that same line up so we can see

570
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:15,428
that sawdust does have high respiration

571
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:19,509
but it is tied with the grass and the

572
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,919
straw amended soil and then I like I

573
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:24,069
mentioned we had that slight interaction

574
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:27,070
effect on the final sample date so you

575
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:28,538
can see that between and within had

576
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,888
slightly different responses for

577
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:31,888
potentially mineralize about nitrogen

578
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,359
and if we now look at our carbon and

579
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:41,720
nitrogen data there is no real

580
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,969
significant interact effect of any of

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,450
our treatments on carbon and nitrogen

582
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,309
ratio so the reason this is really

583
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,529
interesting is because even though we

584
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,329
were adding soil amendments with vastly

585
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:56,629
different carbon and nitrogen ratios to

586
00:25:53,329 --> 00:26:00,169
our soil it wasn't coming through in the

587
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,870
soil itself so in if we had continued

588
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:06,560
this study for many years or if we had

589
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:08,149
added vastly more of our soil amendment

590
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,599
we might expect to see that carbon to

591
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:14,030
nitrogen ratio differ between the

592
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,589
treatments but apparently the amount

593
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:19,000
that we added for the time that we added

594
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:21,409
it there was no difference in that ratio

595
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,759
this is also really interesting because

596
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:27,560
remember if you remember back to

597
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:29,599
respiration we changed our respiration y

598
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:33,139
axis from total milliliters of carbon

599
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,089
dioxide to grams of carbon emitted

600
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,170
through a respiration per gram of carbon

601
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:40,490
in the soil and we can see that there

602
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,980
was no real difference between our

603
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,210
different soil treatments in the carbon

604
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,339
in the amount of carbon and nitrogen

605
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,740
that was in the soil so even though we

606
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:50,209
made that conversion since we didn't see

607
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,069
differences in carbon and nitrogen ratio

608
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,380
data we didn't really see any

609
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,539
differences in those two graphs when we

610
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,400
change the y axis so that might be part

611
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:04,519
of the reason why the respiration looked

612
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:06,350
the same depending looked at it when we

613
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,379
looked at ph there were no differences

614
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:13,129
in pH based on any of the treatments

615
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,510
that we applied however we when we we

616
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,930
looked between the rows and within the

617
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:21,769
rose we could see differences so at

618
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,990
first the well this this sample date

619
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:27,190
here they were the same however after

620
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:30,019
that within the Rose had lower pH then

621
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,240
between the rows and this makes sense

622
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:36,049
because when we fertilized we used urea

623
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,759
and we did we did banded fertilization

624
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,558
we didn't broadcast the fertilizer we

625
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,230
just put it right next to the plants so

626
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,298
and and urea can slightly acidify your

627
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,669
soil and I think we're seeing part of

628
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:49,470
that effect here also in plants up

629
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:52,559
taking nutrients are emitting they can

630
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,909
emit some acidic compounds and slightly

631
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,648
acidify the soil and I think the

632
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:59,059
combination of those two is the reason

633
00:27:55,648 --> 00:28:01,258
why we're seeing more acidic soil in

634
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:03,178
between there within the rows then

635
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:08,700
between thought that was kind of cool

636
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:11,929
the seat so we'll moisture again we look

637
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,769
and we don't really see any pattern of

638
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,710
differences based on our different

639
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:20,669
treatments there are some significant

640
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:23,639
effects but it was not consistent so we

641
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:26,309
can't really say say much about soil

642
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:28,888
moisture we think this might just have

643
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:31,648
to do to the fact that slow moisture is

644
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:35,189
pretty variable it can change from day

645
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:38,518
to day and from location to location

646
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,740
depending upon what the soil what it's

647
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,230
covered with and and who's drawing

648
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,778
moisture out of that soil so we didn't

649
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:51,179
really see much of interest with soil

650
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:53,398
moisture so the first question that we

651
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,288
really wanted to answer was do soil

652
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,569
amendments and tillage depth have an

653
00:28:55,288 --> 00:29:00,450
effect on soil biological health

654
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:03,808
indicators and what we can say yes and

655
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:06,569
no yes amendment had an effect on

656
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:09,599
respiration and potentially mineralized

657
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:11,579
well nitrogen but tillage duck didn't

658
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,480
really have an effect on any of our soil

659
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,480
health indicators

660
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:21,579
but we also wanted to look at yield and

661
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:25,640
if you guys remember back to the

662
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:27,470
timeline that i showed the yield we only

663
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,110
took we only harvested the berries once

664
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,009
so we only have one set of yield data

665
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:35,029
just to keep that in the back of your

666
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:37,369
mind but we here you can see our

667
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:39,079
amendment and our depth treatments and

668
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:41,089
we tried to see if there was an effect

669
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,949
on the marketable yield and the plant

670
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:45,339
the plant density and you can see that

671
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,830
there is both an effect of amendment on

672
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:50,539
marketable yield and plant density so if

673
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,419
we come down here and we look at our

674
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:56,509
marketable yield straw had a

675
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,980
significantly lower yield than any of

676
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:00,619
the other amendments that we added to

677
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,410
our soil as well as it had significantly

678
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:05,589
lower plant density than the other

679
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,929
amendments that we added to the soil

680
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:10,220
this was surprising because well first

681
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,840
of all it's not along that carbon to

682
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,190
nitrogen ratio scale that we had at

683
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,349
first thought was going to be the issue

684
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,940
we thought that if straw had lower

685
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:19,129
yields that sawdust would have even

686
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:24,320
lower yield but that didn't seem to be

687
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:27,230
the case and straws also what growers

688
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,299
typically use so they might not realize

689
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,920
that the they're not producing

690
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:34,009
strawberries to the fullest potential

691
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,050
yield that they could get we calculated

692
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:39,710
it and it would was about a twenty

693
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:45,169
percent decrease in Los and profits and

694
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:46,940
yield so that's pretty significant you

695
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,220
could you could even see it out in the

696
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,370
field I know this is not the best

697
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:56,089
picture but if you look here this is a

698
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:58,189
straw amended plot as well as here here

699
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,949
there that's them right over in that

700
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,480
corner there and it's really hard to see

701
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,980
the plants in those plots that's why

702
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,990
they're kind of easy to pick out and

703
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,670
it's true that the straw is kind of

704
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,609
mounded up and that may be one reason

705
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,950
why you can't see the plant the plants

706
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:15,529
very well in this pitcher but also the

707
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,970
plants were very short and small and and

708
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:19,190
and that's another reason why you can't

709
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,829
see the plants so well miss pitcher and

710
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,870
the straw amended plots

711
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,788
if you look at it this way it might be a

712
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:28,189
little easier to see in the middle we

713
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:29,869
have our straw amended soil on the

714
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,580
bottom we have our unamended soil and

715
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:34,038
then on the top we have our sawdust

716
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,629
amended soil and all these plants were

717
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,259
planted on the same day and the same

718
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:42,309
distance apart and it's pretty visually

719
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:45,740
clear that the straw amended soil

720
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:48,019
produced smaller plants or they grew

721
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,909
slower than the rest of the unamended

722
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,740
and the sawdust amended treatments as

723
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,539
well as the grass but graphs we expected

724
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,109
to have good growth because it had a lot

725
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:58,849
of nitrogen but we didn't expect straw

726
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:01,009
to actually decrease growth which it

727
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:03,168
seemed to do because our unamended soil

728
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:09,679
had had better growth than than the

729
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:11,419
straw metod soil I know yeah and that's

730
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,130
even one of the reasons that's one of

731
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,960
the hypotheses of why we named

732
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,000
strawberries strawberries because we

733
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,200
grow them in straw so what are we going

734
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,259
to do I don't know if we're gonna have

735
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:27,100
to rename them or yeah wheat yeah we'd

736
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,099
straw yes sorry

737
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,930
yeah so so good question well I'm going

738
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,769
to get to that question in two slides is

739
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,630
that ok ok so uh the first thing I

740
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,490
wanted to point out is that even though

741
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,710
we saw these decreased yields and we saw

742
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,720
the decreased density we are not going

743
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,579
to recommend to growers currently that

744
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,380
they should stop using straw because if

745
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,720
you remember the beginning straw has a

746
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,730
lot of benefits it insulates the berries

747
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,680
and then it provides that nice thick

748
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,599
mulch layer between the soil and the

749
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,549
berry and that not only decreases

750
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:01,119
diseases it also keeps the berries clean

751
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,829
so here on our y-axis now this is a good

752
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,359
thing we have grams of unmarketable

753
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:06,009
strawberries and you can see that our

754
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,009
unmarketable strawberries in the straw

755
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,950
minutes well we're much lower so if I

756
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,839
have shown you total yield data that

757
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,519
when I two slides ago or think three

758
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,079
sides ago the the differences between

759
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,609
the straw and the sawdust and the grass

760
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,099
amount of treatments would have been

761
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:24,879
much greater but you can see how much

762
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:26,678
straw decreased disease so it still has

763
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
a lot of benefits you can also see it

764
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,920
keeping the strawberry up off the soil

765
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,500
you can't see the soil in this picture

766
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,690
because you know there's a nice thick

767
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,339
layer and that's really important for

768
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,029
Barry growers before they ship for when

769
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:42,009
they ship their berries now we don't

770
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:44,799
think that it's okay to have reduced

771
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:47,019
yields so we tried this past winter to

772
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,089
figure out what it was that was

773
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:50,558
decreasing yield what mechanism in the

774
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:52,329
straw was actually causing this

775
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,569
decreased yield we came up with a couple

776
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:57,220
different ideas the first being just

777
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,599
like James pointed out we thought maybe

778
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,120
it's a chemical leak Jake because wheat

779
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:04,299
straw has been shown to have leelah

780
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,919
pathak effects on other plans we also

781
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:10,329
were thinking maybe it was some kind of

782
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,918
microbial community maybe the straw was

783
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:13,148
encouraging a microbial community to

784
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,029
grow there that that was actually

785
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:17,230
detrimental to strawberry plant growth

786
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,060
we thought that maybe there was like a

787
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,090
physical barrier like when the when the

788
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,469
strawberry plants were sending out their

789
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,519
daughter plants their runners and then

790
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:26,349
the daughter plants are trying to send

791
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,809
down those roots that the roots couldn't

792
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:32,378
make it out to the soil quick enough and

793
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:33,699
that was decreasing growth or we thought

794
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:37,128
maybe there was some kind of herbicide

795
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:39,528
residue left over on that straw that was

796
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:41,239
then affecting those strawberry plants

797
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:43,639
because like we mentioned strawberry

798
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,939
plants are broadly perennial as our most

799
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,190
herbicide as do most herbicide target so

800
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,079
we tried all these things in the

801
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,079
greenhouse but unfortunately we weren't

802
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:56,329
actually able to recreate the negative

803
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,500
growth that we saw in the field in the

804
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,210
greenhouse which was a little bit

805
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,409
disappointing because we would really

806
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,028
hope that we'd be able to answer that

807
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:03,879
question like what is it in the straw

808
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:06,259
that's that's causing a reduced growth

809
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,670
but the greenhouse environment and the

810
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:10,548
outdoor environment are very different

811
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,960
and so you know it's possible that there

812
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:13,460
was just some key element out in the

813
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,710
field that we didn't recreate in the

814
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,289
greenhouse that was that was what would

815
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:21,318
have made us been able to answer this

816
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:24,740
question but it's really interesting and

817
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:27,259
someone hopefully will answer it so do

818
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,538
treatments affect yield again we can say

819
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:32,809
yes and no amendments do affect yield

820
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:35,539
straw can decrease yield but a tillage

821
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:38,450
didn't have much of an effect or I

822
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,430
didn't have any effect the last thing we

823
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:44,389
tried to do is you try to correlate our

824
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,460
soil health parameters with yield so you

825
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:48,318
can see here all the way to the left we

826
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,298
have marketable yield and along the top

827
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:52,639
we have our five different soil health

828
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:55,038
parameters and we were hoping that some

829
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,818
of them would be highly correlated but

830
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:01,130
we didn't really see any pattern so we

831
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:03,739
don't have anything to say about how

832
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:10,039
soil health can directly affect yield at

833
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:11,649
this time that being so so our soil

834
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,829
health indicators correlated with yield

835
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:18,500
we haven't been able to show that yet

836
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:20,539
that being said that doesn't yield falls

837
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,429
under this human support and and that

838
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,549
soil functionality it doesn't really

839
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:26,719
fall under ecosystem sustainability or

840
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:28,518
helping to maintain air and water

841
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,730
quality so we can still be increasing

842
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:33,469
our soil health overall but not

843
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,028
increasing yield and this is important

844
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:38,000
because you know we planted strawberries

845
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:40,369
in a soil that hadn't had strawberries

846
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,880
planted in it for many years it was

847
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:46,338
pretty pretty good soil and all of our

848
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,430
plants overall group grew very well so

849
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,019
there wasn't a lot of

850
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:52,119
eases built up in the soil there weren't

851
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:55,150
a lot of pests strawberry specific pests

852
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,859
living in the area so our system wasn't

853
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,660
very stressed and it'd be really

854
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,579
interesting to see what happened when

855
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:02,469
the system did become stressed that's

856
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:04,929
when a healthy soil might really help

857
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:07,359
increase yield or keep yields high where

858
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:09,609
an unhealthy soil would kind of drop off

859
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:13,930
so we think that maybe with time these

860
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:18,309
effects might might become more clear I

861
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:19,929
just wanted to quickly go over like kind

862
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:21,099
of highlight what we what we found in

863
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,509
the study because there's kind of a lot

864
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:25,779
it was a little bit all over the board

865
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:28,990
so to reiterate soil amendments do

866
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,490
affect soil health indicators but not

867
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:34,689
based on that carbon to nitrogen ratio

868
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:37,089
scale like we originally thought if they

869
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,130
had then sawdust would have had the

870
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,800
highest respiration and the highest pmn

871
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,119
and then grassman it so I would have had

872
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,530
the lowest but that's not that's not

873
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,719
what we always saw um tilling did not

874
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,970
affect the soil health indicators in our

875
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:54,519
study however was only a two year study

876
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:58,239
and most chilling experiments are long

877
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,860
term so we're thinking that but we were

878
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,869
hoping that the soil health parameters

879
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,280
would react so quickly to these

880
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:05,409
management practices that they would

881
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,690
kind of let us give us a heads up that

882
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:09,219
it was maybe degrading our soil

883
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,440
biological health but it didn't appear

884
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:16,089
to do that in the long term it would be

885
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,039
interesting to see what what happens we

886
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:20,769
saw that pH was higher between the rows

887
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:25,090
than it was within the rows which was

888
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:27,519
interesting and soil amendments do

889
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,590
affect yield but again not based on that

890
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,380
carbon to nitrogen ratio of scale so

891
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,510
sawdust or straw had the lowest yield

892
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,539
but thought us did not have even lower

893
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,540
grass did not have even higher yield so

894
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,108
again tilling did not affect yield but

895
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:48,619
like we mentioned this is only a two

896
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:50,328
year study and most chilling experiments

897
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:54,680
are long-term be interesting to see what

898
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:56,690
happens in the long term we were unable

899
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,929
to find a link between soil health and

900
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,789
yield but over time when when more

901
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:06,618
stressors enter the environment we might

902
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:08,449
be able to find the correlation and even

903
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:11,450
though straw decreased strawberry growth

904
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:13,429
and yield we were unable to figure out

905
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:16,848
exactly what it was about the straw that

906
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:19,250
was decreasing growth and so we're not

907
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:21,890
going to recommend that growers stop

908
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,300
using straw all together yet maybe if

909
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,009
they want to try using a little less

910
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,450
straw in certain parts of their field

911
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,030
although they have to make sure they put

912
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,669
enough on there to adequately insulate

913
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,380
or if they want to try using some straw

914
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,519
and another amendment in conjunction

915
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,710
with a straw maybe that would be good

916
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,710
but until we know we can't really say

917
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,838
what it is that you need to change to

918
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:46,280
get your yield back up to its full

919
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:48,289
potential and quickly before I finish I

920
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,700
just wanted to thank everyone who helped

921
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,809
make this research possible because I

922
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:52,368
certainly couldn't have done on my own

923
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,049
first and foremost I want to thank

924
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,730
Marvin who's my advisor and then

925
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,318
everyone who works with him both Casper

926
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,429
and kathy was a huge part of this

927
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:02,929
research and she's greatly missed I also

928
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:05,000
need to really thank you hon us in his

929
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:07,250
lab because he let me use his lab space

930
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,349
and with his lab space come Kelly and

931
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,789
Akio who are his technicians who also

932
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:13,400
really help whenever you have a soil

933
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:15,380
question I used some lab space in the

934
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,358
Cornell nutrient analysis laboratory and

935
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,619
Tim dodge really helped to keep those

936
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:20,869
strawberries live when they need to be

937
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:22,430
watered I couldn't have done it without

938
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,519
funding from both the hatch and

939
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:27,289
horticulture department and thank you

940
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,119
graduate students and the six

941
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:32,869
departments but mostly horticulture and

942
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,010
also my family and I think we have some

943
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:45,200
time for questions but not too much so

944
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:48,990
yeah thank you was that for that field

945
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:52,230
so can you tell us what the measurements

946
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:54,929
like soil organic net or whatever he did

947
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,940
me you know the diverse test yeah so

948
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:59,730
their success resent yeah so the first

949
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,980
test was just to kind of show you what

950
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,690
the Cornell so I helped lab does but we

951
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,269
didn't use the Cornell so a health ought

952
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,950
to do our test was when we were really

953
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,860
interested in doing a respiration test

954
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:13,589
and at the time they didn't include that

955
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,720
but now they do so we've kind of chose

956
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:19,050
our own soil help foreigners that's why

957
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:21,659
we did CNN ratio respiration pmn we

958
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:25,010
don't have those specific tests would

959
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,009
have been so

960
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,779
yeah two questions Maria first is how

961
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:35,980
much straw or sawdust or grass did you

962
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,750
apply yeah so we use the amount that a

963
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,429
strawberries or we take typically apply

964
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:44,349
which I think was like two times and

965
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:47,710
make 308 an acre to insulate and then we

966
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:50,380
drive that waited and then we added an

967
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:54,190
equivalent mass basis first sawdust and

968
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:58,539
grasp okay second question is on the I

969
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:01,240
marketable yield oil treatment had lower

970
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:03,130
our market bought you but on percentage

971
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:07,649
basis would that be the same or store

972
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:13,410
lower um I don't think I ran that but I

973
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:15,539
I don't think it

974
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:22,159
okay seemed like a good idea to express

975
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:25,579
the data on a percentage basis okay

976
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,579
thanks for the feedback

977
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:35,330
yeah well what threshold were you using

978
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,829
for the market will vary yeah so that

979
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:40,519
was interesting at the time you were

980
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:42,230
like well you can market a very that you

981
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,030
can't Martin a very them as disease this

982
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,519
summer we had a lot of disease so

983
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,100
because remember if you remember June it

984
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:52,159
rained like almost every day I maybe

985
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:55,159
every other day so anything that was

986
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,440
rotten we said that was unmarketable we

987
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,829
also never lost looks 20 times worse

988
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,659
flood damage that was not okay Barry was

989
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:05,179
broken in any way from someone stepping

990
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:08,239
on it or gonna cracked that was not okay

991
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:11,659
but at the time we were like oh if it's

992
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:14,059
dirty that's probably ok but but I don't

993
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:15,859
think so we included dirty very in our

994
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,750
marketable deal hope you probably

995
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,450
shouldn't have because in reality I'll

996
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,349
go to bury is intact and it's fine that

997
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:25,848
doesn't have

998
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:28,099
the doesn't doesn't you know the cut it

999
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,809
probably would be hard for a grower to

1000
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:31,999
market it they have to wash it and then

1001
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:35,269
sell immediately or you have to market

1002
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:37,399
envy you pick people who or okay berries

1003
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:38,629
that then they go take home and wash the

1004
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:44,630
very firm idea being that they weren't

1005
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:49,130
really good for awakeness grass used is

1006
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:53,690
mulch or as organic matter yeah so we so

1007
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:55,849
on that first fall in 2013 he

1008
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,639
incorporated that right into the soil to

1009
00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:01,009
kind of get a job start so that was more

1010
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,078
of an amendment and then the next fall

1011
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:04,579
instead of killing those amendments it

1012
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,339
would just left them on the surface of

1013
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:09,470
the soil trying to kind of emulate what

1014
00:44:07,338 --> 00:44:10,849
our strawberry girl would do because

1015
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:12,169
they wouldn't amend them and are they

1016
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:16,400
going to tilt him into the soil until

1017
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:18,588
the next spring when they needed to week

1018
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,239
so we did that we just left them on a

1019
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:22,400
soil surface and then the next spring

1020
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,220
when we needed to leave that's when we

1021
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,450
use that's when it kind of came from a

1022
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:28,449
mulch into an amendment

1023
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,460
your throw is used

1024
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,789
yeah but they don't produce them quite

1025
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,960
the same way than they do in California

1026
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:42,239
it's a little bit of a different system

1027
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,329
but they do use black basketball so

1028
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,679
that's an important option sometimes

1029
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:48,690
they still use strong meeting the Rose

1030
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,868
because it's also nice just for it you

1031
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,869
have

1032
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:57,769
yep our star peepers

1033
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,769
sorry

1034
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:03,548
how long how often they are

1035
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,119
so they'll replace their strawberry

1036
00:45:03,548 --> 00:45:08,349
plants maybe after three or four years

1037
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,420
that's when it kind of doesn't become it

1038
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:11,740
when it's not economical anymore to keep

1039
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,420
them because every time they produce

1040
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:17,439
very still produce a little bit smaller

1041
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:19,599
or a little less than next year um the

1042
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,460
recommendation is that they rotate after

1043
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,260
that three or four years but in reality

1044
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,119
that doesn't always happen a lot of

1045
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,890
times they do keep their their fields

1046
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,460
the same spot just like to grow their

1047
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:33,868
business one spot so some do they

1048
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,869
probably should some don't

1049
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:40,159
it possible that this child is keeping a

1050
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,059
slight temperature a little bit

1051
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,059
bothering action

1052
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:53,549
I guess in that in the green yeah I mean

1053
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:55,469
that exact so yeah Strom was most likely

1054
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,110
to be the temperature lower we didn't

1055
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:59,849
measure soil temperature but from other

1056
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:03,059
literature that I've got it usually does

1057
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:06,480
the soil temperature lower and then in

1058
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,159
the greenhouse yeah it was temperature

1059
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,590
was regulated so we really have those

1060
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,489
pots we're sitting up high so it has

1061
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:16,950
something to do with temperature also in

1062
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:21,779
the greenhouse community we worked hard

1063
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:22,859
too we got like longer deeper pots and

1064
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,930
tried to plant the strawberries a little

1065
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,110
lower without them being too low into

1066
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:30,239
the pot and then piling the mulch on top

1067
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,980
but we probably didn't get the same

1068
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,289
amount of mulch that we got we were able

1069
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,740
to get a feel for you really I don't

1070
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:41,360
wanna which occur does so it might also

1071
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:41,359
have to do with your mouth straw

1072
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:49,909
yeah so her vegetables and rear crops

1073
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:53,810
they're really pushing this Cornell soil

1074
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:56,359
health test for orchard systems and

1075
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:59,210
vineyard systems we've had a hard time

1076
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:02,120
really showing that that suite of tests

1077
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,880
really you know tells us very much about

1078
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:07,699
soil health so for strawberries

1079
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,180
strawberry growers should they be using

1080
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:14,149
the soil test and if not is there a

1081
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:16,460
modification that you would think would

1082
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,550
be useful to add to the Cornell test and

1083
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,710
make it useful for server herbs yeah so

1084
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:23,990
that was kind of what like originally

1085
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:28,010
motivated distance that okay you know

1086
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:29,329
should this be use for their doors can

1087
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,680
be get them excited about doesn't even

1088
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,869
need anything and that's why we were

1089
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:37,429
really hoping at the end to correlate so

1090
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:40,099
he sweat off members and deal i would

1091
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:43,869
say that there are probably benefits to

1092
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:46,009
soil hometown when we when we gave the

1093
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:48,889
sweat health test to all those berry

1094
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:52,850
growers their their chemical and their

1095
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:55,400
physical soil parameters all came back

1096
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:57,289
you know me the greens few yellows mixed

1097
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,269
in there so they were they were all fine

1098
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:01,610
it was when you went to the biological

1099
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,050
components that's when we got we saw red

1100
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,960
we saw them really low

1101
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:09,289
value scorp like scores so I think that

1102
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,539
a grower sees their chemical and their

1103
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:13,039
physical components on a regular basis

1104
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:15,500
when they take their swell test and they

1105
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,139
they see that initially can manage or

1106
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,420
soil for that fourth floor of those

1107
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:22,609
components but they never test the

1108
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,369
biological on it so they can't see how

1109
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:29,630
they're doing and to be honest I think

1110
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:33,409
that soil health is is something that is

1111
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:35,300
still somewhat new and maybe not within

1112
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,609
the science community but when you're

1113
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,460
trying to translate it from talking

1114
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,590
about it and developing its test to

1115
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,690
actually implementing that test as a

1116
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,470
grower in the field and so I think that

1117
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,300
there's going to be a lot of

1118
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:49,789
modifications that will have to be made

1119
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:53,450
to the soil tests that are available and

1120
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:54,769
I don't know the best the best

1121
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:56,989
indicators because selecting those

1122
00:48:54,769 --> 00:49:00,170
interviews just really critical but I

1123
00:48:56,989 --> 00:49:02,119
think there's a lot of a lot of

1124
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,490
developments being made especially in

1125
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,159
soil microbiology I think that hopefully

1126
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:10,349
those will trickle down and those kind

1127
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:13,289
of testing become less expensive and

1128
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:15,750
or indicative of how the soil violent

1129
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:17,639
the community kind of really is looking

1130
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,530
right now we're just doing is our

1131
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,690
lotteries are little that's really crew

1132
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,340
you'd be better if you can do what is

1133
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:26,190
there is an antagonistic as a

1134
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,630
protagonist stick so I think that those

1135
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:32,369
will get better with time but right now

1136
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:34,650
we need we need the data to be able to

1137
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:37,259
make that better so we want people to

1138
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,450
get on board but i think that when we

1139
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,460
look back in 50 years like all those

1140
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:51,659
tests weren't very good but we need to

1141
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:54,659
start somewhere Thanks this has been a
