1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,599
University okay without any further Ado

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm here to tell you a couple of things

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
uh first of all I'm I'm proud to stand

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,800
up here and say that what Lori and I are

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,800
about to do uh today continues to be a

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,039
good indication of how when uh conducted

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,519
properly Cooperative Extension in New

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,519
York state and the United States is

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,358
still alive and well and still a very

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,199
important part of the land grant mission

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,359
that I hope continues to uh maintain its

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,480
important as we as we head through uh

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,519
difficult budget time so that's my

15
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,558
political statement for the start of

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,359
this thing um my personal statement is

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,799
it's always wonderful to have colleagues

18
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,920
like Lori who are uh make for a

19
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,038
wonderful partnership where we know

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,559
there's a need we identify the way we

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,120
want to approach it we identify the

22
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,079
behaviors we want to change and we go

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,919
after it and do it in very classic

24
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,280
Cooperative Extension fashion so that's

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,159
the message for for

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,719
today you have to wonder what you all do

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
with yourselves coming out to listen to

28
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,759
a lawn talk on a day like this but we're

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,600
glad you're here nevertheless why do you

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,239
know Lawns why what is it doing here why

31
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,478
do I care about it I don't understand we

32
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,478
should completely get rid of these

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,438
things and the fact is uh Lawns both uh

34
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:24,000
cover a lot of grass a lot lot of grass

35
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:27,158
a lot of a lot of land um this is from

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,319
mesie of 2007 he did some spectral work

37
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,159
from a NASA satellite um and you see the

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:37,239
land cover it's um I think it's about

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,960
333 I'm not even sure exactly the land

40
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,798
coverage but you can see that it tends

41
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,000
to be focused around urban areas it has

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,479
enormous economic value it's an 85

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,799
billion dollar in Industry uh industry

44
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,959
nationally and Lawns make up 65% of that

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,840
economic value so Golf and sports and

46
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,759
sad all the other things uh account for

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,000
the other

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,759
35% uh nationally in New York state we

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,239
did a survey back in 2003 so that's uh

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
fairly dated now but at that time it was

51
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,280
a $5 billion industry and in New York

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,599
about 75% of the economic value came

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,120
from people buying stuff for their lawns

54
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:22,199
not hiring a service but buying things

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,319
uh for their lawns equipment uh

56
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,959
fertilizers pesticides seed uh Services

57
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,079
because we don't have a farm gate value

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,319
the uh Na s did the the stats they did

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,840
it for us in 2003 based on uh the way we

60
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,199
projected PE the amount of money people

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,120
spend on lawn so we have a lot of La so

62
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,759
why do we have Lawns why do we need

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,158
Lawns and and we need Lawns because we

64
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:51,519
do this to where we have Lawns when you

65
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:55,199
have a high percentage of impervious

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,920
surface you have enormous impacts on the

67
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,518
way water for example will move through

68
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,598
that system so it it then heightens the

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
importance of these vegetated green

70
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,000
spaces and I'm arguing a particular part

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,000
of it we can see from this slide is

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,878
Lawns and so how do we view the lawn as

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,519
something that helps us or at least

74
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,959
recognize as the people in the

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,239
Chesapeake Bay Area have recognized that

76
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,280
this is a significant land use that may

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
not serve a purpose out here to have it

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,199
doing the things we do with it uh in

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,040
urban areas in

80
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,560
Nebraska uh but in areas where we have a

81
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,199
lot of pavement it makes a lot of sense

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,959
to have something to medicate the

83
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,039
problems that the pavement cost very

84
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,438
good so so we know Lawns are everywhere

85
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,318
there's a lot of impervious surface we

86
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:50,199
also know that the climate is changing

87
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,919
dramatically right the climate is

88
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:56,199
changing anybody that works in growing

89
00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:00,119
something recognizes that this is some

90
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,959
data from 2011 from the from Noah and at

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,560
that time they were keeping weather

92
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,920
records for 117 years and two parts of

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,158
the United States had their warmest year

94
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,119
on record the march to August 2011

95
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:17,519
growing season and in the Northeast and

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,959
in the the South Central South Midwest

97
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,800
here um had the 108th and 109th so the

98
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,199
in the top 10% of the warmest years ever

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,319
so the climate is changing lots of Lawns

100
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,120
how do we get to love a good lawn why

101
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,879
would we embark on a project like this

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,439
well let me give you some background

103
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,519
that's my job is to sort of set the

104
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,918
stage for Lori to pick up on a little

105
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,240
bit about our program uh and what we

106
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,120
focused on a programmatic approach to

107
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,759
how we do things High touch Hightech

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
used to meet a lot 20 years ago when I

109
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,800
started an extension um doesn't mean as

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,759
much now but I want to show you we've

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,759
come through the ranks on thinking like

112
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,560
that in extension we've had some good

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,080
scholarship and of course measuring

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
impact we've been at this a long time in

115
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,079
Turf this is from the United States Golf

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,639
Association green section record from

117
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:11,000
July of 1921 when Cornell was commended

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,439
for starting a short course for parking

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,319
grounds

120
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:18,240
managers lebit toown the

121
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:21,839
original the original subdivision

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,199
Suburban love a good Lawn Place and so

123
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:29,000
as this happened in the 40s right at the

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,879
same time um not well not long after

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,120
about 20 20 years later we started to

126
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,478
realize the pressure on the Long Island

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,280
groundwaters uh the groundwater that

128
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,719
that the Long Island citizens use uh for

129
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,239
drinking water was under siege from

130
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Agriculture and at the same time we

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,560
looked at urban area so historically we

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,319
did the Cornell in cooperation with the

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,720
Water Resource Institute Dave Balden did

134
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,520
a bunch of surveys of Lawns on Long

135
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,080
Island in the

136
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,959
1970s looking for are Lawns leaky are

137
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,399
things leeching out into the groundwater

138
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,000
and what they found was that if you look

139
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,918
at the data as the lawn ages the organic

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,918
matter gets accumulating in there starts

141
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,159
to supply a fair amount of nitrogen

142
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:20,478
right right in the weeds we're getting

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,280
with in the 70s we figured out we knew

144
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,038
that this was happening now to be honest

145
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,478
we're slow learners but now these people

146
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,360
outside of the turf field just published

147
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,120
a paper this this past month on

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,560
household management practic an effect

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,240
on global warming of Home Urban

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,680
Lawns and what they concluded

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,199
was as the lawn ages you shouldn't

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,680
fertilize it as much because it

153
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,319
increases the global warming Problem by

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,800
putting out nitrogen fertilizer that

155
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,120
leaks into the atmosphere nitrogen is

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,879
300 times more potent as a greenhouse

157
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,399
gas than carbon so it's interesting to

158
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,639
see how things that started here at

159
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,638
Cornell are now still very currently a

160
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,319
part of the thinking about taking care

161
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,560
of Lawns so we've had a strong research

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,759
base for a long time very much focused

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,598
on Environmental Quality that has been

164
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,240
the emphasis of our program for a very

165
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,878
long time we also have a a focus with

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,840
our collaboration with the New York

167
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,599
State IPM program on a progressive Pest

168
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,399
Management approach that's both

169
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:24,918
ecologically based and uses IPM and

170
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,000
finally from an extension perspective

171
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,639
our work is always focused on enhanced

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,439
decision- making it's one thing to

173
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,918
create information

174
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,160
that that you just let loose at a

175
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,799
website or on a booklet it's another

176
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,360
thing when you take that information and

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
help people to make decisions to make

178
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,120
make their lives or the environment

179
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,878
better so here's our programmatic

180
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,918
approach that was the history and maybe

181
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,800
our focus our approach to this

182
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,478
particular project fits in like every

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,199
other thing that we do what's the issue

184
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,959
what's the audience let's get a resource

185
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,199
going let's work and work that resource

186
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,959
in various venues and now of course you

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,319
can add the augmented environments we do

188
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,680
webinars and Google chats and Skype and

189
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,560
everything else that we do we're

190
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,478
connected to Geneva so this uh is the

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,120
high touch and of course we're still

192
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,959
learning how to work in those augmented

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,280
environments for the high-tech part and

194
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,680
then we check out how we did you know we

195
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,478
put all this energy into doing all this

196
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,800
work did we change Behavior this is I

197
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,758
think a a thing a lot of extension

198
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,720
people don't always get that that just

199
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
putting the information out there isn't

200
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,959
isn't a role of extension there's a lot

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
of dopes that put information out all

202
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,958
over the place they don't help you make

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,479
decisions and that's a singular

204
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,199
science-based focus of uh Cooperative

205
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,399
Extension at least from my understanding

206
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,879
of it so an issue closer to Lawns as

207
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,080
environmental assets was when I got here

208
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,278
in 1996 we had just signed the New York

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,800
City Watershed agreement I sat on a

210
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,519
Governor's uh panel with particularly

211
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,799
protect ing the resources on the east of

212
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,679
Hudson Urban water the urban Watershed

213
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,359
that's the east of Hudson and primarily

214
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,639
uh phosphorus loading now we Marty

215
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,680
Petrovic and I did a bunch of work over

216
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,838
the years looking at leeching and runoff

217
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,199
of different compounds so we had to

218
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,600
research we put together that research

219
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,360
with colleagues in New England to sort

220
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,360
of get a better handle

221
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,000
on from a large perspective but here

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,639
from an extens perspective we developed

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,120
an

224
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:37,639
almanac we looked at lawn care and water

225
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,759
quality in a calendar format so it was

226
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,319
January you opened it you could look see

227
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,600
what should I be doing in January what

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,278
are the kinds of things if I want to

229
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,680
have a good lawn and protect water

230
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,320
quality what are the kinds of things you

231
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,078
can do so um we then did a bunch of

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,959
training for several years with this

233
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:58,199
Almanac um that's got to be 18 years old

234
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,039
now and when we went back and surveyed

235
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,320
how effective we were were from the the

236
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,039
money we got from the New York City

237
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,839
Watershed 40% of those we educated this

238
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:09,360
went out and soil tested for phosphorus

239
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,200
we said to them 90% of the Lawns east of

240
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
Hudson don't need supplementary

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,278
phosphorus if you test and you got this

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,879
number don't put it out there and so we

243
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:22,639
had enormous impact in the training that

244
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:24,200
we did and overall the four or 500

245
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,838
people that we trained particularly

246
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,160
through this process Master Gardeners

247
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,880
and otherwise all said we raised their

248
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:34,319
awareness they had no idea all the ways

249
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:37,159
taking care of their lawn could impact

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,240
water quality now this is translated

251
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,559
further in some of my professional uh

252
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,159
extension work the golf superintendent

253
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,838
and the golf industry came and gave us

254
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,559
$160,000 to develop a best management

255
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:53,800
practice set of principles that's online

256
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,559
um that was both uh reviewed by our

257
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,159
scientific colleagues for accuracy and

258
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,838
also by uh people in the division of

259
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,559
water and the division of pesticides for

260
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,519
the dec so they looked at what we wrote

261
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,479
here so it's U congruous with their

262
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,120
regulations and we're currently in a

263
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,560
phase two process we're now assessing

264
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,278
superintendent use and changing of

265
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:20,559
behavior for now that they have this

266
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,600
resource okay on our way to the ebook

267
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,078
which is to me the height of the the the

268
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,639
the star of the show here obviously

269
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,479
climate change is a big issue and I

270
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,560
mentioned it earlier it's one we think

271
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,399
about all the the time because this is

272
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,278
when people take care of their lawns or

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,679
their Gardens they can potentially have

274
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,919
an impact uh and their practices may

275
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,519
change we've done some research about

276
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,679
this um this was actually a a a class I

277
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,560
taught a bunch of undergrads and grad

278
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,239
students we got together and asked this

279
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,799
question this was one of the this was

280
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,240
the number one downloaded Turf article

281
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:59,000
from the turf information file from 19

282
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,600
uh from 2009 so we asked the question

283
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,240
how much carbon are we burning how much

284
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,040
are we sequestering got some good

285
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,680
preliminary data that many many have

286
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,159
published Beyond this we also published

287
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,039
a paper looking at how the changing

288
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,799
environment increases the conducive

289
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,759
environment for a folar pathogen in this

290
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,319
case dollar spot and I published it with

291
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,439
Rd Gano and we actually found looking at

292
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,600
weather records over a 50-year period

293
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,399
how pest pressure from the environment

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,720
has changed all these black dots are

295
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,519
where the environment is getting more

296
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,199
conducive to this particular folar

297
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,600
pathogen so we got some foundational

298
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:42,759
data I mean climate change is the issue

299
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,519
we see how it's impacting disease

300
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:48,919
pressure we published a research article

301
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,120
on it and we use that forecasting

302
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:54,039
information in our Weekly Newsletter

303
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,720
that we've uh written about our surveys

304
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,399
from in the Journal of

305
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,639
extension an example of just in time

306
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,759
education

307
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,440
and the forecasting and predicting of

308
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,958
these issues are part and partial to our

309
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,880
Weekly Newsletter and also well

310
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,198
integrated into our forecast website

311
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,198
that's managed through the Northeast

312
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,000
climate Center so again a commercial way

313
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:20,359
where we've identified how climate

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,320
change is altering uh pest pressure how

315
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,000
do we help the managers make better

316
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
decisions by regular contact with them

317
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,039
through the shortcut newsletter and

318
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,639
forecasting how their the risk for the

319
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,319
particular problems might be so they

320
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,480
might not use as many pesticides in

321
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,278
taking care of

322
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
it the Beth Page state park is another

323
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,720
example of some of the uh

324
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,319
decision-making work that we've done in

325
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
this case we started with the New York

326
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,000
State Park policy people who wanted a

327
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,359
ban pesticides across the entire State

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,039
Park system and we said maybe you should

329
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
treat golf courses differently so I

330
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,159
partnered up with uh Jennifer grant for

331
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,758
the New York State IPM program and

332
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,879
started working with uh the 27 State

333
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,000
golf courses throughout New York State

334
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,639
we've got a resource here developed by

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,159
Bob portes when he was a graduate

336
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,560
student and utilized in his time now as

337
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,639
an extension associate funded through

338
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,879
the uh New York state parks

339
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,600
department and we've taught national

340
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,399
seminars we are current you know we

341
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,040
started working at Beth Page now we work

342
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,759
at all 27 state parks um we've had

343
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,519
pretty good superintendent extension

344
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,320
update on from our website hits and our

345
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,399
extension colleagues continue to use

346
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,800
this in their training Pat vidto

347
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,120
uh uses it in her class at the

348
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,799
University of Massachusetts and those

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,440
that have done gone through our national

350
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:40,399
training said that 25 to 40% by using

351
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,120
tools developed through this we're able

352
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,320
to reduce their environmental impact at

353
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,519
their Pest Management program so again

354
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,120
how do we help people make decisions and

355
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,278
how do we determine how they're doing on

356
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,560
the other

357
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,720
end little gloating this is the book I

358
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,119
did a number of years ago this uh is the

359
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,680
top selling what as was the en raay now

360
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,039
was C now it's pal

361
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,239
um this book is still their number one

362
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,559
seller and again it's a tool devised for

363
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,120
helping people decide what to

364
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,719
do

365
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,879
okay just to remind you of the approach

366
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,600
that we

367
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:18,759
take and the introduction to Lor's uh

368
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
effort here our thinking based on all

369
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,320
that I've led to to this point is that

370
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
Lawns are a resource in an increasingly

371
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,040
urbanized environment so when you ask

372
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,239
people what a sustainable lawn is

373
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,838
they'll give you a variety of answers

374
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,198
right depending on what perspective they

375
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,959
come to you know what makes a lawn an

376
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:39,159
environmental asset or what makes a lawn

377
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:41,159
we can sustain so we sort of word Smith

378
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:44,240
uh different definitions but optimizes

379
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,799
the functional aspects of the lawn in

380
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
harmony with conserving natural

381
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,758
environment under economically F sound

382
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,839
and socially responsible you know all of

383
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,519
us adapt these things for whatever crop

384
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,680
we're working on but our emphasis has

385
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,440
been on the functional aspects of the

386
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,078
law not necess necessarily how it look

387
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,519
how it looks and that's why this isn't

388
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:11,838
love a great lawn it's love a good lawn

389
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,198
now why do this well the gallipo people

390
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,959
are are when you ask the degree to which

391
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,198
Americans worry about environmental

392
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,439
problems this is from 2008 or N I think

393
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,120
and you can see that how many worry

394
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,600
about these particular environmental

395
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,560
problems uh uh water pollution drinking

396
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,240
water pollution global warming

397
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,879
has about 50% not much at all think

398
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,399
about global warming now this is four

399
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,958
years ago so it may have changed a

400
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,679
little bit but the point I'm building to

401
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,719
is environmental actions in the US

402
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,679
they've there's been little increase in

403
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,079
general in environmental action most

404
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,318
people the biggest thing they do is

405
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:51,078
recycle across the board the biggest

406
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,838
thing they do is

407
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,679
recycle now the challenge we face in

408
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,040
getting people to look at Lawns as an

409
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,559
environmental asset is very much tied to

410
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,480
the econ economy again a Galla poll

411
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,038
taken all the way into

412
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,640
2011 which one of these statements about

413
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,558
the environment and the economy do you

414
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,439
most agree with protection of the

415
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,599
environment should be given priority

416
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,600
even at the risk of curving curving

417
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,318
economic growth or economic growth

418
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,759
should be given priority even if

419
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:26,480
environment suffers to some extent and

420
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,679
you can see the Gap from the 85 1985

421
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,759
when they first started asking these

422
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,679
questions in right around the turn of

423
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,919
the century you started to

424
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,559
see well I sort of think the

425
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,840
environment's important but you know I

426
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,359
got to have money right and so it was

427
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:43,359
you could see the downturn in the

428
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:46,279
economy right here we now a much bigger

429
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,439
concern for economic stability that

430
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,879
Environmental Quality and you can see

431
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,160
how these things are hovering right

432
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,840
around each other so to get people to

433
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,759
pay attention to environmental issues it

434
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,918
has to make economic sense it's actually

435
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,599
an easy set

436
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,280
once you tell people caring about the

437
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,918
environment inherently could mean you're

438
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,038
going to spend less it tends to balance

439
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,520
those things for people now this was a

440
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,798
tough go even internally the American

441
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,759
Society of Landscape Architects in

442
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,639
cooperation with ladyb Bird Johnson and

443
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,879
the US botanic garden said we want this

444
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,600
sustainable initi sustainable sites

445
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,960
initiative which is essentially lead you

446
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,399
know the building standards for lawns

447
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,079
I'm sorry for for the outside for the

448
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,120
landscape lead for the

449
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,480
landscape and in in right out of the

450
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,639
gate they basically said well you can't

451
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,200
have a sustainable site if you have any

452
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
grass because there were no

453
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,960
recommendations for having grass in this

454
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,798
initiative so we uh put a class together

455
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
and did some work but what I can tell

456
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:53,599
you is we're up against quite a battle

457
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,839
both you know this

458
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,480
issue our own peers don't seem to

459
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,519
understand the role that these these

460
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,159
things play and we all know how this

461
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,480
governs a lot of the Landscapes that we

462
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,200
manage but in the end in difficult

463
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,440
Economic Times people tend to reduce

464
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,759
their commitment to Environmental

465
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,919
Quality and I think this is what makes

466
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,000
the cell we're doing with this U new

467
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,679
project even tougher so you have to make

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,038
Environmental Quality make economic

469
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,919
sense and that's exactly the approach we

470
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,599
took with this book so what does this

471
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,679
mean for lawn care well my career has

472
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,599
led me to this point where I believe

473
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
we've got to anticipate the effect that

474
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,199
climate change is is going to have on

475
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,119
managing the things that we're doing

476
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,000
we've got to position the lawn as a

477
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,759
resource it can't just be a beauty

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,038
contest it can't be I got to have a good

479
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,480
lawn because the Joneses down the block

480
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,158
have the good lawn and I want to have

481
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,400
the best lawn and we know from current

482
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,600
uh economic and sort of environmental

483
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,280
awareness surveys a lot of people still

484
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,798
feel like they got to have a good lawn

485
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,599
to keep up with their neighbors that's

486
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,839
not gone away and we must adopt a

487
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,719
progressive approach that balances cost

488
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:02,519
look and function and that is where we

489
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,360
get this wonderful resource now that

490
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,000
capitalizes on a lot of the things that

491
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,319
I've talked about in the past but now

492
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,240
really utilizes that that technology in

493
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,839
a a really meaningful way and you know

494
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,359
not like it's any great deal people make

495
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,119
iBooks but for us this is Leading Edge

496
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,359
in some of the Cooperative Extension

497
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,279
stuff that we see so without any further

498
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,879
Ado I'm going to transfer just two

499
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:28,720
minutes past sorry uh to my colleague

500
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,799
Lori spend a few more minutes on a few

501
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,720
more slides and then I'm going to show

502
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:37,679
you um sections of the of the iBook so

503
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
as as Frank um alluded to several

504
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,759
reasons why it was a top priority to to

505
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,279
think about lawn care for him and for me

506
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,240
equally um I was thinking about why

507
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,079
should I care about long care and with

508
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,319
our garden based learning program

509
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,359
certainly thinking about um how people

510
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,119
are environmental stewards is a top

511
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,879
priority so so that was an easy sell for

512
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,038
for me the the several other reasons are

513
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,640
that there are 2.8 million Acres of Home

514
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:09,440
lawns in New York state alone so what

515
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,840
people do with their lawns really makes

516
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,558
it matters so that was another

517
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,079
compelling region and also in Cornell

518
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,319
Cooperative Extension around the state

519
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,278
we have County offices and our County

520
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,798
offices uh report um they get phone

521
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:27,558
calls from the the public and they

522
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:31,480
report that 50% of their calls related

523
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:34,038
to uh gardening and Lawn Care 50% of

524
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,120
them are lawn care and so in some

525
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,319
counties that's 800 calls a year people

526
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,278
calling up and asking about what to some

527
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,439
some practice that relates to La care so

528
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:48,480
another compelling reason for me to be

529
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
involved and to for me to get the people

530
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,200
I work with the horiculture Educators

531
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,519
and the master Garder volunteers

532
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,360
involved and then um certainly Frank

533
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,400
relayed lots of research and new um

534
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,759
information that's coming out about

535
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,159
lawns and how Lawns are an environmental

536
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,558
asset as well as some new regulations he

537
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,919
didn't touch on some of the new

538
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,158
regulations but there's some new

539
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,278
regulations out there as well so another

540
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,360
reason why we want those Cooperative

541
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:16,000
Extension Educators and Master Gardener

542
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,158
volunteers to be aware of the best

543
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,400
management practices that are based on

544
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,600
research-based

545
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,840
information and then also Frank was

546
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,079
willing to to partner with me so

547
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,639
certainly I could pick other topics but

548
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,439
if I don't have a research um faculty

549
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,799
member who can help me develop that

550
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,919
resource with their expertise it's hard

551
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,879
to go forward so that's that's critical

552
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,440
the another critical thing that led us

553
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,278
in the direction of trying out an iBook

554
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,000
was that we did get funding from New

555
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:50,000
York State IPM to to help offset the

556
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,839
cost of developing this book so critical

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,159
reasons and so why did we decide that we

558
00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:00,839
would

559
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:03,559
um try to create an i book and um we

560
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,000
wanted to main be maintain our current

561
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:08,200
be current and connected to where people

562
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,519
are getting information and this report

563
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,880
is actually from 2012 so I think it's

564
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,759
probably even more um the numbers are

565
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,799
higher now but a Pew Research Center

566
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:22,919
revealed that 43% 43% of Americans age

567
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:25,319
16 or older have read an ebook um as as

568
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,759
a source of pleasure or gathering

569
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:32,079
information so so people are

570
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:34,519
using ebooks and so maybe extension

571
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,519
could be

572
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,640
there those of you are laughing I know

573
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,960
why um and

574
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,919
um so uh so again Frank already showed

575
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,278
you this and the handout will connect

576
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,679
you to um to um iTunes so I did the

577
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,519
ebook in iTunes and there are many

578
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
logistical reasons why I did that the

579
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,000
main being my my knowledge of

580
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,319
programming is limited in iTunes iBook

581
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,919
author makes it somewhat accessible for

582
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,558
somebody with my knowledge to do it

583
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
there I will not tell you it was easy

584
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,440
but I couldn't do it uh in a different

585
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,960
format but they made it slightly easy so

586
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:21,720
in order to get to the iBook which can

587
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:26,319
only be viewed on a a Mac a smartphone

588
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:29,159
or I uh or a a Mac laptop that has iBook

589
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,839
on it so it has some l that way or an

590
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:35,120
iPad um but if you go into iTunes and

591
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:39,480
you search under long care you get like

592
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,798
this many books and um none of them are

593
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,558
based on backed with research-based

594
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,558
information and I'll tell you how

595
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,319
exciting some of them are um how much

596
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,200
time do you want to spend on lawns this

597
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,439
book on organic lawn care work it's only

598
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,440
250 pages long and then this one 100

599
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,919
lawn care tips um number five says think

600
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,440
about your lawn just before going going

601
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,360
to bed I'm pretty sure most of the

602
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,640
people we're trying to reach who are

603
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,678
taking care of their lawns are not going

604
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,038
to spend the time to shift through some

605
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,038
of these so really Our intention with

606
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:15,679
our our um iBook ebook is to make it

607
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,599
much more accessible to those who want

608
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,480
to spend a limited amount of time um

609
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,398
carrying thinking about their lawn so

610
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,960
really the average lawn person to really

611
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,918
maximize the number of people who will

612
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,720
actually look at the information and do

613
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,278
the right thing change their

614
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,360
behaviors so yeah you'll see that those

615
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,319
books essentially are PDFs they're PDFs

616
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:42,079
we can put PDFs up we actually an

617
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:44,558
extension know how to do that and um so

618
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:48,038
Craig can edit

619
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,798
um so but this iBook um I'll show you

620
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:53,759
some clips from it and the intention was

621
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:57,278
to keep the text limited and um you can

622
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,879
see it's actually only 45 pages long and

623
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,319
and if no one read be Beyond page 12

624
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,159
most people would be doing the right and

625
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,000
did what was in the first 12 Pages

626
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,960
they'd be doing the right thing so

627
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,519
beyond those first 12 pages are just

628
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,000
like bonuses for the people who are

629
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,679
geeking out about their lawns and um and

630
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,558
we do have a section where we ask people

631
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,798
to that actually go to a qual trek

632
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,240
survey and they can give us feedback on

633
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,918
what they they get behaviors they might

634
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,558
have changed by reading the book so we

635
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,720
have that sort of built into the book a

636
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,720
little opportunity for feedback so so

637
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,278
this is sort of the layout of the book

638
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,240
and now

639
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,919
um I'm going to escape this and go try

640
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,919
to quickly go to um iBooks

641
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,240
here so if you download it you then open

642
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,240
up

643
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,278
iBook and it will actually come out

644
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:55,519
um it'll look a little different when

645
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,599
you first open it this was just the last

646
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,000
page I'm actually going to do it

647
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,038
slightly different so so you see what

648
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
happens when you open it

649
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,759
um so when you open it

650
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,440
up you get the really the last page that

651
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:14,599
you looked

652
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:19,240
at and then let me see if I

653
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,240
can I might have to keep it down for a

654
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,719
second I just wanted to show you the

655
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,079
table of contents and I'm going to go to

656
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,399
the thumbnails and and then I'm going to

657
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,599
go big

658
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,599
screen so um these this thumbnail is

659
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,319
just just shows you quickly what's in

660
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,639
the

661
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:42,359
book rough rough thing in the book and

662
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,519
um and it this is the first section here

663
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,839
four steps to success these are the

664
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,000
first actually only 10 pages because

665
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,759
there's two intro pages and um and so

666
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,558
I'm going to actually show you first the

667
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:58,240
intro movie the simple steps that we

668
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,359
were trying to get across to to uh

669
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,079
introduce people to really the most

670
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:04,519
important things they need need to do to

671
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,558
care for their lawn and so we have a

672
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,679
number of these videos all of them are

673
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,000
less than uh most of them are about a

674
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,440
minute long some are U the longest one

675
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,159
is three minutes but most of them are

676
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,159
quick and the whole

677
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,080
um the whole book really aims at being

678
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,039
uh an easy short read and friendly um

679
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:30,960
words not trying not to use any language

680
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,960
that that you know a typical um maybe

681
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,798
even eighth grader wouldn't wouldn't

682
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,440
already have that vocabulary so back to

683
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:39,440
the four steps this is these are the

684
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,320
four steps in which if they just did

685
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,200
these few things it would be terribly

686
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:46,558
exciting um and we would have a great

687
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,640
impact on on how Lawns are an

688
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,200
environmental asset and they're Lawn

689
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,000
Care people are environmental

690
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,720
stewards so um I'm going to skip right

691
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,759
to make

692
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,960
adjustments so you can jump around

693
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,679
easily in in the book and down here you

694
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,798
can even flip back to whatever page you

695
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,600
previously were on and again uh make

696
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:08,079
adjustments we list uh keep the mower

697
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,639
blade sharp mow grass higher mols grass

698
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,398
clippings mow tree leaves in the fall

699
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,519
patch weaker bare spots and I'm going to

700
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,199
skip to the mow grass higher and I'm

701
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:21,359
going to see if I can I can um actually

702
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,120
I'm going to flip back I'm going to go

703
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,599
to sharpen your mower blade so with all

704
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:30,479
the videos as with the words in the book

705
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,759
most all the were saying do this um as

706
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
opposed to well you could do this or you

707
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,359
could do this um or this uh we

708
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:41,038
essentially went to these are not

709
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,798
necessarily Avid um gardeners who want

710
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,480
to know all this information and who

711
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,000
delve into and wants to make decisions

712
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,519
these are people who are like I have

713
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,839
this house I have this lawn what the

714
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,919
heck am I supposed to do and we're

715
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,000
saying just do this do this do this and

716
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,840
and just trying to uh address that

717
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,798
audience who who don't want all a whole

718
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,599
bunch of options this no no no what can

719
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,319
I do to do the right thing and so all of

720
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,278
the the videos really focus on on just

721
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,480
do it this

722
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:11,839
way right and and so as Frank mentioned

723
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,599
all of these videos were were were

724
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,599
filmed and and uh edited by

725
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,759
professionals so we didn't we didn't

726
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,439
make

727
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,119
these we might have um structured how

728
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,919
they would U come out but we didn't make

729
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,678
them so again I'm sort of going to flip

730
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,240
through the first 10 pages uh do less

731
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,240
skip

732
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,360
feeding that oh and I should also say

733
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,599
all of our images um so all of our

734
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,599
images we had to because it was it was

735
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,278
out there in I iTunes uh all of our

736
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,639
images had to have been um our images

737
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:49,440
but I also must tell you I found great

738
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,600
images on Flickr and if you go to those

739
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,759
that um allow you to use them with

740
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,599
recognition um got great images onl and

741
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,558
flicker I know everybody's looking for

742
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,398
those um and then uh so this is really

743
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:05,599
page 11 and I would this is also a very

744
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,558
short short video uh but this was that

745
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,839
was the sort of bulk of the content that

746
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,200
we that we want people to focus on and

747
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,519
you can always go back up to either the

748
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,840
thumbnails or the table of contents and

749
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,638
flip through the book some more I'll

750
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,678
just show you Advanced Care just to

751
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:26,199
highlight um what we have in Advanced

752
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,320
Care and Feeding which is what lots of

753
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,200
people think of fertiliz in as feeding

754
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:36,000
uh we consider that in the Advanced Care

755
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,240
um section it's not really part of that

756
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,079
F those first 11 pages that really

757
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,880
mostly you want people to use a sharp

758
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,798
mower blade and um if they everyone did

759
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,039
that um the fuel consumption that would

760
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:52,638
be saved um would be great and I will

761
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:55,119
show you again um even information about

762
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,959
insect pests and weeds is in the

763
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,158
advanced care I'm going to see if it'll

764
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,200
go to the insect section for

765
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,240
us

766
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,440
maybe oh just a little sluggish so in

767
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,079
the insect section we actually

768
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,480
throughout the book I have um a number

769
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,678
of galleries photo galleries which you

770
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,519
can embed in the book and so you can add

771
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,519
content that

772
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:27,799
way as well

773
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:30,879
as this interactive image and um

774
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:32,839
get will can flick on it and get some

775
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,399
additional

776
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:39,879
information and again you

777
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,719
can very easy to flip through the book

778
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,600
this

779
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,759
way people can quickly find something

780
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:50,439
that oh I wanted to know about

781
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:52,759
that and it and as I said all the way

782
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,759
back I have a place where you can share

783
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,278
feedback and that's where I want to

784
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,000
mention um that uh we haven't really

785
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,000
launched this book because we finished

786
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,159
it up and the lawn care season is a

787
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,638
little under the under the weather right

788
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,840
now so people aren't really thinking

789
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:09,879
about lawns but we plan to launch it

790
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,879
this spring and we've done a sort of a a

791
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,360
soft launch but we will fully launch it

792
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,039
and hopefully get some good um press and

793
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:21,240
some sending it out to uh those people

794
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:23,440
we want to to take a look at it and get

795
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,399
some feedback but even though we haven't

796
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,798
really sent it out to a wide selection

797
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,678
of people I have actually had people

798
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:32,398
click on the yes that this book was

799
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,120
helpful and and the exciting thing was

800
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,119
that the things that they say they were

801
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,879
going to change so that goes to two

802
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,359
questions and it asks if you're going to

803
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,559
change any behavior and three responses

804
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,879
I got was I'm going to change how I um

805
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,000
fertilize I'm going to remove the high

806
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,960
spots in my lawn so I don't scalp my

807
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,519
lawn and then um I'm going to stay on

808
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,159
keeping my mower blade sharp so already

809
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,079
the indications from those few people

810
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,679
are like okay they're getting it they're

811
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,038
getting the message because maybe we're

812
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,840
keeping it simple enough we're not

813
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,119
giving them too much information very

814
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,119
few people would sit through Frank's 20

815
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,638
brief minutes about long care and you

816
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:11,000
guys are very polite

817
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:13,078
and and so so we really Tred to sort of

818
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,358
entertain them as well as try to to

819
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,399
deliver that information and as far as

820
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:23,480
as next steps

821
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:26,918
go um I'm this is kind of the the

822
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,960
Bible for lawn care in our cooperative

823
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,358
exension

824
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,878
system I just wanted to go back to

825
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,519
acknowledgements and um and so uh I but

826
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,118
I have the opportunity to take this and

827
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,199
make easy updates you might see that

828
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,599
it's already version 1.1 because I

829
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,439
already found things that I needed to

830
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,599
update so it's easy enough for Frank to

831
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,639
feed me information and then I can make

832
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,000
updates in in the text and those people

833
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,599
who already downloaded the the book can

834
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,398
then um Can will get noticed that that

835
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,599
it's been updated so so that's that's

836
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:00,078
pretty pretty easy to do and what we can

837
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,838
also do is we have about seven videos in

838
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,839
there if we get get additional resources

839
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,599
we can change some of the the text to

840
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,759
add more videos that we didn't just

841
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,119
didn't have the resources to produce uh

842
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,440
any more than seven so um one of those

843
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,160
might be related to the the under what

844
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,400
circumstances should you be mulching

845
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,960
leaves or what conditions because there

846
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,200
are some municipalities who who thought

847
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,960
that leaf mulching requiring everyone to

848
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:27,358
mulch their leaves would be wonderful

849
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,880
way to save money

850
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,440
but there are circumstances under which

851
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,559
um they won't mulch well and people

852
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,480
won't like it so that one thing that

853
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,838
we're looking forward to in the future

854
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,000
as well as using this as the core the

855
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:44,279
core uh portion of the Master Gardener

856
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,920
volunteer training about long carees so

857
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,359
with that we have about five more

858
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,358
minutes maybe take some questions or

859
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:59,358
comments this has been a production of
