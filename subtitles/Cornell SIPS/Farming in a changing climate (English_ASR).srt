1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,278
University have you seen any local

3
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,198
effects of extreme weather and and

4
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,759
climate change in in the years

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,039
especially that especially because you

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,199
you're native here to Duchess County uh

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,480
yes I have it seems like the uh

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,359
winterers are getting much milder uh

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,079
we're getting more I think think more

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,879
severe weather as we head south seems to

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,359
be getting more snow more cold uh

12
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:42,439
Winters are not nearly as bad

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,840
uh we've had three major weather events

14
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:47,159
in the last couple years one two years

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,920
ago the excessive snow throughout the

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,519
winter uh last fall with the uh you know

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,520
being hit by tremendous amounts of rain

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,719
the hurricane and then this winter with

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,359
I don't ever recall a winter of this

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,719
uh as easy as it was I've gone through

21
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,560
snowless Winters but never with as mild

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,359
as it's been we didn't have a winter

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,960
actually and we didn't have a winter and

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,959
I see uh a lot less hay was fed a lot

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,519
less hay was used

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,399
uh which is you know a double-edged

27
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,039
sword it's good for those that didn't

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,439
have to buy high but it's poor for those

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,439
of us that sell high or it's it's an

30
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:35,519
issue uh what the insect population or

31
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,158
and

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,920
the bad bugs that weren't killed uh in

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,359
today's paper there was a major thing

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,079
about uh you know lime disease being you

35
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:53,118
know perhaps the banner year for Lyme

36
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,319
disease so I'm I'm really concerned over

37
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,680
what's coming down the road even though

38
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,398
I

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,759
can't predict I can only hope things

40
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,079
won't be as dire as they may be what

41
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,799
happened to your farm during the extreme

42
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,159
weather events and how much money you

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:15,519
think you lost how did it affect

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,239
you uh of course it started in in April

45
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,800
last year with the fact that we had so

46
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,680
much trouble getting the crops in uh

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
just you know we got them seated and we

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,560
couldn't go even go back and roll them

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,920
roll them pick up Rock uh which in turn

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,400
we probably got a poorer catch of seed

51
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,799
than we should have so that that

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,560
bothered us you know just little little

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
things that you know don't always add up

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,360
the fact that you have to

55
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,238
send people again and again back to the

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,720
field because there's big wet spot you

57
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,759
had to go around and stuff like that it

58
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,800
takes a lot more time we lost probably

59
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,639
half our oat crop because we couldn't

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,640
get it we couldn't Harvest it in the

61
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,238
window that we had it went down we lost

62
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:04,439
a lot of it uh

63
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:08,080
uh the biggest thing that's bothering me

64
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,158
right today is that we left probably

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,959
$115,000 worth of

66
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:16,479
hay uh second cutting grass hay in the

67
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,360
field that we could not Harvest last

68
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:23,679
fall we made many attempts we got some

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,959
in but we do a lot of hay so we we left

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
$15,000 worth a hay in the field which

71
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:34,360
is really financially bothering me right

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:38,280
now strap me uh we lost a field of corn

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,680
uh uh that was you know a lot of it was

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,039
management fault for not chopping that

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,760
field we left it for grain thought we

76
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,039
could get it and we got the late

77
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,679
snowstorm and it was very tall corn and

78
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:54,759
it took it down so we lost we lost a lot

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,560
of corn over there so we probably lost a

80
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:01,639
minimum of 40,000 or so in crops you can

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,598
as a farmer you can

82
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,518
you can weather the

83
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,598
storm but you can't weather continuous

84
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,000
storms uh you can you can take it on the

85
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,280
chin you can uh you know you you come

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,798
back spring brings Eternal hope and

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,000
that's as a farmer that's what's that's

88
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:25,039
what fuels me that's what you know as I

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,879
as I become alive I mean this winter you

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
know as the warm weather comes you we

91
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,120
all feel like doing more and as the

92
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,400
farmer it's it's just so much easier you

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,439
know we we think again this year I have

94
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,359
this probably skewed Vision that this is

95
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,360
going to be the best year

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,680
ever this has been a production of
