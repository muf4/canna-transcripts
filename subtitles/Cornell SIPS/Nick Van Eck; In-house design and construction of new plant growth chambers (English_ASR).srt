1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:07,690
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:10,039
University as Joyce mentioned I'm the

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,798
growth chamber supervisor for the

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:17,419
Cornell AG Experiment Station and I've

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:19,608
had that job for nine years and while I

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,010
worked for the Tanksley lab for almost

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,949
20 years I attended a lot of seminars in

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:30,019
this room and never really expected to

9
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:32,469
be giving one Here I am I actually have

10
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:36,320
something you might be interested in and

11
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:39,439
I'm very happy to tell you about the two

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,509
growth chambers that my crew designed

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:47,209
and built and I also want to talk about

14
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:50,119
why we think that these chambers should

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,910
be the ones that Cornell adopts as we

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:56,328
try to move away from the old chambers

17
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:58,968
that we're using now so understand what

18
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:04,010
we have now let's take a quick look back

19
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:06,489
at how we got here let me put on oh yeah

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,490
here we go

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:15,110
there's the prototype we've had growth

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,400
chambers at Cornell since 1964 for more

23
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:19,090
than 40 years

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,890
each department had their own chambers

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,380
that they controlled and that's how it

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,069
was not just four chambers but also four

27
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:30,079
farms and greenhouses each department

28
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,059
had their own chambers their own

29
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,390
specific greenhouses with their own

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:41,990
watering staff their own farms each with

31
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:44,689
a farm manager and staff and tractors by

32
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:45,799
2010 farms greenhouses and growth

33
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,829
chambers were taken away from

34
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,310
departmental control and given to the AG

35
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,909
Experiment Station to manage with the

36
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:58,460
idea that there would be more improved

37
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,789
efficiency and we reduced the

38
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,429
duplication of equipment and personnel

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,290
if you remember back then

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,550
Cornell like the rest of the country was

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,330
trying to recover from the economic

42
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:14,270
recession of 2008 and so they were

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,690
looking for ways to save money and so

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,730
now

45
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:19,389
these facilities could be under one

46
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:21,829
managerial umbrella so to speak and

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:25,399
growth chambers could be looked at as

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,920
one single group and decisions could be

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,409
made about which chambers we might be

50
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:36,619
able to discard because a lot of them

51
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:39,050
were not only very old but also they

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,700
were very expensive to operate and a lot

53
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,240
of them weren't even used all that often

54
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:48,079
so we did discard about 34 chambers in

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,110
the first few years but at about the

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
same time we were also in having 33

57
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,970
chambers installed at Weill Hall so we

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,910
were pretty sure we weren't gonna short

59
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:02,900
ourselves a growth chamber space by

60
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:05,629
throwing away those old ones also for

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,210
some of the old chambers that were still

62
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,030
in big demand we got a chance to

63
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:16,040
retrofit them by replacing some of the

64
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:19,280
less efficient parts 22 old walk-in

65
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:23,299
chambers that are out at the Kent post

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,610
lab that area got new lighting and

67
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,370
computer controls thanks to a grant from

68
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,680
NYSERDA which is the New York State

69
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,239
energy resource &amp; Development Authority

70
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,590
and that retrofit worked out really well

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,310
the Chamber's got twice the light

72
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,620
intensity at half the operating cost my

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,030
Sirte was so happy that they immediately

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,890
came back with another grant and we got

75
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,180
a chance to put new lighting in a lot of

76
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,179
our region chambers

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,750
still

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,300
third grant was forthcoming right after

79
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,610
that and they told us that they would

80
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,520
buy us six new chambers if we would

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,730
agree to throw away ten of our least

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,969
efficient ones and the chamber crew had

83
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:13,579
already done energy analysis on most of

84
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:16,040
our chamber models by then so we knew

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,870
exactly which chambers were the least

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,989
efficient and we were all too happy to

87
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,180
throw them away and today those six

88
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:28,310
chambers that NYSERDA bought us are in

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,590
operation at Weill Hall so let's take a

90
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,439
look at some of the hundred and twenty

91
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:40,969
five chambers that we currently are

92
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:43,310
using the 1960s brought us the first

93
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,800
thirty-five chambers in a collaboration

94
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,050
with dr. Arthur Watson Dimmick of the

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,879
plant pathology department and the

96
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,509
environmental growth chambers company or

97
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:57,019
EGC and these chambers are still in use

98
00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:02,209
today down at the Ken post lab or new

99
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:03,918
and secretary endemic lab also the

100
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,199
growth chamber crew was established at

101
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,699
this time to maintain these chambers and

102
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:12,529
they were based out of the plant

103
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:17,479
pathology department that a lot of slide

104
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:18,918
change is coming up here in the 70s all

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,100
the other departments wanted their

106
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,199
chambers to so agronomy which crop and

107
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,180
soils was known back then and plant

108
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,829
breeding plant biology and horticulture

109
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,259
they invested in about 40 chambers

110
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,620
they were mostly reach-in chambers from

111
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:38,418
the shear corporation a large space had

112
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,090
already been designed and built into

113
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,990
that nugu Terman lab that was built out

114
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:46,639
on the edge of campus back then and

115
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,400
about half the chambers went to goo

116
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,099
termen others went to Bradfield and

117
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,379
plant science and some may have even

118
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,379
found their way into individual labs

119
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:03,649
the chamber crew which whoops that's

120
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,810
went too fast there the chamber crew

121
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,579
which was still under Plant Pathology

122
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,639
was asked to maintain all of these new

123
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:15,560
chambers as well and at that time we

124
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,599
started charging fees to raise money to

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,569
buy spare parts for the chambers this is

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,700
a slide of the Bradfield chamber room in

127
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,889
one of its better years if you've seen

128
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:30,420
it recently it doesn't really look that

129
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:32,579
good anymore so over the next few

130
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,180
decades additional chambers were sort of

131
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,649
added to the fleet here and there may be

132
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,470
a professor would write an equipment

133
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,409
grant or brought chambers with them when

134
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,720
they came here from another university

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,540
then in 2000 or there abouts Emerson

136
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,300
hall was renovated to include a large

137
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,830
chamber room in the basement where 23

138
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,259
conveyor and growth chambers were

139
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,060
installed and they would serve the

140
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,759
research projects in the Bradfield

141
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,449
Emerson in plant science area

142
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,490
these were state-of-the-art chambers

143
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:09,990
they had a central computer and digital

144
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:15,720
controls and humidity which was new for

145
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:18,389
chambers back then at this point all of

146
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,280
the chambers that Cornell now had were

147
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,709
the traditional kind of chambers in the

148
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,229
sense that temperature control was

149
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,479
achieved through compressors and

150
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,629
refrigeration for cooling and electric

151
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,100
heaters for heating that's the

152
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:38,420
traditional style and it still is the

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,420
traditional style in most places in

154
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:44,179
tooth

155
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,770
in nine while Hall was built a large

156
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,170
room was set aside in the basement to

157
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:51,139
house growth chambers and today there

158
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:55,550
are 34 chambers at while used by faculty

159
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:58,219
and grad students and these chambers are

160
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,790
pretty unique they're unique because

161
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,800
they don't use compressors or electric

162
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,710
heaters to regulate temperature like all

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,350
the other growth chambers this building

164
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:12,729
was designed so that campus chilled

165
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:16,280
water and building reheat water

166
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,379
circulating in pipes overhead would be

167
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,839
used to regulate the temperature inside

168
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:25,909
the chamber valves would send hot water

169
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,399
and cold water into separate coils

170
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,980
inside the walls of the chamber and fans

171
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,340
would circulate air past those coils now

172
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,469
here's a we took the panel off of one of

173
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,320
the wild chambers to reveal what's

174
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,090
inside obviously the fans and here are

175
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,840
the two coils that are inside the wall

176
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:53,570
and this system repeats itself on the on

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:55,100
the opposite wall this method is much

178
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,470
more energy efficient than the

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,110
traditional way of regulating the

180
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,870
temperature in a chamber the wild

181
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,690
building architects Cornell project

182
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,389
managers and Doug Keefe from the AC in

183
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,480
our shop got together with the Percival

184
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:14,090
scientific engineers to design this

185
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,490
system and it works really well the

186
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,170
temperature is usually maintained to

187
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,590
within a few tenths of a degree of the

188
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:24,500
set point and the people who got

189
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,509
together to design this really knew how

190
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,360
much energy was going to be required by

191
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,850
this many chambers so they designed a

192
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:38,720
system that really reduced the amount of

193
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:41,450
energy but even though the it works

194
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,360
pretty well at saving energy there are

195
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,160
some other problems with these chambers

196
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,129
the most damaging problem is that the

197
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,549
the water system is located on the roof

198
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:56,189
of all those chambers

199
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:58,169
the plastic plumbing fittings that are

200
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,890
part of the hot water supply and return

201
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:04,679
system are located on the top and these

202
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,059
plastic fittings are rated for a

203
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,809
temperature of a hundred and forty

204
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:12,059
degrees but somebody must have forgot to

205
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,588
ask the wild people what the temperature

206
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,338
of their water was because it's at a

207
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:24,890
hundred and eighty degrees that led to a

208
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:27,209
few problems after the first year or two

209
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:30,149
he started getting cracks in those

210
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,699
fittings and water would leak out and

211
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,799
eventually find its way over the side

212
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,470
walls of the chamber or work its way

213
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,629
into the Lightcap where all the wiring

214
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:45,170
was for the lights and the ballasts and

215
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,169
that mix did not go well let me tell you

216
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,709
water would eventually drip through the

217
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,470
light barrier and it would appear to be

218
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:56,278
raining inside the chamber this happened

219
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,589
you know quite a few times or water

220
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,870
might flow right through down the top of

221
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:05,180
that control cabinet and short out the

222
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:09,299
electrical components on its way down so

223
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:11,159
once at 3 o'clock in the morning one of

224
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,049
those plastic fittings broke completely

225
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,078
in half and it sent a geyser of hot

226
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:18,899
water up to the roof of the the ceiling

227
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,208
of the room where that water fanned out

228
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,480
and it rained down and all the adjacent

229
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:27,179
chambers we had to find a valve way

230
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,950
upstream to kill the flow because we

231
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,419
couldn't get anywhere near there the

232
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,379
water is a hundred and eighty degrees

233
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:38,729
and you don't want any of that so we

234
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,519
eventually shut the water off and about

235
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,320
five or six years ago I was up on the

236
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,539
roof of one of those chambers sponging

237
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,540
up the water after another fitting break

238
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:51,539
and my boss heard what had happened

239
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:54,509
again and so he came down to check it

240
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:56,309
out and while I was up there when I saw

241
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:58,649
him come in the room I yelled down at

242
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:02,739
him hey we could do better than this at

243
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:07,120
half the price I'll be

244
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,980
see I was frustrated again but I really

245
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,379
didn't expect anything to come from it

246
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,720
but it wasn't long after that I started

247
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,159
getting questions like you know what

248
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,940
exactly would you do to make it better

249
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:23,708
and having listened to what the crew was

250
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,070
telling me about fixing these problems

251
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,659
and listening to them after they fixed a

252
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,750
lot of the other chamber problems that

253
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:33,789
we would have I knew that they knew

254
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,370
exactly what it would take to make a

255
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:39,309
better chamber you know which which

256
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:43,299
components last longer which ones are

257
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:46,479
more reliable they had been dealing with

258
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:48,909
chamber failures for years so who better

259
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,528
to come up with a lasting solution than

260
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:56,250
the people who are having to deal with

261
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:58,838
this every day so we had a few meetings

262
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,789
which eventually led to a meeting with

263
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,820
the director of the Cornell experiment

264
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,829
station the crew described how they

265
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,990
would make a very efficient and durable

266
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,879
growth chamber and at the end of the

267
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,879
meeting we were asked to provide an

268
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:15,669
estimate as to how much it would take

269
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:19,889
how much it would cost to build a small

270
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:22,360
prototype to sort of prove the concept

271
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:27,730
after we found a source for a nice

272
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,440
insulated box and found prices for the

273
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,680
best components that money could buy

274
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,130
because I don't want cheap components

275
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,289
that'll just going to fail we figured

276
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,889
that it would take about twenty thousand

277
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:43,208
dollars to purchase all the parts and

278
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:45,970
now bear in mind that a commercially

279
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:48,489
available chamber of this size will

280
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,200
probably cost some between 75 and 80

281
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,669
thousand dollars by the time it's

282
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,230
delivered and installed so once we got

283
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:59,769
an account number we started ordering

284
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,829
all the parts it took months to get

285
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,569
everything the insulated white box took

286
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:07,179
over six months because we tried to

287
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,610
order it during their busy season and we

288
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:13,419
also needed them to make some custom

289
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,669
modifications the door is normally

290
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,399
located in the center of this

291
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:20,769
side of the box and we needed them to

292
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,159
move it to the right and down so that we

293
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:26,620
had room to put the control cab and so

294
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,850
we had to wait for their slack time so

295
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:33,789
they could retool their production line

296
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,320
you've you've seen these boxes often you

297
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,779
go to the supermarket there's plenty of

298
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,090
them there they all say ice on the side

299
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:44,740
so I just asked them to send me one

300
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:47,019
without the decal the control system

301
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,220
took months to get all so we went with

302
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:53,529
Argos and each one of those can cost up

303
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,470
to $10,000 each depending on the

304
00:14:53,529 --> 00:15:01,689
components that you would want to have

305
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:03,550
in any particular situation this is the

306
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,820
same company that has controllers and

307
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:08,379
most of Cornell greenhouses now they

308
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,600
have lifetime support for their

309
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,330
equipment which is kind of rare and

310
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,610
growth chamberland because if you've got

311
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,629
a commercial chamber most of them

312
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,490
stopped providing support free their

313
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,549
controller after about five years and

314
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,139
then you have to buy used parts or you

315
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,240
have to buy another controller for

316
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:30,460
thousands of dollars and you know when

317
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,500
we got 125 chambers I don't feel like

318
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,360
spending thousands of dollars for each

319
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:40,029
one to upgrade their controller so Argos

320
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,310
their system can call me text or email

321
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,259
me if there's a problem and I can log in

322
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,349
at home find out what the problem is or

323
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:49,629
I can adjust the settings of any chamber

324
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:57,670
right from my office desk or right from

325
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:59,259
home so it's very convenient all the

326
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,750
other parts that we needed were readily

327
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:05,889
available I can even get some of them

328
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:09,610
overnight and free shipping overnight to

329
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:13,120
the main parts are really one pump two

330
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,580
heat exchangers two valves two coils a

331
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,789
few fans and a couple of fluorescent

332
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:22,629
fixtures the insulated box was set on a

333
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:24,519
pedestal a sort of metal frame and that

334
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,009
brought the box up to a comfortable

335
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,139
working height

336
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,779
but still allowed it to pass underneath

337
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,580
doorways so wherever we intend this

338
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,220
chamber to go we sort of have to walk

339
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,200
that route and measure you know will it

340
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,980
fit in elevators can it fit through

341
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,860
doors these pedestals also have wheels

342
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:50,399
on them and leveling feet so we can just

343
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:53,009
roll it to wherever we need it to go the

344
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,509
pedestal also provides space underneath

345
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,480
the chamber for all the plumbing

346
00:16:54,509 --> 00:17:00,569
so no more plumbing on top of the

347
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,340
chamber we learned our lesson and we

348
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,828
also didn't put plumbing along the sides

349
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,880
in the back of the chamber either that

350
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:11,819
way these chambers can be stacked side

351
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,730
to side and back to back to maximize the

352
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,649
number of them we can fit into a room

353
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,529
because most chamber rooms that we have

354
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,120
around in different buildings are really

355
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:24,389
not big enough

356
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,859
this way we can really pack them in so

357
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,860
that was the idea there

358
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:34,559
if repairs are ever needed we just need

359
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,720
to take that panel off and we can get to

360
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,480
all the working working components but

361
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,850
so far we haven't had to repair this

362
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,519
chamber it's been more than four years

363
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:46,500
since it was built and it hasn't stopped

364
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,829
working yet and I've replaced the light

365
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,680
bulbs once it's hard to avoid doing that

366
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:55,589
but that's been it and this chamber is

367
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,670
very energy efficient we took the basic

368
00:17:55,589 --> 00:18:01,379
concept of the percival design using the

369
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,660
chilled water and the building reheat

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,480
water to regulate the temperature and we

371
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,630
approved it a little and here's how we

372
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,569
did it I want to think another

373
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:18,430
look at the wild coils here this is a

374
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:22,240
wild chamber here we have a coil for hot

375
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:24,130
water and a coil for cold water when the

376
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,019
chamber needs to warm up a valve would

377
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:32,110
send hot water into the hot coil and air

378
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:35,470
would blow past that warmed coil and

379
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:37,059
bring warmer air into the chamber but

380
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,720
just before the chamber reaches the

381
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:46,869
desired temperature the computer control

382
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,670
system tells the valve to close and the

383
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:52,239
very hot but there's still a lot of hot

384
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:54,759
water in this coil that's gradually

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,559
going to cool off but before it does

386
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,049
that temperature in the chamber

387
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,990
overshoots the setpoint so now to

388
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:04,119
compensate for that the controller tells

389
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,759
the cold valve to open up and send cold

390
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,829
water into the cold coil and now this

391
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,049
coil is battling this coil for the

392
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:14,139
setpoint temperature and that sort of

393
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,730
battle just keeps going on and on it

394
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,740
kind of lessens over time and the

395
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,220
overshooting kind of diminishes a little

396
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:26,859
bit but it's still not as efficient as

397
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,100
it could be well I don't know if you can

398
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:31,509
see the red very well hopefully you can

399
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:37,869
this is a graph of that temperature

400
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:39,670
battle the yellow line is the setpoint

401
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:41,949
line and right now the chamber at

402
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,620
eight-thirty the Chamber's coming out of

403
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:49,710
day setting and wants to be at 17 C for

404
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:52,179
the duration of the night so the water

405
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,650
cold water is going into the cold coil

406
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,470
it drops the temperature but look how

407
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,630
far it overshoots and here the hot coil

408
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,549
is getting more water and it's coming up

409
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,950
here and now the cold coil comes on and

410
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:08,259
this just keeps on going that's you know

411
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,360
this is an exaggerated example sort of

412
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,579
usually it's not a full degree above and

413
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,439
below the set point but the slide is

414
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,099
there kind of to demonstrate what's

415
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,100
going on

416
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:25,079
the chamber crew thought seeing this

417
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,910
kind of thing happen all the time that

418
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,038
if the water going into the chamber was

419
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,798
already at the set point that you want

420
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,869
the chamber to be at the chamber would

421
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,599
only need one set of coils and not two

422
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:39,029
and the temperature would become much

423
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,349
more stable and that's exactly what

424
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,450
happened

425
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:47,159
but first when we built the prototype

426
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:50,509
and tested it the valves that we thought

427
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:55,110
were gonna do a really good job didn't

428
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:57,629
it turned out that the valve it when you

429
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:59,849
programmed it to open the minimum it

430
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,030
would open with 7% of its full capacity

431
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:05,399
and that was too much it sent too much

432
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:08,099
hot or too much cold into the system at

433
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,909
any one time so we had to start looking

434
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:14,009
for another valve and we eventually

435
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:15,929
found a magnetic valve with it would

436
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:18,509
only open a very small amount and that

437
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,759
just let a little bit of cold or a

438
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:25,048
little bit of hot into the system at any

439
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:28,470
one time now this chamber maintains the

440
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:31,168
temperature to within a few hundredths

441
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:35,909
of a degree of the setpoint that redline

442
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:39,320
now lays down right on top so that was

443
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:43,620
the key is finding that magnetic valve

444
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:46,079
here's a basic schematic of the plumbing

445
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,298
system there are three things in

446
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,599
constant motion at all times on this in

447
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,779
our system this circulating pump just

448
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,240
keeps that water flowing from inside the

449
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,190
chamber from outside the chamber to

450
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,288
inside the chamber through the coils

451
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,110
where the fans blow the air past and

452
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:06,890
then it goes back out again and gets

453
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:09,538
recirculated all the while these sensors

454
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,140
located at various points along the line

455
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:17,450
are figuring out just what's happening

456
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,400
with the temperature in that loop if

457
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,809
for some reason the chamber is warming

458
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:28,650
up a little bit the controller tells

459
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,480
this cold water valve to open and then

460
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,700
that opens a little bit of water flows

461
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,640
through the exchanger it comes out cold

462
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,340
and so the sensor determines that this

463
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,560
loop is now at the setpoint and it will

464
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,459
close that valve and now the temperature

465
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,490
remains at the setpoint if the chamber

466
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,710
is going from night time to day time and

467
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,150
needs to go up by 10 degrees the

468
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,680
controller will tell this valve to open

469
00:22:51,150 --> 00:23:02,009
up a fair amount so that this loop then

470
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:03,690
becomes 10 degrees warmer and then as it

471
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,859
maintains temperature during the day of

472
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,049
these sensors are just kind of

473
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:10,019
monitoring the situation tweaking those

474
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,669
valves a little bit as needed to keep

475
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:15,210
that temperature where it's supposed to

476
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,710
be the system is a little bit more

477
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,860
energy efficient than the personal

478
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,809
chambers but it is a lot more efficient

479
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,179
than the traditional chambers that it

480
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,210
was built to replace here's a slide that

481
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:30,600
compares the two chambers obviously

482
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:34,380
that's the prototype there there is the

483
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:39,000
sheer 6310 both of those chambers are

484
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,950
the same amount of square feet and we

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,769
have 20 of those shears by the way

486
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,620
you're scattered around campus when we

487
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,930
analyze the electrical consumption of

488
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:52,529
these two chambers we set each of them

489
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:55,950
at the exact same conditions and then we

490
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:59,069
hooked up our power recorders and those

491
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,779
recorders ran for exactly 24 hours and

492
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:03,149
when it was done we were able to

493
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,379
download these graphs of the electrical

494
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:10,140
activity over that 24 hour period

495
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:14,970
so obviously the x-axis is time the

496
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:19,820
y-axis is watts and in this graph right

497
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:23,940
here the y-axis starts at zero watts on

498
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:26,099
this graph the y axis starts at 2000

499
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,259
watts so if I were to superimpose this

500
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,689
graph on top of this one that graph

501
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,140
wouldn't even start until what did i do

502
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,269
there there we go

503
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,480
this graph will

504
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:41,059
there wouldn't even start till halfway

505
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,269
so it gives you a visual idea of how

506
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:47,210
much less energy this thing uses when we

507
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,779
did all the math converting watts to

508
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:54,079
kilowatts and time to instead of 24

509
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:58,430
hours to one year this chamber

510
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:02,449
calculated out to $2,100 of electricity

511
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:14,150
per year this one 325 so that's the

512
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:15,890
savings of 85% this chamber is currently

513
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,660
being used for research at Weill Hall

514
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,480
and as I mentioned it's worked perfectly

515
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,000
for four years but you know this design

516
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:29,799
can work well for larger chambers too

517
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,390
and here is a slide of the chamber that

518
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,250
my crew just finished a few months ago

519
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,890
it's just ten times larger than the

520
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,710
original the interior square feet is a

521
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,230
hundred and it's designed to replace

522
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,549
those 22 walk-in chambers down at the

523
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,710
Democrat that are over 50 years old all

524
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:51,019
the lights in this chamber some of the

525
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,390
electrical conduit assemblies and the

526
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:55,639
vent louvers were all taken out of these

527
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,650
old 50 year old chambers and repurposed

528
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,780
into this one

529
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,330
those lights were part of a retrofit

530
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:04,279
that NYSERDA gave us you know about

531
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:10,429
seven or eight years ago they're still

532
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:12,589
doing well so we just reused them we got

533
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,930
another controller from Argos obviously

534
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:16,609
and this time we got the insulated box

535
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,759
from Bali which many of you probably

536
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:22,099
know is a large manufacturer of coolers

537
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,619
and they have a large variety of

538
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:27,019
different size boxes that we could get

539
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:29,809
so this time I told them to send me one

540
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:36,500
without their refrigeration no longer

541
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:39,740
required the total cost for parts for

542
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,289
this chamber was about 30

543
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,539
thousand dollars just twenty thousand of

544
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:48,769
it alone went for the controller in the

545
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:50,240
box we needed bigger fans because of the

546
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,069
size of the chamber it was so much

547
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,230
bigger than the other one but the

548
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,928
plumbing parts that we used for this

549
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,839
chamber are the exact same ones that we

550
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:02,240
used in small prototype the same pump

551
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,919
the same heat exchangers the same

552
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,839
magnetic valves and we're getting the

553
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,990
same result

554
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,939
this chamber works really well it

555
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,740
maintains very tight temperature control

556
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:17,150
usually about a tenth of a degree

557
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,589
centigrade now that's not as amazing as

558
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,050
what the smaller one does but the

559
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:27,558
smaller one is obviously a lot less

560
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:31,039
cubic feet to have to deal with other

561
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:33,769
than the fans in the side walls all the

562
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,740
working parts are located on the back of

563
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:39,558
the chamber each part is easily

564
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,179
accessible and easily removable for a

565
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,240
quick change out whenever that might

566
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:47,570
become necessary that's that's another

567
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,130
cool thing about these chambers the same

568
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:52,939
plumbing parts are used in every chamber

569
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:56,059
so we would only have to stock a few

570
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,360
parts to be able to be used anytime on

571
00:27:56,058 --> 00:28:01,308
any chamber it's a lot different than

572
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,250
way it is now we have to have a large

573
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:07,549
part inventory the chamber is currently

574
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,259
working at GU Turman in room 139 and you

575
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,029
are welcome to check it out anytime

576
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:13,308
you're up there just feel free to walk

577
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:15,678
in there are plants in there but it's

578
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:17,629
not an experiment we just wanted to see

579
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:24,019
how different species would grow in that

580
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:26,359
chamber I should mention that

581
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:28,519
since gue Turman does not have the

582
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:31,220
infrastructure like wile howl to support

583
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,009
this kind of chamber we had to design it

584
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,239
with its own chiller see if I can get

585
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:40,729
that loud turning it off there's the

586
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:41,960
chiller and its own hot water heater so

587
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:45,950
the chamber you're kind of used with

588
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,989
that equipment until such time as we can

589
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:55,729
get a new infrastructure in order meant

590
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:58,548
to support this kind of system so now we

591
00:28:55,729 --> 00:29:02,509
have a 10 square foot prototype and a

592
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:04,278
hundred square foot prototype chamber we

593
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:05,989
still need a few different chamber sizes

594
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:07,419
to accommodate all the different kinds

595
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:10,629
of research done here

596
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:13,788
for instance Bradfield in plant science

597
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:15,558
would probably benefit by having some

598
00:29:13,788 --> 00:29:19,819
chambers that are designed for a rabid

599
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:22,908
abscess research with that in mind the

600
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:27,798
crew has now started to work on a third

601
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:32,149
prototype this one has 30 square feet of

602
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:35,079
growing space the the footprint of that

603
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:37,969
box is 15 square feet but the plan is to

604
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:40,519
put a shelf

605
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,500
right across the middle giving us two

606
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,210
growing spaces and each space would have

607
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,220
its own lights so that would be 30

608
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:51,259
square feet total it is possible that we

609
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,200
could use some white LED lights in this

610
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:55,788
chamber we're looking into it right now

611
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,669
we would get more energy savings from

612
00:29:55,788 --> 00:30:01,339
LEDs and the lights would almost never

613
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:03,320
have to be replaced this chamber could

614
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:05,298
go 50 years and we may not have to do

615
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,579
anything to it

616
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:12,500
I guess that's wishful thinking I

617
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:14,000
suppose once this chamber is finished

618
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,558
we're going to move it to Weill Hall and

619
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,409
connect it up to that infrastructure to

620
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:21,648
test it and then maybe we'll look into a

621
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:23,690
fourth prototype this time maybe a step

622
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:27,378
in model with 50 square feet so that

623
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:31,548
would give us a 10 30 a 50 a hundred

624
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:34,189
square foot size chamber I don't think

625
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:37,398
we would need any different sizes than

626
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,110
that but we might want to vary the kind

627
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:42,138
of features that are available in these

628
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:44,359
chambers certainly the walkins would

629
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:46,069
benefit from having some HID lights

630
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,538
rather than just fluorescents for those

631
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:53,329
high light requiring crops and maybe co2

632
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:56,179
capability and some regions or steppings

633
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:58,359
would be helpful so we will look into

634
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:58,360
that

635
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,118
[Music]

636
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,519
so the 64 million dollar question is so

637
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,558
when are we going to start mass

638
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:14,538
producing these things well there's some

639
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,168
things we got to consider before we jump

640
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:21,950
into it and the first is who is going to

641
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:23,830
build them because we can't as long as

642
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:27,259
we're building a prototype we're okay

643
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:28,908
but once we start mass producing them we

644
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:32,269
are going to need to hire that out and

645
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:34,190
pay prevailing Union wage and I'm ok

646
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:38,179
with that I would like to collaborate on

647
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:40,340
this kind of thing but realize that the

648
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,970
cost to build them will probably about

649
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,970
double

650
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,200
our cost to build this this big one was

651
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,519
kind of deceiving it costs $30,000

652
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,279
actually that labor would about double

653
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,980
that but when you consider the Cornell

654
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,519
recently purchased a commercial growth

655
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,250
chamber of the same size for a hundred

656
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,900
and eighty thousand dollars the sixty

657
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:09,720
thousand dollar price tag for this

658
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:12,550
chamber is a little bit easier to take

659
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,880
the same thing applies for this small

660
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:18,129
chamber it's not exactly as dramatic

661
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,380
this one was twenty thousand dollars for

662
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,050
parts so if labor adds another twenty

663
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,780
thousand the forty thousand dollar cost

664
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:27,809
for this chamber still beats the

665
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:31,079
approximate eighty thousand dollar cost

666
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:34,329
to get a commercial chamber of this size

667
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:38,819
so now that we've broached the subject

668
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:43,240
of money the second consideration is

669
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:45,939
where are we going to get it right now

670
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,809
there are 57 walk-in and reach in

671
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:54,340
chambers in operation and they're

672
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:56,409
between 55 45 and 55 years old these

673
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:59,139
machines are being trusted with your

674
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,180
research obligations whether we want to

675
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,440
think about it or not those chambers are

676
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,730
gonna need to be replaced soon we really

677
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,360
should have been planning on doing that

678
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:14,650
20 years ago but I would like to replace

679
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:17,649
those 57 chambers with 62 of the

680
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:23,019
prototype style chambers and I recently

681
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:26,019
did the math 27 walk in chambers plus 35

682
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:28,960
reach-in chambers would cost about seven

683
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:31,710
point six million dollars if we purchase

684
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
them from a commercial chamber company

685
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,440
if we paid somebody to build them

686
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,819
ourselves it would cost approximately

687
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,590
three million dollars so we know that

688
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:47,439
somehow we're gonna have to get new

689
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:50,980
chambers pretty soon I'd like to save

690
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,259
4.6 million dollars when we do it

691
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,529
even a three million dollar price tag is

692
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:59,109
hard to swallow so I would like to do

693
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:02,680
this in a gradual way to lessen the

694
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:04,299
impact I would like to concentrate on

695
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,480
replacing all the chambers in one

696
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:09,610
building at one time and then do the

697
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,699
same thing in another building about two

698
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:16,120
to three years later until all the 50

699
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,668
year old chambers are gone that way the

700
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,789
cost is spread out over time and it's

701
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:26,079
something that we could budget for last

702
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:29,860
year to sort of help with finding a way

703
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,199
to purchase chambers the Cornell AG

704
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,500
Experiment Station set up a depreciation

705
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:38,168
fund for chambers and chamber fees were

706
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,199
raised 15% and that money goes into a

707
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:44,440
depreciation fund so in the extended

708
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,889
future we may have a way to do this in a

709
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,579
gradual way changing out chambers every

710
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,559
30 or 40 years but in the immediate

711
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:59,079
future we're still going to need a way

712
00:34:53,559 --> 00:35:02,199
to find some money so somehow we'll get

713
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:05,799
it somewhere there's one more thing to

714
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,329
consider building these prototypes and

715
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,560
installing them at Weill Hall is very

716
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,759
easy that building is set up for them

717
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,940
unfortunately no other building is set

718
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,950
up that way right now but some buildings

719
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,710
would be easier to modify than others

720
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:23,259
Bradfield's for instance there's already

721
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:30,039
access to chilled water here same with

722
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:30,920
plant science we could insert a a heat

723
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,019
exchange

724
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,880
into the chilled water line in the

725
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:38,000
mechanical space directly behind the

726
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,480
chamber room and then plumb in a

727
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,679
dedicated loop from that chilled water

728
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,449
right into the chamber room and do the

729
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,239
same for the building reheat water that

730
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:50,000
way all the chambers in that room could

731
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:52,939
be served with this infrastructure and

732
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,829
it would be not near as big as doing say

733
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:02,809
a while hall or a GU term and the rooms

734
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:04,130
are much bigger there so campus chilled

735
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,500
water is just not available everywhere

736
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:10,039
it's not available it can poster in

737
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,838
Sector E maybe someday but it's probably

738
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:17,179
never going to be available out at GU

739
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:20,119
termen so in that kind of situation we

740
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:21,588
would have to install a large chiller to

741
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,990
generate the amount of chilled water

742
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:29,179
that's going to be required to serve a

743
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:30,828
room full of chambers the infrastructure

744
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:34,818
there would have to be completely redone

745
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:39,500
and that is obviously that would be

746
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:42,108
expensive but at GU Turman if 40

747
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,559
chambers are served by this one

748
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:47,000
infrastructure that kind of spreads the

749
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:49,010
cost out a little bit it makes it a

750
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,318
little more acceptable and when you

751
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,020
factor in the savings you would get by

752
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:56,449
building these chambers here combined

753
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:59,269
with the energy savings you get every

754
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:01,189
year for the life of the chamber the

755
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:02,960
payback rate on that investment of

756
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:06,019
infrastructure it looks a little bit

757
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,990
more reasonable and we've shown these

758
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:12,199
chambers to people who are in a position

759
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:14,838
to make projects like this happen and

760
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,578
they were very impressed with the

761
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:18,489
accomplishment of the chamber crew I

762
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:23,930
mean look at that thing it's gorgeous

763
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:27,649
well if you like chambers but so they

764
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:29,358
were impressed with it they but they

765
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,430
also understand all the things that they

766
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,848
have to consider before they jump ahead

767
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:37,368
with this kind of project in the end you

768
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,890
know there are many many priorities that

769
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:42,930
need attention to Cal's

770
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:50,190
and growth chambers are just one of them

771
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:53,639
so I want to show you who's responsible

772
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,829
here there are two people responsible

773
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,210
above all others for the design and

774
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,980
construction of these prototypes and

775
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,769
that's Bob Wilson on the left and mark

776
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,480
Daly on the right they did the whole

777
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:07,019
thing from start to finish it's their

778
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,599
design charles duffy the third member of

779
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:12,480
the chamber crew also helped out by

780
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,980
contributing ideas to its design and he

781
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,559
and Bob would bounce ideas off each

782
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,420
other for many years and those ideas

783
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,420
eventually led to coming up with this

784
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,349
this chamber crew is really the only

785
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:27,538
reason we can still use 50 year old

786
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:30,829
chambers here they really know how to

787
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:33,028
fix them Andy lead and I also

788
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:36,089
contributed a little bit to the design

789
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:39,150
but it was primarily Bob and mark who

790
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:42,328
brought this concept to a reality I also

791
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,548
want to thank Peter paradise he was

792
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,380
responsible for providing the funds for

793
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:49,139
us to build the large prototype that's

794
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,240
out accouterment until recently he was

795
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:54,269
the assistant dean for Cal's facilities

796
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:57,838
and now he is the associate dean for

797
00:38:54,269 --> 00:39:01,019
Finance Cal's and another person who

798
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:03,210
deserves credit and thanks plenty of it

799
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:06,869
is Mike Hoffman he's the former director

800
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,818
of the Cornell Experiment Station about

801
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:10,470
five years ago he trusted this crew

802
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:13,170
enough to give us the money to build

803
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:16,618
that first prototype but he and Glenn

804
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,240
Evans were very supportive now yaanai

805
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,920
Rapp is the head of the Cornell

806
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,429
Experiment Station and he and Glenn

807
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,490
continue to give us the support we need

808
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:29,068
also John Conklin he works out a campus

809
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:31,828
area he's in the shop at campus area

810
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:35,639
farms and he fabricated all those

811
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:38,099
pedestals that the boxes sit on and last

812
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,929
but not least Anja Tim is an

813
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,869
administrative assistant at the Cornell

814
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:44,639
Experiment Station and she was very

815
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:47,059
essential because she showed me how to

816
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:51,480
put together a PowerPoint presentation

817
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:54,619
I've never done this before so also she

818
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,690
found a source for these these

819
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,269
translucent

820
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,190
CUA es logos that light up in the

821
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:02,588
windows of these prototypes when during

822
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:08,380
the daytime and that's a nice touch so I

823
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:10,900
appreciate her help yeah so that is

824
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,780
probably more than you ever expected to

825
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,309
know about growth chambers in your life

826
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,819
if you have any questions I'd be happy

827
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:17,818
to answer

828
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:25,469
[Applause]

829
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:34,808
Lisa what's the current occupancy rate

830
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:37,660
for kills users I would say it's in

831
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:39,459
excess of 95 percent I can tell you off

832
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:42,548
the top of my head which chambers are

833
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:44,379
available and it's easy because there

834
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:48,778
aren't very many that are available so I

835
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,778
might have five that are available

836
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:57,380
I'd liked the ideally I would like to

837
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,789
have 10% excess capacity so that people

838
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,340
don't have to be put on a waiting list

839
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,199
when they want to chamber there's no sin

840
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,210
in having a chamber sit idle I don't

841
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,059
think if it if it's ready and available

842
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,858
when somebody needs it and they can be

843
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:11,000
just shut off you don't have to sit

844
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:13,279
there and run all the time we can just

845
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,320
turn them right off can't really do that

846
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,540
with the old 50 year old ones because

847
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,519
those refrigeration units don't like to

848
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:23,269
be shut off they start leaking

849
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:39,800
refrigerant after a while any other

850
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:41,630
questions yeah we that question kind of

851
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,230
almost leads into whether we got a

852
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:47,930
patent on this or not so that we could

853
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:50,389
start a company and Cornell sent people

854
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:52,730
out here as soon as that first prototype

855
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:56,750
was built and they did all the research

856
00:41:52,730 --> 00:42:00,079
and told me it's not patentable and I'm

857
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:02,300
basically I'd be open to anything that

858
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,000
gets us new chambers if Cornell wants to

859
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:09,589
start a business it'd be fine with me I

860
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,510
don't want to that time has come and

861
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:12,829
gone for me I think approaching

862
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,990
retirement age and I'm not ready to

863
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:17,170
start a business but I don't think my

864
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:20,358
crew isn't that interested in it either

865
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,789
but whatever we can do to help bring

866
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:27,489
more chambers here is fine with us

867
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:30,619
oh you know no problem

868
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:33,739
Jeff either one slide to show you the

869
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:35,210
energy savings between the prototype and

870
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,479
one of the other changes of the levers a

871
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:41,570
significant savings there is most of

872
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,300
that the heat exchanger chilled water

873
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,880
setup versus the situation our first

874
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,010
it's mostly there so but I'm just

875
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,079
thinking you hear three versus seven

876
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:54,140
seven million dollars doesn't take into

877
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:58,789
account savings right in energy you're

878
00:42:54,139 --> 00:43:00,559
gonna realize there as well right those

879
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:02,019
two really should be added together to

880
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,190
get the full impact

881
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:07,329
what this thing every down between

882
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,220
universes speaking before them saying

883
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:11,769
Braddock enduring saying he didn't show

884
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:13,419
water yeah we could do that yeah we

885
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,730
wouldn't have to invest in a chiller in

886
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,039
this building right behind that chamber

887
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,369
room is chilled water pipes that we

888
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:25,960
could tap into

889
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:28,449
so I'd like to start in Bradfield just

890
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,039
convincing people who might or may not

891
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:32,039
have the money at the current moment

892
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:40,869
well I had heard that they're going to

893
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,819
upgrade the infrastructure in this

894
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:46,150
building so I sent a drawing off to

895
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:49,210
those people saying behind g12 Bradfield

896
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,690
could you insert a heat exchanger right

897
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,460
there

898
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,460
put a couple of valves in it that we can

899
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,110
we can just tap into that when the time

900
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,920
would come and then we could get the

901
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:02,620
chilled water so I was told that my

902
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:08,710
drawing went on to whoever's in charge

903
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:11,619
of that project so well see all this is

904
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,900
news to me yeah that's good

905
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:18,909
and Peter of course you care that is all

906
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,910
about that so well there's a grungy old

907
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:23,739
room in the basement bo6

908
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:26,769
that used to have more chambers in it

909
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:30,639
than it does now but I've figured out

910
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:32,019
that that room could fit 11 chambers not

911
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,150
just this size but the one with the

912
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:35,980
double doors on it we could fit 11 of

913
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,690
those down there and that would be

914
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,829
perfect for a rabid abscess research

915
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:43,980
where a lot of the people in that

916
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:43,980
building are doing that kind of work so

917
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:49,179
chilled water isn't far away from that

918
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:53,859
room and we could bring it in and Chris

919
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:56,739
Martin okay I mean this whole thing was

920
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:02,099
here but this is something she'd be

921
00:44:56,739 --> 00:45:02,099
interested in well I'd be happy to

922
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:18,380
this has been a production of Cornell

923
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,380
University on the web at Cornell edu
