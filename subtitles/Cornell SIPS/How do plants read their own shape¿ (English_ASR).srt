1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,519
University all right thank you VCH and

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,798
thank you Adrien for the invitation it's

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,679
a pleasure to be here and indeed so I'm

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,559
going to talk about plan development so

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,160
not myis I left the field a little bit

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
in the years maybe I will come back to

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,198
it I don't know uh okay so my question

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,079
today is how do plant read their own

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
shape uh this might be a bit of a

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,558
cryptic question but it's a way to

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,439
address the role of mechanical signals

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,280
in

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,799
developments but I guess it's going to

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,399
be clearer with the the presentation so

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,038
one thing that okay I need to use this

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,878
uh one thing is for sure is that there's

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,359
a lot of data in the literature showing

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,159
that cells are able to sense their

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,320
mechanical environment and one thing for

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,238
instance is that if you so this is all

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,000
in animals if you grow a single cell on

23
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,198
a micro pattern like this you can

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,679
actually predict the orientation of the

25
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,759
spindle and the next Division and this

26
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,239
is due to the fact that because it the

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,200
addition pattern is biased by the

28
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,478
pattern then you bias also the spindle

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,960
but this is the force within the cell

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,118
that is guiding the the spindle

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,199
orientation another thing has been shown

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,118
also for cell division is that if you

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,560
compress or stretch a cell you're going

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,280
to accelerate or decelerate uh the the

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Mito mitotic

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,400
progression okay so that's one example

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,040
but there's another one that is maybe

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,159
even uh Stronger I would say is that if

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,560
you grow stem cells so mimal stem cells

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,920
on substrate so this it has exactly the

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,159
same chemical composition the only

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,280
difference is the stiffness of the

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,320
substrate so if you grow those stem

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,879
cells on soft matrices you get a

45
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,038
neuroblast if you grow the same stem

46
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,478
cell on a stiff Matrix you get an noo

47
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,759
blast so it means that the mechanical

48
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,599
environment or in this case The Matrix

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
is defining the

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,879
sufate in this case and what's also

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
interesting is that so you have this

52
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,280
relation with stiffness but the entire

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,680
cell is actually uh changing so if you

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,159
if you grow those stem cells they're

55
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,280
going to have a more dense extracellular

56
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,878
Matrix they're going to have more

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,878
cytoskeleton and uh the even the nuclei

58
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,239
is going to become the nucleus is going

59
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,919
to become stiffer on a stiffer medium so

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,039
you completely reprogram the cell based

61
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,439
on the mechanical environment of this

62
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,840
cell okay so this is at the Single Cell

63
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,199
level and there's a lot of data at the

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,598
Single Cell level there's fewer data at

65
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,639
the multicellular level of course

66
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,318
because it's much more difficult to

67
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,318
address and it's also well it's more

68
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,518
complex to interpret also but the

69
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:53,359
general idea would be that you have a

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,239
gene Network here uh in one cell this is

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,879
impacting the mechanical properties of

72
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,000
the cell this is changing the shape of

73
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,679
the cell this is changing the the shape

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,560
of the overall organ

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,239
tissue and this in turn because there is

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,280
growth in there there is to pressure

77
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,840
there is mechanical stress here this in

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,560
turn could feedback on the gene Network

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,200
and you realize that at this point this

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,400
is a mechanism that is allowing the

81
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,919
tissue or the cells to know where they

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
are um all the tissue what size it has

83
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,399
so it's it's a sensing mechanism for

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,360
shape in a way so if you read mechanical

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,438
signals you can know your shape and then

86
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,239
you can adjust you can buffer your size

87
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,158
so you can do a lot of things so that's

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,280
the let's say the conceptual framework

89
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,639
for this reading shape thing and here

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,438
I'm focusing on the mechanical signals

91
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,399
but of course there are over signals too

92
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,560
we can do the same feedback loop with

93
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,920
biochemical signals only I'm just saying

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,878
that here I'm looking at the

95
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,958
contribution of mechanical signals in

96
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,120
this feedback loop okay so uh the fact

97
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,360
that there is mechanical stress in this

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,200
tissue can be a bit mysterious so I just

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,120
want to clarify this point with some

100
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:05,959
very B basic images so if you have a

101
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,920
bunch of rods piled together now you put

102
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,598
a thread between those rods what happens

103
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,280
here is that this structure is stable

104
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,959
it's metast stable if you want so it's

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,358
not going to collapse it's it's there it

106
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,600
looks inert but actually what is in this

107
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,560
structure is a balance between tension

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,400
and compression so all the threads here

109
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,319
are under tension they're pulled and the

110
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,359
rods are under compression so want to

111
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,399
simplify

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,919
and it's it's this balance between

113
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,079
tension and compression that makes this

114
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,159
structure

115
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:42,879
stable so okay this is very theoretical

116
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,280
but it applies to shapes and biology so

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,478
if I take probably the simpler shape you

118
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,799
can imagine a balloon or a sphere a

119
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,959
balloon is a stable shape but it's

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,439
stable because there is a gas inside

121
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,560
that is under compression and there is

122
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,160
an envelope that is under tension and

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,079
it's the balance between tension and

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,800
compression that allows the balloon to

125
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,038
be stable uh in shape you can also

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,478
generate flat shapes with a balance

127
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,839
between tension and compression so this

128
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,560
is the the kite example so you have two

129
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,799
rods under compression and the membrane

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
that is under tension is pulled and with

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
this uh balance you can have flat shapes

132
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
and of course you can generate any

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
shapes and that's what the modern

134
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,519
architecture is all about so I don't

135
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,198
know about the brutalist architecture

136
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,038
but any architecture you can use this

137
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,160
feature all right so all this is for

138
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,159
buildings so you could ask a question

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,199
whether it's applicable to a living

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,400
organism and of course it is so here if

141
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,080
you again an animal example but if you

142
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,719
if you go through a section of a human

143
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,839
fmer you see this pattern of trul in the

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
in the F it's very intricate very

145
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,000
organized but you can also see that

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
there is a pattern it's not random and

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,639
if you cut several F you always see this

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,639
kind of overall pattern so now if you

149
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,038
calculate the pattern of stress of

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,639
mechanical stress in in this tissue

151
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,879
you'll see here that there is uh tension

152
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,879
and here there's compression it's

153
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,560
basically the the weight that you put on

154
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,159
your fmer and what you see also is that

155
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,680
this pattern of stress is matching the

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,199
overall the the pillars in the in the

157
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,400
fer the trul orientation in the in the F

158
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,400
so that means that the bone is building

159
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,959
to resist to Mechanical stress so you

160
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,038
build the pillar to resist in this case

161
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,159
to mainly to to compression so it's a

162
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,439
little bit like in the building you

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,400
build a vertical wall to resist

164
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:38,439
gravity okay so this is for solid solid

165
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,439
medium let's say so what we are working

166
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,800
on is soft usually it's soft matter so

167
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,319
is this true also for soft matter answer

168
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,280
is yes so here I take the example of the

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,240
the saval paper in 2011 where what is

170
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,399
looked at is a mouse intestine intestine

171
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,680
and so you have this uh well spring

172
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,120
shape I would say like this cir voluted

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
shape and so we want to know

174
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,079
what is there any forces in this

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,279
structure so what he did was an anog

176
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,959
analog model so here you put you take

177
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,719
two pieces of rubber you stretch one and

178
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,279
then you GL you glue the two pieces

179
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,319
together and then you relax and what you

180
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,638
get is this so you get a structure the

181
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,879
shape of this structure is relatively

182
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,280
similar it's not the same scale of

183
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,039
course but it's the shape itself the

184
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,559
geometry is relatively similar to this

185
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,199
one so this is an indication that maybe

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,160
in this structure there is also a

187
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,960
balance between tension and compression

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
and that is what is generating this

189
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,399
actually that's something you can even

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,280
feel when you do a dissection of a mouse

191
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,000
and you get to the intese it looks very

192
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,478
springy right so that fits with this

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,319
idea but the the best actually

194
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,839
demonstration is to do the reverse

195
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,000
experiment where you take your intestine

196
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,279
you you cut the tube and you cut the

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,800
meant tree so the two pieces and what

198
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,679
you see that the tube is expanding and

199
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,879
the mes is Contracting so again it

200
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,879
reveals that there was a balance between

201
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,599
tension and compression in

202
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,560
this

203
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,240
organ all right so I'm going to stop

204
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,399
here for the animals now I'm going to

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,120
plants so in Plants it's the same idea

206
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,439
and actually in all living organism it's

207
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
the same there's always the balance

208
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,158
between tension and compression I mean I

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,158
should never say always but usually

210
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:22,120
there is a balance between tension and

211
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,240
compression so here I'm just taking an

212
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,079
example so the the radishes it's a

213
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,360
classic example that I like to use so if

214
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,758
you do a radish salad the first thing

215
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,240
you do is that you cut the radish and

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,200
they pop open so they pop open because

217
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,560
the epidermis is under tension and the

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,080
tissue inside is under compression

219
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,278
there's also a classic example is the

220
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
the rebarb so if you have rebarb and you

221
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,399
peel the epidermis or the cortex of the

222
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,160
rebarb and you do you do that in water

223
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,759
to avoid dehydration uh you see that the

224
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,319
cortex is going to contract which means

225
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,919
that it was under compression under

226
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,879
tension before right it was a tension we

227
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,078
peel it so it

228
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:04,000
contracts all right so here I just want

229
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:07,039
to quote Carl's work here because there

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,078
this very important paper summarizing

231
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,078
this idea and going into more detail to

232
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:12,719
show that really it's the epidermis

233
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:15,399
usually in most tissues in most plant

234
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,120
tissues or iil tissues usually that are

235
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,159
under tension and this has a primary

236
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,360
role in um growth and morphogenesis for

237
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,919
plants okay so now into what we're doing

238
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,720
more specifically so here is just a

239
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,759
scheme that I I stole from ja dum uh so

240
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,480
this is a plant cell or really

241
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,679
simplified scheme of a plant cell so you

242
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,839
have TGO pressure inside the cell wall

243
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,519
is resisting to this TGO pressure and

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,079
you have aligned cellulose microfibrils

245
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,720
that are driving the direction of growth

246
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,399
of this cell which is orthogonal to the

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,759
cellulose microfi I guess to this

248
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
audience I don't know I don't need to go

249
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,838
into full details you're I guess all

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,519
aware of this this fact all right so

251
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,399
what is controlling the deposition of

252
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,000
the cellulose microf fds what's

253
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,720
generally accepted is that it's the macr

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,278
tributes that are guiding the deposition

255
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,200
of cellulose in the cell wall so here

256
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,519
you have a piece of the plasma membrane

257
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,240
the cellulose sentes is here it's

258
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,360
extruding cellulose inside the cell wall

259
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,560
and just beneath the plasma membrane you

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,639
have the cortical macules here and the

261
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,919
cellulos SAS is basically moving along

262
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,559
the microt tubules so it's not always

263
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,240
true and there are exceptions but in

264
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,078
most tissues actually the the more we

265
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,079
get data and live Imaging data the more

266
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:32,399
we see this type of behavior so that's

267
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:36,479
really interesting for us because now we

268
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,278
can easily Image micr Dynamics with gfp

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,800
markers and we can can have an indirect

270
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,320
image of the deposition of cellulose

271
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,879
inside the cell wall and as you may

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
understand cellulose is much more

273
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,679
difficult to image because it's inside

274
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,639
the cell wall we can't really put any

275
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,679
fluoresent marker for for the cellulose

276
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,639
so we have an indirect image of

277
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,479
cellulose deposition and so we have an

278
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,399
indirect image of the mechanical

279
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,360
properties of the cell in a way because

280
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,879
we know that cellulos is as stiff as

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,879
still so we we can have an idea of in

282
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,838
which direction the the cell is going to

283
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
be stiffer than over direction right we

284
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,839
have the mechanical an isotropy of the

285
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,480
cell with the orientation of the microt

286
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,160
tributes okay so I'm going to start with

287
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,159
um an example that we on which we worked

288
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,439
the past few years which is the the

289
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,240
payment cell so here what you see is is

290
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,880
a young arabidopsis plant you have two

291
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,959
Coons and if you look at the coons you

292
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,600
see those cells that are inter digitated

293
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,599
that have a jigo puzzle shape here you

294
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,600
see a stomata so this is a typical shape

295
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,440
for epidermis it's not for all epidermis

296
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
but in arabidopsis at least it's it's

297
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,040
very clear and this is actually a very

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
well-known um cell type I would say

299
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,399
there's a lot of experiments done on

300
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
pavement cells because it's it's a

301
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,078
interesting model uh and something that

302
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,360
we know is that we know actually it's

303
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,039
been characterized already for the

304
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,839
cytoskeleton and in particular for the

305
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,679
macules so when the the cotillon is in

306
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,560
the expansion phase so when it grows at

307
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:12,719
fast speed the macules within one

308
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,518
pavement cell as a stereotypical pattern

309
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,079
in which you see those rings of macules

310
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,159
between the necks of the payment cells

311
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,198
and in the lobes there is less mic

312
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,240
tubules so it's sort of bodal

313
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,240
distribution if you want to you have a

314
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,720
lot of macut that are aligned in the ne

315
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,360
and less in the loopes

316
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,160
so of course when you see that and if

317
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,440
you um feel like the cellul is going to

318
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:40,000
be oriented same way here what we should

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,680
see is this right so you have a balloon

320
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,958
you have more microtubules so more

321
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,879
cellulose you have a ring of cellulose

322
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,518
here and this could explain why you have

323
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,278
a jigo puzzle shape so there's only

324
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,159
indirect evidence that this is the case

325
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,720
there's been some staining for cellulose

326
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,159
for the ma tuu but no mechanical

327
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,360
measurements for the stiffness of

328
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:04,000
payment cell so what we did was to um

329
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,839
adapt Atomic Force microscopy to measure

330
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,159
the mechanical properties of those cells

331
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,320
at very high resolution so in in two

332
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,759
words Atomic Force microscopy is

333
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,240
actually it's a it's a sort of a old

334
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,600
technique now but uh it's it's been used

335
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,839
a lot in Material Sciences so you use

336
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,959
here a Cy lever the micrometric C Lev or

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,279
like maybe a little bit bigger than

338
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:32,278
micrometric with a nanometric tip so so

339
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,198
here the the little the c l we use at

340
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:38,120
the end the radius is at 2 nanometer so

341
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:41,359
it's really small and we apply this Cy

342
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,639
lever on the surface and with a laser we

343
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,639
can measure the curving or the

344
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,360
deflection of the the Cy lever so if the

345
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,159
Cy lever is applied on a stiff surface

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,079
it's going to bend immediately if it's

347
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,439
applied on a soft surface is going to

348
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,679
indent the substrate and then it's going

349
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,240
to bend so you can measure the delay in

350
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,719
bending if you want with the laser

351
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,480
that's going to be proportional to the

352
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,560
stiffness of your material and if you

353
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,120
know the stiffness of your C lever then

354
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,359
you can deduce the material properties

355
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,600
of your of your tissue so of course here

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,600
we use a very small uh tip like 2

357
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,639
nanometer to only indent the like a

358
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,800
little bit of the cell wall and just to

359
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,079
have the local mechanical properties of

360
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,519
the

361
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,359
cell okay so this is the type of image

362
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,959
we get so this is uh we can get the

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
Topography of course with these images

364
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,638
so you have here like the the boundary

365
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
between two pavement cells so you see

366
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,600
again the jigo puzzle shape you have the

367
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,360
Cure so at this scale it's very very

368
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,759
bumpy as you as you can

369
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,879
tell and it's actually I mean it's it's

370
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,680
smooth it's bumpy but smooth in a way

371
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,039
but now if we get the force measurements

372
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,000
so the mechanical properties this is the

373
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,078
type of map we get of map we get so when

374
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,240
it's white it's stiff and when it's

375
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,319
black it's soft uh so when it's so I

376
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,639
should do make a little disclaimer first

377
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,360
so the really white zone or the really

378
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,320
black zone are probably artifacts or

379
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,159
zones that we cannot really interpret

380
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,639
because it's too slopy so we don't know

381
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,679
what we're doing so basically the the Cy

382
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,879
lever is inting on something that is at

383
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,679
an angle so it might slide uh I mean we

384
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,039
we don't really know what we're

385
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,319
measuring so we prefer to ignore those

386
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,958
areas whereas if you focus on the

387
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,519
relatively flat part of the cell you see

388
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,599
those lines here so you see some white

389
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,039
lines here some white lines here uh too

390
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,839
that are matching the macru pattern that

391
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,958
we saw earlier so in this case that

392
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,800
would mean that there is some wall

393
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,439
reinforcement along those lines between

394
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:45,479
the necks in those cells so that's if

395
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,800
you want one evidence that indeed those

396
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,639
cells are reinforced along those lines

397
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:54,039
matching the predicted cellulose

398
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,240
deposition we have a positive control

399
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,039
which is the stomata so as you may know

400
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
in stomata the the microtubules and the

401
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:04,278
cellulose is transverse and we see also

402
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,240
transverse stiffening in in those tissue

403
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,919
okay so this uh model I mean which it's

404
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,480
has been around this is conceptually

405
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:14,039
it's not new it's just more evidence

406
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,399
that it's true let's see but of course

407
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,919
now the question is what is orienting

408
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,000
the microt tribul so how come the micr

409
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:20,519
trules are orienting like this and

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,039
relatively stable during this fast

411
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,318
growing phase so one possibility uh is

412
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,240
that uh it's actually mechanical stress

413
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,919
that would Orient those Maes I me there

414
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
are other possib ISM I'm not saying it's

415
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,399
only mechanical stress but there are

416
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,078
here we want to test whether it's

417
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,278
mechanical stress that can Orient those

418
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,278
mutes so to do that to test this

419
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,480
hypothesis uh so pav krinski in enrik

420
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,198
Johnson lab did a Model in which he

421
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,360
could calculate the tension in the top

422
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:52,599
wall of those cells so basically you

423
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,120
have uh you take a cell you put you put

424
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,000
your pressure in it so you have cell

425
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,959
wall that is under tension so if the

426
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,078
cell wall was half sphere it was just

427
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,438
the shape of as sphere the tension would

428
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,918
be the same in all Direction so it would

429
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,079
be isotropic mechanical stress but

430
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,280
because here we start with a puzzle

431
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,318
shaped cell like this if you follow the

432
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,678
red lines which are the maximal tension

433
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,720
lines you see that they converge in the

434
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,319
neck regions and so this is the

435
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,720
prediction of the tension in in this top

436
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,558
hole and you see that it's converging in

437
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,480
those necks and of course there's a good

438
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,558
match between the predictive

439
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,079
maximal tension line pattern and the

440
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,279
orientation of the

441
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,480
maules okay so that's the idea that

442
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,798
maybe uh the macules are able to sense

443
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,480
someh this tension lines and align to

444
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,400
resist to this mechanical stress or to

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,160
allow the cellulose to resist to this

446
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,559
mechanical stress okay so first you have

447
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,759
to show that there is tension in this

448
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:56,918
tissue so this is one uh movie to show

449
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,319
that so here you have um cadon actually

450
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,640
might be a leaf in this case I'm

451
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,639
wondering now

452
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,280
I have question so you take this tissue

453
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,919
and what you do is you cut it and it's a

454
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,720
little bit like in the r Barb experiment

455
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,840
or in the radish experiment if you cut

456
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,880
it you should reveal the pattern of

457
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:16,319
stress uh in this tissue so if you do

458
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,360
that so here we've removed the large

459
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,480
part of the of the cotillon when we when

460
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,639
we cut it and what you see is that it's

461
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,720
it keeps open opening after it's been

462
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,759
cut so it means that it is under tension

463
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,759
indeed so maybe I should play it again

464
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,120
check but this is not really a surprise

465
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,679
right I mean we've all we've seen before

466
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,038
I mean Now is really accumulating

467
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,320
evidence that the epidermis is on

468
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:44,240
tension imp plant tissues so now we can

469
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:46,639
U do a model in which we uh put the

470
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,679
epidermis on the tension and we look at

471
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,038
the pattern of stress in this uh in this

472
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,480
tissue and we're going to do an oblation

473
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,839
and predict the orientation of the

474
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,240
mechanical stress pattern after ablation

475
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:02,199
so this is again what pav did so you

476
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,159
upate those cells here so you can forget

477
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,038
about the color code but what you see is

478
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,200
a circum frenal orientation of the

479
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,798
stress here which makes sense right I

480
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,960
mean it's you you if you take a piece of

481
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,599
paper you cut it it's going to tear so

482
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,480
for it not to tear you need to reinforce

483
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,119
it um around right so this is the the

484
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,599
predicted pattern of stress so now if

485
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,439
you do it on a real cotillon that's what

486
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,000
you see indeed so here you a blade a

487
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,960
large piece of the cotillon and and you

488
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
see this uh orientation of the macules

489
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,759
here so actually since then we've tried

490
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,558
to do this oblation at different stages

491
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,440
of the and there's a good match

492
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,359
between I me there's a good relation

493
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,840
between the the growth rate so if you do

494
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,719
that when the the codon is really not

495
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,439
really growing anymore you have less of

496
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,919
a response so you really need to do this

497
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,200
at the fast growing right which makes

498
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,480
sense right that's where the the stress

499
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,519
would be the the

500
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,079
highest okay so this is evidence that

501
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,158
indeed the macru can reorient to align

502
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,158
along maximal tension

503
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,039
so of course there's over experiment but

504
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,320
I'm not going to show but if you do

505
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,640
compressions or if you do a phac

506
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,839
pharmacological treatment to soften the

507
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,038
cell wall for instance so to increase

508
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,678
the stress level you also see the same

509
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:17,319
type of reorientation of the of the

510
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,000
microtubules okay so the general idea

511
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,000
then is that a cell with its microt

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,440
tribute is going to reinforce its cell

513
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,759
wall this is going to okay that's what

514
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,200
you see here so this is a different

515
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,359
color code but the pink is stiff

516
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,480
um okay so you reinforce the cell wall

517
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,599
uh this is controlling the cell shape or

518
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,159
stabilizing the cell shape if you want

519
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,639
and the shape itself is prescribing a

520
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,840
pattern of mechanical stress that in

521
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,679
turn is controlling the the micr

522
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,519
tributes right so in in this case if you

523
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,159
start with a puzzle shape you're more

524
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,119
likely to maintain a puzzle shape it's

525
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,720
not going to go towards a balloon shape

526
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,319
because of this uh feedback loop anyway

527
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,400
and so and this is a way I mean to go to

528
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,359
go back to the reading shape idea here

529
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,480
this cell is able to read its own shape

530
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,599
through this mechanical feedback and to

531
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,599
amplify or to stabilize uh its shape

532
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,759
through this mechanical feedback

533
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,480
loop okay so now if we move at a larger

534
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,158
scale so this is now it dates back like

535
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,159
a few years uh so we've done some work

536
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,159
in the in the shopical marem so this is

537
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,679
an arabidopsis again if you remove the

538
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,880
flowers when you get to this Dome of

539
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:31,200
cells so that's the sh typical marem and

540
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,520
uh the FL are on the side so here we use

541
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,640
this system I mean we can do a lot of

542
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,639
things with the marem but here we we use

543
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,559
this system as a morphogenetic model in

544
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,520
a way so this is a tissue with a

545
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,558
specific shape in a way there Dome there

546
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,119
tissue folding here and so we want to

547
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,079
see whether what we showed for the

548
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,278
payment cell is also true for the

549
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,359
marem so when you look at MCR tributes

550
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,278
in this marem so this is viewed from the

551
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,599
top so the center of the mar stem would

552
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,558
be here this is a young organ this is an

553
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,719
older organ and you see these alignments

554
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,879
of macules here between the organ and

555
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,798
the mar stem so again here an alignment

556
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,080
of macu between the organ and the mar

557
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:11,359
stem you also see this alignment of micr

558
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,158
below and this is stereotypical so we

559
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,319
always see this pattern in the mem this

560
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,320
is really like a constant thing each

561
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,879
time you look at the the M with a ma

562
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,960
marker this is what you this is what you

563
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,600
would see so here again we can make the

564
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,919
analogy with the payment cell so you

565
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,678
have here the mar stem especially in the

566
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
boundaries where you have an organ the

567
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
mar stem and you have this alignment

568
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,240
supracellular alignment of Mac in the

569
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,519
boundary looks a little bit like in

570
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,640
payment cell where you also have this

571
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,119
alignment of Mac tub between next but

572
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,960
here it's at the Single Cell level and

573
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,719
here it's a supracellular but if you for

574
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,319
if you forgot about the sub cell

575
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
division or the the cells it would be

576
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,158
basically the same so you have tension

577
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,558
lines and the Mages aligning here okay

578
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,360
so is this true so if you again assume

579
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,558
that the epidermis is under tension you

580
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,359
can calculate uh the pattern of stress

581
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,720
in this tissue and what you find is that

582
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,759
at the top because it's half sphere the

583
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,919
stress is isotropic there is no

584
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:13,000
Direction no preferential Direction uh

585
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,759
for the the stem it's a cylinder so the

586
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,038
circumferential stress is going to be

587
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,319
twice higher than the actual stress and

588
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,798
so this is well known in in engineering

589
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,399
and the mechanics this is for instance

590
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:27,119
why the when you boil sausages they're

591
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,960
going to open lengthwise because the

592
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,639
stress in the second frenal orientation

593
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,240
is larger than the actual stress so this

594
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,360
is what you would see here so if the

595
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,720
epidermis is under tension the the T the

596
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,278
tension is going to be higher in the

597
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,480
circumferential orientation than in the

598
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:42,880
actual

599
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,319
orientation and in the boundary domain

600
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,039
here so it's a bit of the mix between

601
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,798
this so This starts to be on the side of

602
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,960
the mar stem so it starts to become a

603
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,240
bit more like this but in addition you

604
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,798
have an organ here but is growing fast

605
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,480
so because it grows fast it's going to

606
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,918
compress the cells here so now you have

607
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,400
have compression in this orientation and

608
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,559
tension in that orientation so in terms

609
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,798
of tension it's really really ionotropic

610
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,759
very directional so here you have a

611
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,000
strong tension in that orientation and

612
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,839
of course when you see this it's a

613
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,119
little bit like in the fmer what I

614
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,798
showed you earlier like the Dy Thomson

615
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,359
or the wall flow on on fmer you see that

616
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,200
you have a good match between the

617
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,639
predicted pattern of stress and the

618
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,080
orientation of the of the Mac tributes

619
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,799
so again so we did a number of

620
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,678
experiment to change the pattern of

621
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,558
mechanical stress and see if the micr

622
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,278
tuu would reorient along the new stress

623
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:37,480
pattern so I'm just going to show one

624
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,398
just the simplest one because it's

625
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,120
easier uh so here it's an ablation so we

626
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:45,918
have again a model with the the tension

627
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,319
in the on the top hole we do an oblation

628
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,159
so we predict a circumferential

629
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,319
orientation so it's like in the this

630
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,880
is exactly the same idea and so when we

631
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:56,278
do the experiment so this is which has

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000
been done by Marcus eer so here you have

633
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:02,319
the mabu the cell shape and this is the

634
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,960
mer image you use a UV laser so you burn

635
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,678
two cell one or two cells so this is

636
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,120
what happens right afterwards and then

637
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,880
you let the ma tuu reorient and they

638
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:16,038
reorient circumferentially around the

639
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,520
oblation so of course this is not enough

640
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,158
to fully prove that it's response to

641
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,000
Mechanical stress is wounding there lots

642
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,120
of chemicals that are induced by

643
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,119
wounding but if you do compression you

644
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,519
you see the same and again I mean you

645
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,918
can do over experiment that show that

646
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,639
indeed each time time you change the

647
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,120
stress pattern each time you change the

648
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,320
M orientation also in the

649
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,158
marem so basically what we're saying is

650
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,599
that it's a it's a general rule in a way

651
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,399
so but when you have microt tributes

652
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,359
you're going to change the shape via the

653
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:46,879
effect on cellulose deposition but the

654
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,278
shape itself is going to prescribe a

655
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,559
pattern of mechanical stress that in

656
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:54,359
turn is going to orient the ma tributes

657
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,240
so this is in this case it's uh this

658
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:00,199
feedback loop is a way to uh read tissue

659
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,640
shape so here uh the the the tissue is

660
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,880
able to read the tissue folding at the

661
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,559
marem boundary and amplify the folding

662
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,399
so in this case this feedback loop would

663
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:14,278
help the organ

664
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:16,678
from to move out of the marem domain so

665
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,679
it would like be more quickly separated

666
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,200
physically separated from the mem with

667
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,000
this feedback

668
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,278
loop okay so the problem with the of

669
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,640
course the feedback loop is that uh it's

670
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,240
sort of self um maintained and so you

671
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
could imagine that we've lost the

672
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,038
biology in this because white it's doing

673
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,839
its own thing so you just uh kick first

674
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,000
and then that's it it goes forever and

675
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,240
you don't have to do anything there's no

676
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,640
regulation which I mean can be an

677
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
advantage in biology because you have

678
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,640
less control let's say but I guess in

679
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
biology we usually like to see some

680
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,799
regulation for these things and

681
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
especially because we know that shape

682
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:55,119
can be modulated by the environment or

683
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,359
uh the stage of development so what

684
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,519
could be the regulation for this

685
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:01,278
feedback loop so we've uh started to

686
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:04,918
touch upon this by looking at Regulators

687
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,159
of micu Dynamics and in particular what

688
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,278
we found is that the katanin so the

689
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:13,159
katanin is is a molecular scissors that

690
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:15,159
cuts the macules and increase the macu

691
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,200
Dynamics and what we found is that in a

692
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,480
mutant for the Kine gene or the Kine

693
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,558
protein we have a slower Mac Dynamics

694
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,960
but we also have a slower response to

695
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,359
Mechanical forces so we could imagine

696
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,919
that by playing with katanin activity we

697
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,278
could have a feedback loop that is going

698
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,120
to be more more or less efficient and

699
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,440
then you can imagine that you can modify

700
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,599
or modulate the shape by modulating the

701
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,480
katanin but again playing with this

702
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,839
overall context of the mechanical

703
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,798
feedback loop okay and we found also

704
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,240
some interesting consequences on growth

705
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,960
heterogenity but I'm not going to go

706
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,399
into this detail here another question

707
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,399
we have for this is the mechano

708
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:59,319
transtion pathway so how come I mean how

709
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:01,278
can how can a cell sense tension

710
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,678
so there's a lot of data known I mean

711
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,519
there a lot of data in the animal

712
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,320
systems there are mechano transtion

713
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,200
pathway that are identified in animals

714
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,200
there is formally no or maybe there's

715
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,319
some indication in Plants about mean

716
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,600
transtion Pathways but there's no formal

717
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,158
demonstration of a full mean transtion

718
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,678
pathway in plants so this is an open

719
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,200
area so yeah I'm just going to uh

720
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,840
pinpoint one maybe piece of data to show

721
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
whether what we found is actually making

722
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,918
sense with what we know about the

723
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,000
macules in relation to stress so if you

724
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,278
um what we know is that the macules are

725
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
extremely Dynamic so they polymerize

726
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,679
depolymerize they are cut all the time

727
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,278
and they can also zipper so they can

728
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,240
bundle with one another so this is the

729
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,480
standard situation so mices self

730
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,079
organize constantly and so that that's

731
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,759
the way they can change orientation

732
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,079
quite quickly so now if you put that in

733
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,558
an isotropic

734
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,359
environment well you you might have more

735
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,278
or less a bundling but this is not going

736
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,918
to give you a direction you need

737
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,119
something to bias the the direction so

738
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,720
how can we relate that to tension

739
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,798
there's been some data showing that if

740
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,200
you put the macro tuu under tension

741
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,240
you're going to promote the

742
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,240
polymerization of the macu so the micr

743
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,640
is going to polymerize faster if you put

744
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,120
the micr triu under compression it's

745
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,200
going to depolymerize actually it's

746
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,678
going to deize very very quickly it's

747
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,519
going to go through catastrophe so it's

748
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,080
going to just very quickly you can even

749
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,038
see on mov is in front of your screen

750
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,759
you can see the Mac really going away so

751
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,720
it can be very quick so if you add this

752
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,519
in the mix of the self organization then

753
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,278
it's logic that the maute would align

754
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,679
along the maximal tension right because

755
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,159
you're going to favor the Mac tuu that

756
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,679
are under tension and Destroy if you

757
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,840
want the Mau that are under compression

758
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,278
and and since this is self organized in

759
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,158
a way you're going to have more and more

760
00:29:54,278 --> 00:30:00,200
M bundling in the direction of maximal

761
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:03,399
tension and so this is based on um data

762
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,159
in animal cells also in vitro so it

763
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,719
seems it would be something pretty

764
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,679
General risk response at least it makes

765
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,720
sense that plant cells would have used

766
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,360
this for their

767
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,360
response okay so just to conclude I'm

768
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,319
just going to go back to the animal

769
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,798
world just to expand a little bit on

770
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,599
this so this is um this idea that gene

771
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:26,599
expression can be impacted by mechanical

772
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,599
forces is not new and this is one of the

773
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,398
few examples where people have looked at

774
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,719
this in a multicellular context and this

775
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:37,719
is in in drilo so here what you do what

776
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Emanuel far did was to indent like to

777
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,839
push on an UMO and you can see that this

778
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Gene in green twist is ectopically

779
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:49,240
expressed after this compression so okay

780
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,759
this is very artificial I mean often is

781
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,079
dropil ambrio pushed by micro indentor I

782
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,759
guess not too often in nature but

783
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,359
actually what's what's interesting is

784
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,599
that this Gene is expressed in the

785
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,759
domain

786
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,240
but during gastrulation is experiencing

787
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:06,679
compression so that means that maybe

788
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,638
during Evolution there was there is

789
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,038
tissue movement especially during

790
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,558
gastation actually where you have

791
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,558
patterns again of compression and

792
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,678
tension and this can affect gene

793
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,200
expression so this is in dropil but

794
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,240
actually more recently last year

795
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,600
actually he showed the same thing in

796
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,399
zebra fish and what's spectacular here

797
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,319
is that so here you have the gulation in

798
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:30,439
a drad so the cells are compressed and

799
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:32,079
you induce twist in zebra fish so this

800
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,120
is epiboly so that would be the the

801
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,038
equivalent you also have tissue movement

802
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,479
and you induce no tail which is would be

803
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,720
the equivalent of twist here through the

804
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,759
same mechano transtion pathway so in

805
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,600
this case it's a beta cine pathway so it

806
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,480
it really shows that it might be a very

807
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:51,398
well conserved mechanism in all living

808
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,399
organism or at least we can say in in

809
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:56,719
two fet that are very very distant

810
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,439
between the dril and and the fish and

811
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,880
also what's interesting in this study

812
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,320
and here is really going beyond the

813
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,960
state of the art is uh I mean these

814
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:10,638
genes so twist and noil they are really

815
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,079
critical for mesoderm differentiation

816
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,918
and mesoderm differentiation that's

817
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,638
really big in animal development because

818
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,799
this is like well a lot of things are

819
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:20,599
derived from the the mesoderm people

820
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,000
have been looking for the the molecular

821
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:25,759
que that would trigger meod

822
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,599
differentiation and no one has found the

823
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,720
gene that would really be important for

824
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:32,599
meod differentiation and so what Emanuel

825
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
is proposing is that it's because we

826
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:36,319
haven't found the gene because it's a

827
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,480
force and maybe it's also of course

828
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,158
there are gen involved but the trigger

829
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,079
the triggering event could be this

830
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,519
movement so of course this is like the

831
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,558
next boundary I guess all right so with

832
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,919
that I'll stop here so I have a number

833
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,638
of people to thanks so in the teamon I'm

834
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,278
working with Aris budwood who is a

835
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,879
theoretical

836
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,599
physicist uh I so the work I've showed

837
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,440
was mainly done by Beno Pascal Mi for

838
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,240
the FM and magali wal for the the

839
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,840
katanin experiments we do a lot I mean

840
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,120
we do a little bit on on cell division

841
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,558
with Mario V some modeling and Maria

842
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,038
there some people involved in imaging

843
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,000
here Nat and mati involved in the in the

844
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,440
seple analysis project with Adrian and

845
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,240
Richard so so I haven't talked at all

846
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,480
about the seel I thought we had talked a

847
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,880
lot this week in a workshop so but there

848
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,519
some interesting data coming up soon I

849
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,519
would say from this

850
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,839
Consortium uh the work on payment cell

851
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,440
was done in collaboration with the team

852
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,278
of enrik Johnson and elot movitz and

853
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,960
this overall project actually was

854
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:43,079
initiated by if cair again theoretical

855
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,220
physicist and yantras right thank you

856
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,439
very

857
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,079
[Applause]

858
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,960
much this has been a production of

859
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,960
