1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,480
so as chris said i am a former graduate

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,240
student from cornell and looking back on

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,118
my career those were some of my favorite

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,118
times

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,439
uh the times when i lived in ithaca and

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,320
then up in geneva with harvey hooke as

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
well

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
and um i got married in geneva my wife

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,118
and i got married on the lakefront up in

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,719
geneva and we look back on those times

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,799
as being some of our best friends and

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,879
some of the best times of my life

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,479
so i i just want to say especially to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
the students of you who are there you

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,039
are so fortunate to be attending school

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
at cornell

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,799
it's really a fantastic place

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
okay so

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,718
if you know

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,920
my career at all you probably think of

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,480
me as an aspergillus nebulan geneticist

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
and much of my career i have

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,238
focused on that area i'm looking at

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,159
hyphal growth but i'm actually going to

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,280
tell a different story today because

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,039
i've recently become interested in uh

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,239
particularly kolokos from gram and

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
nicola

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,280
so i am a microscopist and a cell

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,719
biologist and

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,118
um kalatachakum really has amazing cell

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,798
biology it's probably even better than

35
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,478
the raspberry if you're in the field i

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
think kalatocha

37
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,280
there's a lot that can be done with

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,478
polytochmia

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
anyway i'm going to tell you about a

40
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,118
story with canadia the canadial coin

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,680
toss and we can see in this image two

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,000
different canadian depicted

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,159
and i'm trusting that my mouse

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
that i'm moving around here is visible

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
to you all if it's not then please

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,399
somebody yell at me so i can figure out

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,040
how to fix it looks good okay thank you

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,399
and there are two canadians here one of

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,200
them is stationary and therefore i would

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,359
call it attached the other one is not

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
stationary and you can see that because

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,239
subsequent pictures that are depicted in

53
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,399
this are showing a blurring particularly

54
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,478
at the tips of the spore

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,118
and so this is where this concept of the

56
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,478
coin toss comes from is that there is

57
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,719
roughly a 50 50 selection mechanism for

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,879
the attachment of these spores to their

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,878
substrate and so i'm going to tell you

60
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,199
how we got to that conclusion in today's

61
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,199
talk

62
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,318
okay so

63
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,519
as most of you are probably aware call

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,399
it patrick of gram and nicola is an

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,879
ascomycete that causes diseases

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,120
various diseases of corn

67
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,399
um it's one of the top 10 most

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,360
economically relevant fungal pathogens

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,680
it causes foliar lesions on corn plants

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,920
but also is associated with stock rot

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
which causes the lodging of the stalks

72
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,839
and makes it impossible to harvest the

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
corn which is so it's very economically

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
damaging it's one of the greatest

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,439
sources of yield loss among these

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,319
pathogens resulting in tens of millions

77
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,479
of bushels to be lost each year

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,598
and i pulled this image out of a review

79
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,479
article

80
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,079
by

81
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,079
our very own dr breggstrom

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,119
okay so uh my interest is in the early

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
events of

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,400
the production of spores and in sport

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,800
germination and so let's take a brief

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
overview of what happens here um so

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
colitochrome produces two types of

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,120
canadian

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,840
there is a microcanadia that are often

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,759
called ovocanidia in the field

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
that are are not going to be part of

92
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
this talk because they're not part of

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
this mechanism that we talk about

94
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,000
all canadia are thought to be involved

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
in the dispersal of the organism within

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
the plant

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
but the dispersal outside of the plant

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
and to the plant is mediated by the

99
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,119
macro canadia which are also called

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
balcate canadia due to their shape here

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,840
and those are the spores that we see in

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,438
this image

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,438
there are these crescent shapes for

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,438
when the spores germinate

105
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,400
typically you'll see one germ tube

106
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,639
emerge

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
that very quickly under appropriate

108
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,318
conditions very quickly that germ tube

109
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,238
will stop polarized growth and begin to

110
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:15,199
differentiate the infection structure of

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,478
the appressorium as we see in this image

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,199
and then

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,279
it will penetrate its host using a

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,000
melonized aprasoria

115
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,559
using a mechanism that is very similar

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,918
to the better characterized system of

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
magnaporto or pericularia arising so it

118
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,719
uses melanin-derived turgot pressure in

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
order to penetrate

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,680
and sometimes you can get a

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
septation in the spore in order to get

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,918
multiple afresoria forming from the

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
spoon

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
and then once it penetrates the host

125
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,959
you'll get ramification of hyphae

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,439
throughout the maze tissue as we see in

127
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,959
this image where the maze tissue is

128
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,439
stained red in a gfp expressing strand

129
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,279
of colostrum shows us where the hyphy

130
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,319
are growing through

131
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,319
the infected host

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,560
okay several years back i was along with

133
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,719
a grad student a former grad student of

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,079
mine chile wong we uh created a um life

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,960
act strain of palatakam so life act is a

136
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,800
reporter that shows us in live cells the

137
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,638
actin cytoskeleton

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
so these next few images we're going to

139
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
see are showing us of what the behavior

140
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,319
is of the actin cytoskeleton during

141
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,560
these early events of germination

142
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,199
so we see up here a dormant spore

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
pre-germination spore that already has

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,080
this well-defined actin cytoskeletal

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
network running from tip to tip

146
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,478
as the sport germinates and here i'll be

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,319
showing a time lapse and this is sort of

148
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,680
setting the stage for the types of data

149
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,879
that i'll be showing you throughout the

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
talk

151
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,800
this is a time lapse video where a

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
picture is taken approximately once a

153
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,360
minute and then is being played back at

154
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,000
a much faster rate so we're seeing hours

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
and minutes represented in the video

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,360
but in this video we see the germination

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,560
of a felcate spore where the actin

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,319
cytoskeleton is highly polarized

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
um and i'll wait for it to loop back

160
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,240
around again and we can begin from the

161
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
beginning of the sequence

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,519
we have a highly polarized actin

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,120
cytoskeleton in the tip of the german

164
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,120
tube that actin retracts to a septum as

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
the septum is differentiated within the

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,680
spore and then once the septum

167
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,079
is delineated the actin then migrates

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,439
back out to polarize in the growing gym

169
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,240
too

170
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,360
so that's germination

171
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
here now we're going to look at

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,038
afrisorium formation in a similar time

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
lapse these time lapses are

174
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,199
approximately three hours long so the

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
septum has already formed in this time

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
lapse and we now see polarization of the

177
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,038
actin cytoskeleton

178
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,080
that then depolarizes as the germ tube

179
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,959
begins to swell to form an aposorium

180
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,959
and the actin all then relocalizes to

181
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,680
the septation site as a septum

182
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,680
delineates the apersarium from the spore

183
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,079
and then the final

184
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,560
time lapse in this sequence will be

185
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,120
looking at an apricorium from the point

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,598
of septum formation to the point of

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
penetration peg formation so the actin

188
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,759
was localized to the nascent septum the

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
septum forms

190
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,160
actin redistributes into the

191
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,198
appressorium and now it begins to

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,000
localize to the penetration poor as a

193
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
penetration peg begins to form

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
so the point of all this is to show you

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,400
that all of these developmental events

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,360
require the actin cytoskeleton

197
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,159
and likely the trafficking of cellular

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,960
components on the actin cytoskeleton to

199
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,599
these sites of growth as the cell

200
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,598
grows and differentiates

201
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,279
so my uh department just got a new

202
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,959
building about two years ago we moved

203
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,839
into a new building

204
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,598
and along with that new building um some

205
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,318
of us were fortunate enough to get new

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,719
equipment and um i'm no exception to

207
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
that i got a shiny new confocal

208
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
microscope

209
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:22,240
that has all of the bells and whistles

210
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,079
um so if there is a piece of

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,560
technology available on a confocal

212
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,318
microscope it's on this microscope

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
so this has really been a boon for my

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,719
career since moving into this new uh

215
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
building because the types of questions

216
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,519
that i can ask have greatly expanded

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
an example of that here is we see a

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,639
growing hyphy of kolatoch from drama

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
nicola in which we're imaging sites of

220
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,838
endocytosis so each one of these foci

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,679
are actually the sites of endocytosis

222
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,560
and unfortunately i won't be talking

223
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,159
about endocytosis in this talk but that

224
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
has been one of the focal points of my

225
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,559
career for the last 10 years

226
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
um but we have this nice new microscope

227
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,559
that allows us to ask questions with

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,759
even greater detail

229
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,518
than we have done so before

230
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,838
so moments ago when i was talking about

231
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,879
these early events germination i showed

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,200
you a dormant or pre-germination score

233
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,399
of of kalatachan gram and necula this is

234
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
the macrocanadium or sulfate canadian

235
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,679
and it has this pre-formed actin

236
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,399
cytoskeleton that runs from tip to tip

237
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,799
now we noticed that when we uh did the

238
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,559
study five or six years ago

239
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,319
but we were not able to go into any

240
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,559
greater detail of what this preform

241
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,440
cytoskeleton might be doing

242
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,278
and the new microscope has allowed us to

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
take another look at this

244
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,399
and so in this movie here that i'm going

245
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,039
to show you

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,839
this is a z-stack or a three-dimensional

247
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,679
projection of a spore and we're rotating

248
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,640
it so that you can see

249
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,120
that the actin cytoskeleton is actually

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,879
asymmetric within the spore

251
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,799
so it is on one face of the spore not on

252
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,480
the other face of the floor and i have a

253
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,719
visual aid for this

254
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
my visual aid is somewhat comical it's

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
this crunchy banana

256
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,000
but it's essentially a falcate canadian

257
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
and i trust that you all can see this

258
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
somebody please shout at me if you can

259
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
um but in this banana which is

260
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
representing the falcon canadium i've

261
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,639
drawn with a sharpie yeah i can

262
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
cytoskeleton that's on one thing

263
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,720
so in the image we're seeing this four

264
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,879
red heading which is and you're seeing

265
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,879
the actin cytoskeleton which is on just

266
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,559
one face of the floor

267
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,559
so this was the first

268
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,199
when we imaged it this way

269
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,199
is when we realized that maybe there is

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,360
something to this asymmetry so we

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,839
started to look at what could be the

272
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,839
possible function mechanism for this

273
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,839
asymmetry

274
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,599
um next we decided to look at spores as

275
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
they were formed on the petri dish so

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,759
kala tachycam

277
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,480
when grown in on auger will make these

278
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,600
sort of uh erupted pustules out of their

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,240
cerviline that has this buoy matrix in

280
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
which the canadia are secreted into from

281
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
the asservulus

282
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,120
and so what we're looking at here are

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,079
mature spores

284
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,839
within that gui matrix just inverted

285
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:16,719
onto the microscope so that we can see

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
them

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
and i hope you will agree with me that

288
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,759
the predominance of all of these spores

289
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,719
have that actin cytoskeleton already

290
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,399
known

291
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,879
there are a few instances in here like

292
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,440
maybe up here where maybe you would say

293
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,278
the skeleton cytoskeleton is not there

294
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
um but i think that's probably a trick

295
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,159
of the focal point

296
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,519
so the act of cytoskeleton is preformed

297
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,519
on pre-germinations for

298
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,079
uh next we looked at a young developing

299
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,120
a surveillance as it was producing with

300
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,759
canadian

301
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,720
and so in the center of this image we

302
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,919
have um canadia that are being produced

303
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
and are still attached to the

304
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,120
kinetogenous cells giving rise to those

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
spores

306
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,600
and they're revealed with a cell wall

307
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
stain that shows a blue cell wall

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,759
and so all of these nascent canadians

309
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
that are still in the process of being

310
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,120
formed do not have that cytoskeletal

311
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,120
element

312
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,039
but all of the mature canadians that

313
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,799
have been released from these

314
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,719
canadiaogenous cells

315
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,759
do have that pectin cytoskeleton

316
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,200
so production of the actin cytoskeleton

317
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,039
occurs early

318
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
in the development of the spore just

319
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,278
after it is liberated from the

320
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,200
canadiaogen itself

321
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,240
and to verify that claim that i've just

322
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
made

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,039
in this sequence we're going to look at

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,559
a time lapse of a canadium as it is

325
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,879
being produced

326
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,000
so in the image we see the kinetiogenous

327
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,919
cell here

328
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,799
and a young nascent candidium as it's

329
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,360
being produced from that kinetiogen cell

330
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,078
and this image actually has three pains

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,919
we cannot see the gfp channel

332
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,879
at this stage because the gfp is not

333
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,278
being produced so we have gfp we have

334
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,320
transmitted light and then the overlap

335
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,399
and i'll play this image

336
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
so this is at 15 minute intervals for

337
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
several hours and you can see

338
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,639
development of the canadium from that

339
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,039
canadian cell

340
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,759
as it reaches its terminal length it

341
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,838
begins to introduce that curvature

342
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,519
characteristic of the falcate canadia

343
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,120
and we still do not see the act in

344
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,759
cytoskeleton

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,799
but right about now as the canadian is

346
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,639
separated from the canadian cell you'll

347
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,000
start to see that active cytoskeleton

348
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
form up and you can then see the next

349
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
canadian being produced from the

350
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,519
canadiogenous cell

351
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
concomitant with that

352
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,278
so i'll play that again this is kind of

353
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,679
an amazing feat of grad student

354
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,360
ingenuity to get this image

355
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,519
this is the newest grad student in my

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
lab holly vetsel who was able to get

357
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,278
this sequence

358
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,519
of a developing canadian of

359
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,480
kalatosh from gramanicum

360
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
so still no act in cytoskeleton until

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,879
the spore is released from its

362
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,120
kinetiogenous cell and immediately

363
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,559
deposition of that

364
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
point to point

365
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,039
at an array

366
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,039
begins to occur

367
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,439
in this image we are using an inverted

368
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,039
microscope so imagine that my finger is

369
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,920
the lens and we're looking at spores

370
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,480
settling down towards the limit

371
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,198
so we're watching sporus cell

372
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,800
and as this loops through you will see

373
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,639
that some spores attach to the coverslip

374
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,879
immediately this one and this one both

375
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,278
attach the instant they make contact

376
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,838
with the substrate but some spores

377
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,360
remain unattached you can see these

378
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
continuously

379
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
vibrating moving around in a

380
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,159
brownian-like motion because they are

381
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,159
unattached

382
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,159
and so

383
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,759
this is roughly a half and half

384
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,600
situations for attachment

385
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,240
and i hope you can also see that those

386
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,720
spores that are attached have actin

387
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,039
within the focal plane nearest to the

388
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
substrate that we're imaging and those

389
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,360
that are not attached

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,879
lack that acting cytoskeletal element in

391
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,879
the focal plane of an imaging

392
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,240
so when not agitated

393
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,839
we resolve in roughly half of the spores

394
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
attaching to a substrate

395
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,240
and here that is depicted uh numerically

396
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,279
in graph form and this is kind of a

397
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,959
complex graph so i'll go through this

398
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,919
the gray line i'm sorry the um the black

399
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,838
bar graph is showing us the percent of

400
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,838
spores that are attached

401
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,000
over time so zero hours through 15 hours

402
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,920
and you can see that attachment hovers

403
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,799
in the neighborhood of 40 to 50

404
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,559
attachment no matter the time and this

405
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,879
is important that the spores remain

406
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,599
undisturbed in order to see this 50

407
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,159
attachment rate as soon as the spores

408
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,079
are disturbed the percent attached will

409
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,120
change

410
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,519
on the line we see of the percent

411
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
germinated so this is the next concept

412
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,240
that these spores

413
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,519
must be attached in order to germinate

414
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,480
so if the spore is attached then we

415
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,278
achieve germination of the spores

416
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,759
so

417
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,958
at zero time we've got zero germination

418
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,039
but it's up in the 40 to 50 to 60 range

419
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,719
over several hours after the spores

420
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,799
become attached

421
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,839
but with the dotted line here we see

422
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,240
that germination does not occur at all

423
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,560
on any spores that are unattached and

424
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,959
we've left this over the weekend so 48

425
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,198
hours or longer on spores that are

426
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,919
unattached remain unattached if they

427
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,519
were undisturbed they remain unattached

428
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,519
and they remain on germany

429
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,400
okay so more pictorial evidence here

430
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,558
we're looking at the same two spores in

431
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,120
two different focal planes

432
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,359
so the first is the focal plane nearest

433
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,198
the surface

434
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,438
and so you can see that actin

435
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,439
cytoskeletal array running from point to

436
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
point nearest the surface in the

437
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
attached spore

438
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,199
and there's no observable actin

439
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
cytoskeletal array in the unattached

440
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,038
spore

441
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,120
if we go to the top focal plane of that

442
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,119
spore

443
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,199
the same two spores

444
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,599
we have the actin cytoskeletal array

445
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,720
still exists in the unattached spore but

446
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:44,319
it is on the wrong face of the spore

447
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,120
so again i'll use my banana scrunchie as

448
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,119
my

449
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,038
pictorial demonstration just to make

450
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,479
sure we're all on the same page the

451
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,319
sharpie representing the acting

452
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,558
cytoskeleton element

453
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,038
if the spore is on the surface on that

454
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,200
face it's attached but if the

455
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,160
cytoskeletal element is up the spore

456
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
remains unattended

457
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,798
okay um and so here's uh some

458
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:16,399
evidence for that in numeric form

459
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,879
if um a spore is attached then it likely

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,360
has it has the actin cytoskeleton on the

461
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
bottom the rest of the surface the spore

462
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:27,879
is unattached and that organized actin

463
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,879
is at the top of the floor

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,319
and this is uh fully reproducible

465
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,399
and um we do occasionally see attachment

466
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,798
when the actin is at the top and i'll

467
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,798
explain that in a moment there is a

468
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,480
small amount of attachment using another

469
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,639
mechanism that i'll explain when we get

470
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
there

471
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,480
okay so this up led us to make the

472
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,359
proposal of the connection of quantums

473
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,360
and so here is a graphical

474
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,359
representation of one of these fours

475
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,120
and it wasn't until we thought of this

476
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,038
in three dimensions because of our

477
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,038
microscope that can allow us to achieve

478
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,119
three-dimensional imaging

479
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,400
um that we realize that that active

480
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,479
cytoskeleton is cited so in this image

481
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,640
we're looking at the points of the spore

482
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
facing towards us so again my banana

483
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,759
rather than looking at it like this

484
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,759
we're looking at it like this

485
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,640
and when this spore settles through

486
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,400
water these are splash dispersed spores

487
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,080
it's going to settle with the fat face

488
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,038
that's four down and when it hits the

489
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,159
surface it rotates this way or rotates

490
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,400
this way

491
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,960
and depending on the orientation of the

492
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,519
actin cytoskeleton will determine if it

493
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,600
attaches immediately to the surface or

494
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,599
if it never attaches to the surface

495
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,480
okay so digging through the literature

496
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,160
we found a review paper by dr bergstrom

497
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
and nicholson

498
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840
and in that review paper they addressed

499
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,558
some older literature

500
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,480
where the extracellular matrix of colic

501
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,359
hydrogen was addressed

502
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
and

503
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:10,319
so these spores are secret are they're

504
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,640
liberated into a matrix on the um from

505
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,639
the cadiogenous cells

506
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,440
and so we're dealing with this matrix

507
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,440
which is this extracellular matrix

508
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
but also when the spores begin to

509
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,919
germinate they kind of secrete an

510
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,679
adhesive matrix around the germline as

511
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,550
well and i think that that's what's

512
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,759
being dealt with

513
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,000
[Music]

514
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,319
but so it was previously characterized

515
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,038
that the extracellular matrix is

516
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,879
composed of glycoproteins glucans and

517
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,480
amino acids

518
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
and so we scratched our heads a little

519
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,599
bit about how we might be able to

520
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
utilize this information on the

521
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,558
microscope

522
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,400
and that led us to some concanavalion a

523
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,798
which is a lectin

524
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,240
that binds to

525
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,400
glucans

526
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,480
and so this is a protein that binds to

527
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,519
glucans that can be conjugated to a

528
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,679
fluorophore so in this case we used

529
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:07,279
tritc tritzy which is a red fluorophore

530
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,400
and so con a binds to glucan and in this

531
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,480
image we have i'm using three colors so

532
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,038
first of all i'm using a cell wall stain

533
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,960
called solar phenol that stains the cell

534
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,079
wall of blue so we can see the canadia a

535
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
little better

536
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,119
and this is actually a

537
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,599
confocal based fungal cell wall stain

538
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,839
that um harvey hope developed so he was

539
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,439
the originator of the use of this die

540
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,240
that's gaining widespread use in the

541
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
fungal community

542
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
so here we have con a which is binding

543
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,439
to glucans and i hope you'll see that

544
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,120
there is a strip of glucan on the

545
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,919
canadians

546
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,199
and

547
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,919
when we then

548
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,919
with the other channel image life act so

549
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,038
the acting gfp

550
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,960
you can see again our tip to tip

551
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,240
acting cytoskeletal array within the

552
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
canadian

553
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
and then we do the overlay over in this

554
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,279
image

555
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,440
and i hope you will agree with me that

556
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,519
there is a one-to-one correlation

557
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
between the presence of the actin

558
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:10,319
cytoskeletal array and this glucan

559
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,400
binding kane reactive moiety which we

560
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,119
assume is an adhesive

561
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,519
at this stage we assume is an adhesive

562
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,439
and this image i think is just

563
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,279
absolutely dynamite because it shows

564
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,558
spores and all three possible

565
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,480
configurations with actin up actin down

566
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,720
adhesive up adhesive down

567
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,120
and then also the rare occasions when

568
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,720
the geometry of the cell

569
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,959
allows the spore to settle with the

570
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,759
adhesive not in contact with the surface

571
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,919
but also not facing up

572
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,879
but again the point of this is that we

573
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,919
have a glucan moiety associated with the

574
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
active cytoskeleton

575
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,720
and here again is one of these

576
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
three-dimensional images through the

577
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,798
spore and then through the magic of

578
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
computer assistance we're rotating that

579
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,440
three-dimensional projection of the

580
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,720
spore

581
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,519
and again i hope you will see that that

582
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,240
um secreted glucan or the secret the

583
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,440
glucan moiety is uh directly correlated

584
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,798
to the presence of that hacking

585
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
cytoskeleton

586
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,720
so our presumption would be that it's

587
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,558
being secreted by components running on

588
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,919
that actin cytoskeleton

589
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,678
but we have not actually proven that

590
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,919
and just to make sure because sometimes

591
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,480
seeing the video is not immediately

592
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,919
obvious to everyone i've got my banana

593
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,200
and what we're looking at is the spore

594
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
doing this

595
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,519
and now the strip on with a banana

596
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,240
represents both the actin cytoskeleton

597
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:38,000
and that flu can con a reactive moisture

598
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,558
when i showed you the percentages in a

599
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
graph earlier i said that sometimes we

600
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,319
hit numbers that aren't quite fifty

601
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
percent and i think the reasoning for

602
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,918
that is actually revealed in this image

603
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
because the glucan moiety is also

604
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,960
present

605
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,840
at the tips of the spores

606
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,519
and sometimes spores aren't shaped quite

607
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,599
properly they'll be bent like this or

608
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,359
this and however they settle they're

609
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:05,038
always foundation

610
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,918
and so there is a non-coin toss element

611
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,839
to

612
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
selection for adhesion

613
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,079
okay here's another time lapse where

614
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,600
we're watching the spores settle down

615
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,119
towards us on an inverted microscope

616
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,879
and i'll let this play through again and

617
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,879
hopefully pause it in just the right

618
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,880
place

619
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
well

620
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,080
so

621
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
if i could get it paused in the right

622
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,879
place which i don't think i can oh there

623
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,519
we go okay

624
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
um you can see the con a reactive boot

625
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,319
can strip

626
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
it's facing the same direction on those

627
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,759
two spores a and b but as the movie

628
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,840
plays you can see the spores settle in

629
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,599
opposite directions of each other

630
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,119
b is settling

631
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,119
with con a down and the spore attaches

632
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:03,359
and a is settling with the con a

633
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,359
reactive strip up and it does not attach

634
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:13,079
so it's the settling of the spore which

635
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,079
determines whether it will attach or not

636
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,639
okay since this is a glucan our

637
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,640
presumption because con a binds to

638
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,320
glucans our presumption is that this is

639
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,400
a glucan moist

640
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,960
we decided to treat spores with an

641
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,840
enzyme to determine whether that strip

642
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,759
is the actual adhesive element

643
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,319
and so on the left we see what's

644
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,519
familiar to you now this rotation of a

645
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,240
spore

646
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,158
and

647
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,038
it's our control where you can see the

648
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,799
actin cytoskeleton as well as the con a

649
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,640
reactive glucan

650
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,158
reactive strip

651
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,559
and to the right of we have used

652
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,320
enzymes we actually still have a stash

653
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,359
of melvezyme in my lab so that's our

654
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,399
glutenase is noah's not

655
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,038
and you can see that that con a reactive

656
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,278
strip has been removed from the spore

657
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,759
with novazon treatment

658
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,839
and there's some debris in the field and

659
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,319
that's actually very lucky for this

660
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,079
image because it shows us that

661
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,558
um the kane

662
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,079
is actually present in this preparation

663
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,639
because you can see the debris in the

664
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:26,319
background reacting with the

665
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,799
but the strip is entirely removed

666
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,839
so here is further confirmation that the

667
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,400
strip is composed of at least in part of

668
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,399
glucan

669
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,679
and now the image that you see to the

670
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,000
right is of the

671
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
gluconase treated spores

672
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
and i hope what you will see is that

673
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,159
almost all of the spores in this image

674
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
are con attached

675
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,039
so there are rare occasions in here

676
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,798
where spore looks to be immobile like

677
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,759
below this strip that's playing here it

678
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,759
isn't a mobile spore

679
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,558
but for the most part these are all

680
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,640
moving with the flow of liquid inside of

681
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,519
the chamber that we're using here

682
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,360
so no kanas reactive strip

683
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,278
composed of boot cans there's no

684
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,240
attachment and then that's quantified

685
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,079
over here

686
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,640
control is roughly 50 attachment

687
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,038
enzyme treated we get close to zero at

688
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,038
fashion

689
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,159
okay next we wanted to know uh since the

690
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,558
previous study i mentioned before from

691
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,880
bergstrom and nicholson had showed that

692
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:40,158
there is a secreted adhesive from

693
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,720
kalakotram we wanted to know um

694
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
the the timing of the importance of this

695
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,079
con a reactive strip to attachment

696
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,558
and the way to get it that would be to

697
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,480
fix the cells and the data that i'm

698
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,359
showing here are formaldehyde fixed

699
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
cells

700
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,359
so the canadian were treated with

701
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,678
formaldehyde to kill them and then

702
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,439
attachment assays were performed

703
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,440
and in the

704
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,519
it's indistinguishable of the percent

705
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,679
attachment that's achieved um when

706
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,398
formaldehyde is used to kill cells

707
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,798
versus living cells so that to me

708
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,239
indicates that the liberated spores that

709
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,558
we

710
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,000
that we harvested are already attachment

711
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,960
competent

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
so this is not

713
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,600
sorry i got a battery low warning i want

714
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
to make sure i get this thing

715
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,839
plugged in i'm not sure why that would

716
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,839
be

717
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,000
yeah my charger is not working

718
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,278
well hopefully this is gonna

719
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
hopefully i can finish asking for my

720
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,119
battery done

721
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,839
okay um next uh we wanted to see can we

722
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,000
flip spores and cause them to attach

723
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,839
and the answer is yes so what we're

724
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,480
using here is a micro controller

725
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,240
that is controlling a motor that we got

726
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,839
out of an old cell phone

727
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,359
so you're all familiar with turning your

728
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,959
ringer off on your cell phone and

729
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,119
somebody calls you and your cell phone

730
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
vibrates and there's a little motor in

731
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
the phone that does that that we have

732
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,119
attached to a slide here

733
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,240
and it's controlled by a microcontroller

734
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,239
that controls the

735
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,000
length of vibration the time of

736
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,360
vibration as well as the intensity of

737
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,359
the vibration

738
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,839
and in this image what we're going to

739
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,240
see is uh you can see the vibration

740
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,240
happens in the video as it occurs

741
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,480
and if we look across this field you can

742
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,798
see for example here is an unattached

743
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,240
spore that flips over and becomes

744
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,398
attached

745
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,679
here is an unattached spore that doesn't

746
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,519
flip over and it remains unattached

747
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,320
here's an unattached spore that doesn't

748
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,398
flip over it remains unattached

749
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,759
here is an attached spore that remains

750
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,839
attached

751
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,798
but the main the punch line of this

752
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,839
movie

753
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,519
is seeing that spores can flip over and

754
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,480
immediately attach

755
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,480
upon that flipping

756
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,798
sorry i'm entirely distracted by my

757
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,558
charger not working

758
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:28,158
okay um so uh we address this in another

759
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:31,359
way by um pipetting a solution of spores

760
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,200
onto a substrate allowing them to settle

761
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,199
i'm quantifying because we're working

762
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,399
with an inverted microscope quantifying

763
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,038
attachments

764
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,519
and then after various time periods

765
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,879
using the pipettor to agitate the liquid

766
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,119
solution

767
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,520
and so that's what we're seeing here so

768
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,759
no disturbance with a pipettor we've got

769
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,558
roughly 50 attachment as shown with this

770
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,398
gray line here across the board

771
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,000
but if we allow them to settle and then

772
00:30:54,398 --> 00:31:00,079
disturb after five minutes we achieve

773
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,480
much higher percentage attachment 80 to

774
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,398
90 percent attachment

775
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
if we allow them to settle for 10

776
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,479
minutes it remains at roughly 50 percent

777
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
attachment and then 10 minutes of

778
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,599
disturbance you get nearly 100

779
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,839
impressions

780
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,719
and then here is allow them to settle

781
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,439
and

782
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,200
quantify for 15 minutes and we remain at

783
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,440
50 attachment

784
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,759
and then it goes to a high level of

785
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,759
attachment after the disturbance so we

786
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,839
can flip these spores whether we use a

787
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,480
cell phone motor or a pipettor and they

788
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,480
will attach

789
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,960
okay so what does all this mean

790
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,360
we think that the mechanism that we're

791
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,880
seeing here is uh

792
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,558
to enhance the dispersal of the fungus

793
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,278
so if

794
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,759
all spores attached upon initial

795
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,398
settling of the spores then the size of

796
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,038
the infection court would only be as big

797
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,719
as um the rain droplet that settled the

798
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,119
initial spores

799
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,278
we think again this is about uh

800
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,678
dispersal of the spore

801
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,240
so if spores were to settle and all

802
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,519
attach in that rain droplet then um

803
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,159
you're going to be dealing with only

804
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,240
very small lesions at any one time but

805
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
the fact that only some spores will

806
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,120
attach initially then if the spore if

807
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,440
the droplet of water containing spores

808
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,759
runs down the leaf or falls off the leaf

809
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,159
to another leaf or another plant

810
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,960
or maybe a subsequent raindrop splashes

811
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
this

812
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,360
or maybe the rain droplet dries out and

813
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,880
we have some unattached dried out spores

814
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,119
that will then rehydrate and be

815
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,399
dispersed again with a subsequent dew or

816
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,359
rainy pen

817
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:38,639
all of these things can then result in

818
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:41,519
further dispersal of the spores

819
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
um so the this is all about then

820
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,440
dispersal and selection for greater

821
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,479
dispersal we're still working on ways

822
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,880
that we could work quantify this so um

823
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,720
one thing that we've tried is to look at

824
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
coverslips you know i'm kind of a i'm a

825
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,480
benchtop scientist and a microscope

826
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,320
scientist so i think of ways of doing

827
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
this artificially

828
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,519
um so we looked at these long cover

829
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,200
slips

830
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
at various angles

831
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,440
and if we've got a flat cover slip then

832
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,678
we get about 50 attachment if it's

833
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,440
angled slightly so the drop never rolls

834
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,798
and all the spores are more or less

835
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
distributed

836
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,278
in in the initial droplet but if we've

837
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,240
got a greater angle on the coverslip

838
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,159
allow the spores to adhere or to settle

839
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,720
then we get some spores in that initial

840
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,880
droplet and then of course this is kind

841
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,720
of expected i guess but as that droplet

842
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
moves down the coverslip you get

843
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,558
deposition of spores down the coverslip

844
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
as it runs

845
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,000
and so i'm i'm still working on ways to

846
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,080
model this

847
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,919
and um we have done some we've tried to

848
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,319
do this on corn leaves as well but the

849
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,080
microscopy gets exponentially more

850
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,639
difficult to achieve if we try to do

851
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,398
this on corn lanes

852
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,360
so then

853
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:54,158
in conclusion then we've got our uh an

854
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,439
ideal coin toss model that we see here

855
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,159
is now

856
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,159
enhanced by also having the presence of

857
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,679
that adhesive strip

858
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,519
presumably composed of glucans

859
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,038
and so we've got this polarized actin

860
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,358
array that's pre-formed and

861
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,759
pre-germinated canadia

862
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,000
but we know that the production of that

863
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,879
actin array occurs when the spores are

864
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,679
liberated from the canadian itself

865
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,279
the actin array tracks a discrete area

866
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,599
of adhesive

867
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,879
we don't know yet if that actin array

868
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
would be the

869
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,838
distribution network that allows the

870
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,720
secretion of that

871
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,719
adhesive material or is it actually more

872
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,398
of a sensing mechanism

873
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,719
and so i also told you that these spores

874
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:41,199
don't germinate unless they're attached

875
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,439
so the spores must sense in some way

876
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,519
that they have become immobilized

877
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,960
and that actin array may also be

878
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,039
participating in that sensing mechanism

879
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,760
so the initial attachment is passive

880
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,320
that

881
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,320
adhesive is pre-formed and attachment

882
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
occurs instantly upon contact with the

883
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,720
surface

884
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,799
attachment is cited

885
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:08,159
so this likely enhances sport dispersal

886
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,760
um so outstanding questions uh what are

887
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,358
the relationship between the acting and

888
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
the adhesive i've just sort of mentioned

889
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:16,078
this is the act in the distribution

890
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,800
network probably yes but also probably

891
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,880
the actin is as part of the sensory

892
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,640
network associated with

893
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,760
with the spore realizing that it's

894
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,118
become

895
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
immobile

896
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,720
um what's the relationship between this

897
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,400
and the previously characterized

898
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,239
secreted adhesive

899
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
so i have a collaboration with some

900
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,239
physicists that do raman spectroscopy

901
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,079
and we're actually in the process of

902
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,679
using raman spectroscopy to try to

903
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,680
determine what's in the adhesive

904
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
so how does that adhesive of the spore

905
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,119
tips affect coin toss it isn't actually

906
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
perfectly 50 50 attachment and that's

907
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,960
because of the adhesive that we see at

908
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
the tips and that's going to make

909
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,199
modeling of this much more difficult and

910
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,880
i've got a

911
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:01,919
epidemiologist who's helping me

912
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,240
with the conceptualization of this

913
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,720
on the effect of wettability so we've

914
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,358
been using this mostly on coverslips um

915
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,439
we don't know yet the really the effect

916
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,279
of this on a corn plant

917
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,358
and the corn plants have got the the

918
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,800
leaves are going to be waxy because of

919
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,039
the cuticular wax and they're going to

920
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,200
be more hydrophobic and we don't know

921
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,440
yet the effect of that on on this

922
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,480
dispersal mechanism

923
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,159
and

924
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,679
i'm going to play this video this is

925
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,358
really a mystery to us so we've got the

926
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,319
acken array here

927
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:35,039
and this is using the dye fm4 that shows

928
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,960
us a membrane within the cell

929
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,279
and i hope that what you see in this

930
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,838
pre-germinated cell is the dynamic

931
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,000
collapse of that hacking pythoskeleton

932
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,880
and it's actually being achieved by this

933
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,119
membrane bound organelle that is

934
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,000
trafficking on the actin cytoskeleton

935
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,599
almost like pac-man gobbling it up

936
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
and i've shown this to some of my

937
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,559
colleagues at work on actin cytoskeleton

938
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,800
we have yet to come up with a convincing

939
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,639
hypothesis for what that

940
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,320
structure might be that's actually

941
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,759
causing the collapse of the actin

942
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
cytoskeleton

943
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,920
but we do see this

944
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,000
often enough in the cells to know that

945
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
the dynamic collapse of the action is

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,280
actually happening amongst these cell in

947
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,880
pre-germinated cells

948
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,680
and we don't know the mechanism for that

949
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,680
at this time either

950
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,240
okay so finally then i just want to

951
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,720
mention again that my history has come

952
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:29,598
full circle so i was a grad student with

953
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,319
harvey hoke and i used to work on spora

954
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,920
attachment so here's a 1999 paper with

955
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,760
me and harvey

956
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,720
in which we were characterizing an

957
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,280
adhesive sheath on the spores of the

958
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,159
black rod of grape fungus

959
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,640
and i will also point out that this

960
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,879
inquiry took us then to try to look at

961
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,279
calcium signaling

962
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,599
during that spore attachment and we

963
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,640
largely failed at that but i'm pointing

964
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,480
this out because i actually co-authored

965
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,118
a paper with gillian probably gillian

966
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,400
you don't even remember the favor

967
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,640
all the way back in 2001 and um my dear

968
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,480
friend and and departed colleague nick

969
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:13,279
reed was also an author on this paper

970
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,639
okay so with that then i will show you

971
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
that these are the people that actually

972
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,400
did the work of joe vasely as a senior

973
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,960
grad student in my lab who'll be

974
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,200
graduating soon he has a fantastic

975
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
microscopy skills and will be looking

976
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,639
for a postdoc

977
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,679
if anyone up there it needs a

978
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,358
microscopy-oriented postdoc he would be

979
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,199
a good person to do it

980
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,279
um ellen and

981
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,679
hope are two undergraduates to work on

982
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
the project and then ollie up here is

983
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,159
brand new grad student who's going to be

984
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,680
taking over from jail on the project

985
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:49,199
and i think with that then i can end

986
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,199
and ask if there are any questions

987
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:56,319
outstanding job brian thank you so much

988
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,320
and questions

989
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,799
return to my comment

990
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,838
which you missed brian due to your

991
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,599
computer malfunction

992
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:13,519
did you learn more from chris

993
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,838
at michigan state or from harvey

994
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,320
hope while you were

995
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,400
a graduate student here

996
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
don't answer

997
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,920
you know i learned from both of them so

998
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,639
that's unloaded

999
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,119
but

1000
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,199
you know i have focused on microscopy

1001
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,760
for most of my career

1002
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,199
i certainly inherited that phenotype

1003
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
from harvey

1004
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,439
yeah i think

1005
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
my approach to this presentation was a

1006
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,720
very harvey-like approach to the

1007
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,159
presentation

1008
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,598
and um a serious question

1009
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:50,199
uh

1010
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,838
have you stained for dna

1011
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:53,838
[Music]

1012
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,199
in the matrix

1013
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,960
perhaps of those canadian

1014
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,159
uh i have not

1015
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,318
what would you expect to find

1016
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,679
secreted dna

1017
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,719
yeah

1018
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,759
maybe

1019
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,318
okay

1020
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,960
well we have we've tried to use dapi

1021
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,119
because we are hoping to image nuclei as

1022
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,838
this happens to see when mitosis is

1023
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,000
triggered relative to germination

1024
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,078
and daphy doesn't work that well in live

1025
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,079
cells and so really what we would need

1026
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
is a histone marker for that that

1027
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,680
probably wouldn't help us with secreted

1028
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,039
dna i guess dappy probably would work

1029
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,279
with that we could

1030
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,519
i don't think i had that in mind when we

1031
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
looked at those dappy stains for us so i

1032
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:39,440
may not i may have missed it if there

1033
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:41,598
was dna in the secreted matrix

1034
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,800
thanks

1035
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,359
gary

1036
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,160
hey brian i really enjoyed your seminar

1037
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,119
uh your your uh microscopy just blows me

1038
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,000
away

1039
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,880
uh

1040
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,280
i a couple of things i for one thing you

1041
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,599
solved the mystery that for many years

1042
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,319
working with with that organism

1043
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,359
when we're trying to optimize inoculum

1044
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:07,920
production uh we looked for german

1045
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:10,719
ability i.e viability uh using um you

1046
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,000
know watch slides and and looking at

1047
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,879
germination

1048
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,719
uh at six or twelve hours and we're

1049
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,200
always frustrated why couldn't we get

1050
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,279
that germination rate higher so you've

1051
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,159
answered a great mystery there

1052
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,400
uh

1053
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,799
you know when we're trying to achieve

1054
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,559
nearly 100 percent germination we will

1055
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,400
routinely deposit spores and then

1056
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,799
agitate it with the pipeline right and

1057
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,200
then you'll get nearly 100 germination

1058
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,760
yeah it's really that's fundamental

1059
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,598
stuff that's that's amazing a couple of

1060
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,400
things i was thinking about as far as

1061
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,079
some of the implications possibly

1062
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,920
of some of your findings and i agree

1063
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,960
with the dispersal thing

1064
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,039
um

1065
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,760
two things occurred to me

1066
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:55,279
um to enhance the chances for uh stock

1067
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,400
rot infection

1068
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,560
uh enough of the uh the spores need to

1069
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,960
get past the leaf blade and make it down

1070
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,519
behind the leaf sheath to be near the

1071
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
stock grind so you know they don't all

1072
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,880
get bound up on the on the leaf blades

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,280
maybe

1074
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,559
i don't know but maybe that would allow

1075
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,319
for uh

1076
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,318
more of the spores to get in behind the

1077
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,400
leaf sheath

1078
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,199
you know that's just a that's just a

1079
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,000
thought

1080
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,439
um the other thing that occurs to me is

1081
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,838
that ralph nicholson did uh work with uh

1082
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,400
found a germination self-inhibitor

1083
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,480
when uh

1084
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,559
when the uh spores are all crammed

1085
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,440
together in that a servulus

1086
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,880
uh that probably are prevented from

1087
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,240
germinating

1088
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,039
uh but the dilution factor uh the idea

1089
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,318
that you know a clump of spores landing

1090
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,480
in a droplet

1091
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,199
some would adhere and some would be

1092
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,838
allowed to wash off would be a dilution

1093
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,759
factor too uh to kind of dilute out

1094
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,880
whatever germination self-inhibitors

1095
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,640
might be there and that that that's a

1096
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,680
mechanism you might think about a little

1097
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,239
bit too

1098
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,559
going along with dispersal but anyhow it

1099
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,679
was it was fascinating i loved it brian

1100
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,039
thank you

1101
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,440
that's a really good point about the

1102
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,599
self-germination inhibitor being diluted

1103
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,318
as part of this coin toss mechanism as

1104
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,680
well so i i think i want to add that to

1105
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,679
the conceptualization of it

1106
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,239
cathy

1107
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,599
hey brian nice to see you hi good to see

1108
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,719
you

1109
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,680
um i i guess um i always ask impossible

1110
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,279
questions um so i wanted to ask like how

1111
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,919
do you think this is like a kind of

1112
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,599
universal thing like all those fungi

1113
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,760
that have like curved

1114
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,880
spores you expect to find a similar

1115
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,040
mechanism

1116
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,680
i would not be surprised if we saw it

1117
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,559
with other fungi how universal it is i

1118
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,318
don't know

1119
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:53,119
okay um yeah i think that it's um

1120
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:56,318
not outside of uh i don't think it would

1121
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,960
be wild thinking to think that um fungi

1122
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,318
that cause foliar lesions that are water

1123
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,800
dispersed

1124
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,119
might have similar mechanisms and for

1125
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,039
that matter maybe even aquatic fungi we

1126
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,119
think of fungi that you know float down

1127
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,559
a river and get snagged on on leaf

1128
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,480
debris or whatever

1129
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,239
i think anytime there's water dispersal

1130
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,838
that a mechanism like this might be at

1131
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,879
play

1132
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,400
um whether an aerial dispersed fungus

1133
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,400
like you know the fungus i'm used to

1134
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,838
working on aspergillus nebulance i'm i'm

1135
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,039
not sure the mechanism would work

1136
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,799
similarly and i find it's like that

1137
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,279
well it's so interesting and so

1138
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,000
beautiful i love when i love to see the

1139
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,720
sort of living fungus because i usually

1140
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,679
just kill them when i look at them

1141
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:42,078
so thanks for that yeah thank you

1142
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,078
tristan

1143
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,959
hi brian

1144
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,800
hello i really enjoyed your talk and

1145
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,000
your microscopy is absolutely stunning

1146
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
thank you

1147
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,480
i don't know if i might have missed this

1148
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,880
during the talk i was really curious

1149
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,039
so when canadia are being liberated from

1150
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,039
their respective conditional force have

1151
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,199
you been able to observe any patterns

1152
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,119
and how the spores determine where the

1153
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,318
actin initially concentrates whether

1154
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,240
there is a

1155
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,800
factor light or

1156
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,519
initial orientation or is that acting

1157
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,119
concentration more or less random yeah

1158
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,159
that's a great question we've actually

1159
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,920
tried to ask it oh back to my banana

1160
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,719
model my camera is in a different place

1161
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,440
here

1162
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,199
um

1163
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,599
so really what the question is i think

1164
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,439
is is the acting right or left-handed

1165
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,838
right so there is a sidedness to the

1166
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,838
point there's the scar from the canadian

1167
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,078
cell and there's the tip so we can

1168
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,318
distinguish those and we've tried to

1169
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,680
address is the actin always made on one

1170
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,759
side or the other

1171
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,078
and i'm not sure we've convincingly

1172
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,319
addressed it yet but the preliminary

1173
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,480
data we have shows that it can be formed

1174
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,480
on either side but there doesn't seem to

1175
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,199
be a preference of sightedness for which

1176
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,719
side it forms on

1177
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,639
all right

1178
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,159

1179
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,879

1180
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,118
look forward to and let's all thank

1181
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,920
brian again for a really great seminar

1182
