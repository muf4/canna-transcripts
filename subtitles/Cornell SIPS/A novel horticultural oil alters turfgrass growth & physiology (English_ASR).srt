1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,860
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:14,660
well thank you guys I thank you friends

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,239
for for coming it's amazing our semester

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:23,570
has gone by so quickly butts and my

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:25,509
dissertation focus on a horticultural

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,379
mineral oil called civitas and

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,890
horticulture motor oils have been along

9
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:32,390
for a really long time and we sue might

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,030
think why we might just renewed interest

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,070
in studying horticultural oils and it's

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,799
mainly because over the last decade

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,670
we've tried to reduce our chemical

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,229
inputs on to turf grass systems and

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,420
horticultural oils are generally a

16
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,058
non-toxic and they're low threat to the

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,948
environment so companies like

18
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:53,838
petro-canada to develop this product and

19
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:55,969
looking at safer alternatives of

20
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:58,369
commercial traditional pesticides to

21
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:03,109
minimize impact and satisfy Golf Tour

22
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:05,088
demand so kind of a quick seminar

23
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,129
outlines of the today's seminar will do

24
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:09,879
a brief introduction on spray oil

25
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,869
literature which goes back to the 1700s

26
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,019
we'll talk about the Civitas

27
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,228
developments over the last six seven

28
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:20,118
years and discuss some of the many

29
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:22,159
undocumented claims regarding this

30
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,930
product then we'll go into the

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,930
experiments I did where we characterized

32
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,700
response to the Civitas in the in the

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,979
field and then brought it down into the

34
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,649
growth chamber to do some physiological

35
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:36,108
assessments so spray oils have been used

36
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:41,060
in agronomy since the first published

37
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:43,489
article report was from 1787 and it was

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,939
well plant derived oils and then we had

39
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:52,069
the development of crude oil refinery

40
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:53,809
distilling there's an explosion of all

41
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:54,709
these different by process oil people

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,060
trying to figure out what they can do

43
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:00,048
with them and so in 1880 and 1890 cook

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,240
summarized some where people have been

45
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,590
doing looking at putting kerosene on

46
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,608
citrus and firing out that it had

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,890
beneficial effects to prevent insect

48
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:11,419
problems and then it was very common in

49
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,089
in vineyards to actually go out with a

50
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:17,569
25-percent emulsion of crude oil and put

51
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,270
it on apple orchards and vineyards to

52
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,909
help with disease pressure we've come a

53
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,010
long way since then

54
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:28,750
those old compounds are really a big

55
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:30,409
mixture of aromatics and unsaturated

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,129
hydrocarbons that can be kind of nasty

57
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:37,039
Hydra in toxic to plants and people now

58
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:39,379
we've come to these lower aromatic very

59
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,359
saturated compounds with narrow

60
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,009
distillation temperatures which is

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,130
pretty much a paraffinic spray oil that

62
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,750
we have today paraffin is this an older

63
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,159
term for an alkane if you're more used

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,330
to that terminology it's a fully

65
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,939
saturated carbon molecule some of the

66
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,160
consequences of spray oils the first

67
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,799
obvious advantages that we see control

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,669
of insect and insect pests mainly and

69
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,670
now we're actually seeing there

70
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:06,439
something impact on pathogen pass it's

71
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:08,659
got a low environmental impact and low

72
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,009
human toxicity some of the disadvantages

73
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,659
of however are they can they don't

74
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,949
guarantee control sometimes you'll have

75
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,139
breakthrough sometimes you won't have

76
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,369
great control with the products and

77
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,259
there's always a potential for

78
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,659
phytotoxicity even with the most refined

79
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,759
spray oils that we have today so here's

80
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,079
a picture of a conifer that was sprayed

81
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,060
with a dormant application of a spray

82
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,150
oil in the winter it was sprayed too

83
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,849
late it heat the temperature heated it

84
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,890
up and besides some some strong

85
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,689
phytotoxicity and his conifer so it's

86
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,389
common across all different crops that

87
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:43,699
these five boxes you can occur we also

88
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,189
see that these horror orioles are really

89
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:48,439
good spray adjuvant so mixing them with

90
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,750
traditional herbicides insecticides or

91
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,969
fungicides at lower rates we see better

92
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,000
control because these products help to

93
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,739
get the fungus the pesticides into the

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
plant I usually helping to get it

95
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,379
through the cuticle so here's an example

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,739
of a turf grass plot was surrounded by

97
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,239
dollar spot skirtini Romeo carpa then

98
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,409
mixed with a half of the low label the

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,989
rate of a really low impact a fungicide

100
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:18,889
are getting really good control of that

101
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,569
dollar spot disease but fine electricity

102
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,100
can be a problem if you look at the

103
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,418
literature there's kind of two types of

104
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,180
phytotoxicity there's a cute

105
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:29,810
phytotoxicity and that's direct damage

106
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,699
to the leaf so leaf lesions are common

107
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,589
if you have fruit you have sunburn but

108
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,750
really what it comes down to as the

109
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:38,439
membranes themselves

110
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,149
being damaged by these compounds this is

111
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,420
generally more true of the older

112
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,819
chemistry's that had a lot of aromatics

113
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,939
in them and a lot of unsaturated highly

114
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:50,889
reactive hydrocarbons for culture

115
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,350
Orioles today generally classify it as

116
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,569
chronically phytotoxic you see a

117
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,189
decrease in growth decrease in

118
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,480
photosynthesis transpiration and

119
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,969
respiration and this mainly because

120
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,069
because the oil persists on the leaves

121
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,810
and it blocks of stone mates and

122
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,730
inhibits gas exchange and you have all

123
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,649
kinds of feedbacks then that's going to

124
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,600
suppress these processes so now we're

125
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:17,560
generally about civitas it was developed

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,950
in the mid-2000s it's developed from

127
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,519
food grade ISIL paraffins which they

128
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,219
used to make everything from cosmetics

129
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,759
and lubrication to equipment that's used

130
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,550
for food processing I was labeled as a

131
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,099
fungus died in 2009 it also got armory

132
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,329
certified by the organic materials

133
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,090
research institute as a certified

134
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:43,089
organic product so that's great for its

135
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,289
use has limited funds a static activity

136
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,859
and the thing that makes civitas

137
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,210
different at least in the literature

138
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,889
compared to the other horticultural oils

139
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:53,409
is it's been found to induce this

140
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,930
Democrat systemic resistance so

141
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,750
application of this product Prime's

142
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,340
disease are primes genes in the plant

143
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,529
defense pathway so that when a pathogen

144
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:04,929
attacks the plan is really easily

145
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:10,329
quickly to respond to that pathogen

146
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:12,009
attack and suppress up the disease so

147
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,149
why isn't everybody using this product I

148
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,990
mean seems like it's great it's an honor

149
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:19,479
sir to fry product it helps out with all

150
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,790
kinds of myriads of disease issues and

151
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,410
plowed insect pests so there's a lot of

152
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,540
anecdotal claims that came out when the

153
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,610
product was first released the biggest

154
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,990
one was golf course superintendents

155
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,569
thought that their clipping yield on our

156
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,040
putting greens had increased and we know

157
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,480
that an increasing clipping yield can be

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,960
negative on a turf grass health

159
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,790
standpoint because it depletes storage

160
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,949
carbohydrates that could be used to help

161
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,270
recover from stress in the future and

162
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,459
then the other big thing for

163
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,008
superintendents is it reduced ball roll

164
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,709
distance so here's a picture

165
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,569
of a guy measuring ball roll it's a

166
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,848
pretty simple a little device it's just

167
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,499
a stick you lift it up when i get to 20

168
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,449
degrees the ball rolls off and then you

169
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:59,520
see how far it rolls on the green and

170
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,759
well me that although that may seem like

171
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,618
a silly thing that's really important to

172
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,348
golfers golfers associate fastball

173
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:09,119
distances with really nice high quality

174
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:11,908
facilities superintendents try to

175
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:15,110
maximize borrow and limit practices that

176
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:17,308
might somehow hinder ball roll distance

177
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,110
so we wanted this look in the girl

178
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,419
chambers to kind of see is the grass

179
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,189
actually growing faster and we have a

180
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:24,990
time-lapse to kind of show that it

181
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:27,240
appears that there is an increase in a

182
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,098
leaf elongation with the Civitas

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,968
treatment compared to the control it's

184
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,288
not super dramatic but it is seem to be

185
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,569
occurring and we've also mentioned this

186
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:40,378
in the field at putting green high turf

187
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,509
with some time lapse photography finally

188
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,088
the reason people look to this product

189
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,110
is in use that often or struggling to

190
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:48,418
gain acceptance as because it is

191
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,658
phytotoxic to turf and you can see in

192
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:53,848
the top left scripps corner there the

193
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:56,038
Civitas plot it's a little bit hard to

194
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,918
see with it's just projected but it's a

195
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,889
little bit more Brown a little bit less

196
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,468
healthy than the control and so the

197
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,259
company solves this by mixing in a green

198
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:09,538
pigment to have just paint the grass

199
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,229
green and so that really helps to

200
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,718
minimize that that problem so the onset

201
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:16,949
we had a lot of different questions and

202
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,959
it was really difficult to figure out

203
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:20,848
how exactly we're going to proceed i

204
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:25,769
came here lies different energy total

205
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:27,389
claims look at disco and i need to try

206
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:29,879
to figure out some kind of ways to link

207
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,219
all these different responses into my

208
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,129
dissertation that's okay here's a

209
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,019
roadmap now if I've gone through about

210
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,370
probably 15 different experiments in the

211
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,908
field in the growth chamber in the

212
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,839
greenhouse over the last six months have

213
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,639
been finally able to take those

214
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,130
experiments and try to make sense of all

215
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,409
these different results so we first

216
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,789
quantified the response of civitas in

217
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,559
the field by measuring ball roll

218
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,929
clipping yield and surface

219
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,419
characteristics like density and canopy

220
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,479
temperature on a fairly regular basis

221
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:01,490
then once you got a good sense of

222
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,190
going on in the field we were able to go

223
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,589
into a growth chamber look at

224
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,870
phytotoxicity and try to understand it's

225
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,490
a direct damage with for an acute final

226
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,328
toxicity or is it more of a chronic

227
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,490
damage then we expanded upon that

228
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:18,289
looking at gas exchange because most of

229
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,329
these modern oils have been found to

230
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,759
inhibit gas exchange info synthesis and

231
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:24,919
then finally if you're inhibiting gas

232
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,519
exchange what was that due to the carbon

233
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:30,740
dynamics of turfgrass plant so the in

234
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,320
the in my second chapter of my

235
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,639
dissertation the quantifying just the

236
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,230
equipping yield and the ball roll

237
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,820
distance now was the main objective it's

238
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,190
just kind of looking at equipping yield

239
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,230
and ball roll for ten days after we

240
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,630
applied the product we measured it every

241
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,610
single day I knew you'd at six times

242
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:47,870
over the course of two seasons then we

243
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,399
also want to look at some kind of

244
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,198
mitigation strategy if there is an

245
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,149
increase in ball roll so that this

246
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:55,490
product can gain acceptance in the in

247
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,070
the field our hypothesis was that

248
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,019
borrowed decrease was he in the field

249
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,850
was inversely related to the increase in

250
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,919
clipping yield with civitas and we were

251
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,959
hoping that the plant growth regulator

252
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,719
trinette sepak ethyl which is commonly

253
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:11,838
used to inhibit cell elongation might

254
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,949
actually mitigate that the client so all

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,019
these field experiments I'll just kind

256
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:17,750
of set them up here they've done a

257
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:19,459
bluegrass laying on a bed grass annual

258
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,220
bluegrass putting green and they are

259
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:24,109
maintained of standard practices so in

260
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,000
the clipping yield response study again

261
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,579
we had six ten day runs reflected

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,990
clippings every day and we had to

263
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:31,669
evaluate the different components of

264
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,259
civitas individually to try to get a

265
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:35,659
better sense of what's going on so we

266
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,939
have a control we have the Civitas soil

267
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:40,458
by itself the harmonizer oil with

268
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,319
pigment by itself then the mix of the

269
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,789
two which the company and is preferred

270
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:45,948
to industry is the 2-pack because you

271
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:48,799
mix it on site and then recently the

272
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:52,429
company Patrick Hannah developed civitas

273
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,139
one which is mixed at the factory it has

274
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,399
a different emulsifier so it does have a

275
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,919
little bit different prop research will

276
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,328
see the ball roll measurement then kind

277
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,568
of mirrored the clipping yields is just

278
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:04,939
done a separate separate putting green

279
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:06,349
and we looked at Bartle distanced over

280
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,959
the course of the day and then across a

281
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,300
10-6 10-day runs and we limited the

282
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,079
treatments here to just the control the

283
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,689
2-pack

284
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,310
the one pack steve has one and then with

285
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,670
them without this growth regular a trick

286
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:22,039
to exit pack FL which it introduces tank

287
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:25,610
grill so he's kind of a look at what

288
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,500
looks like in the field the Civitas and

289
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,990
then the 2-pack mixing the two together

290
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,659
and then the control and then har

291
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,580
manager by itself for Suffolk whipping

292
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,230
yield we found that everything that

293
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,930
every time we applied oil we had an

294
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,340
increase in clipping you whereas the

295
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,319
harm riser did increase clipping yield

296
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,870
and the control obviously as a control

297
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,190
there's two hypotheses here first it's

298
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,679
growing faster that's why there's more

299
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,270
clip clipping yield and that's kind of

300
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,819
supported by our time lapse measurements

301
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,559
the other hypotheses though is that the

302
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,660
oil itself may be contributing to the

303
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,049
weight of the leaves we'd only talking

304
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:02,299
about you know milligrams of tissue

305
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,669
difference here and so that's definitely

306
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,769
a possibility we think it's probably

307
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:08,240
some combination of both of them now

308
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,730
some of the oil has gotten down into the

309
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,500
canopy into the verdure and so not all

310
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,240
of it stuck on the word that's actually

311
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,129
being clipped but it's hard to actually

312
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,009
just say that the equipping yield

313
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:22,490
increase is only a fact of increased

314
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:25,100
growth rate so we looked at ball roll

315
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,860
distance and we saw that in fact the

316
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,870
ball roll distances did decline with the

317
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,050
Civitas to pack and even more with the

318
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,850
Civitas one pack these are practically

319
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:37,969
significant differences and Sicily civ

320
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,399
second differences so this is a level

321
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,470
that may not be acceptable to Gulf to

322
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,740
call for superintendents in the golfing

323
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,220
public it lasted for all ten days we see

324
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,139
an increase in ball rolls that each run

325
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,580
progressed because the the plots were

326
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,049
rolled and so as we were rolling in

327
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,490
every single day we increase surface

328
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:59,000
uniformly in the ball would roll farther

329
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,919
unfortunately there's no interaction

330
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,509
with the plant growth regulator and the

331
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,219
growth regulator only increased ball

332
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,600
roll by about seven centimeters which is

333
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,430
an even significant or practically

334
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,230
significant in the field golfers can't

335
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,629
perceive that small of an increase so

336
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,250
the growth regulator didn't help out

337
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:18,409
either although it did counter the

338
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,940
growth increase with the Civitas but so

339
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,319
if you look at this data and look at the

340
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,470
clipping yield data from the previous

341
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,930
slide you would then still assume that

342
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,840
as you had more clipping yield you're

343
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:30,969
going to have slower ball roll distances

344
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,879
so we did a correlation to see it as is

345
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,860
in fact the case we found out it doesn't

346
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,720
it's not true at all this has been

347
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,269
combined across all different days but

348
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,370
it was also done for each sing each day

349
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,500
each measurement within a day on each

350
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,019
run and there's only like handful of

351
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,669
occasions where there is a a correlation

352
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,470
of clipping yield and ball roll distance

353
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:52,269
and so this is important because

354
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,399
literature suggests that bottle distance

355
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,139
is correlated with clipping yield but

356
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,110
they never actually do correlations they

357
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,519
look at clipping yield and or and then

358
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,289
they look it'll use a product that looks

359
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,149
at it will put fertilizer down they'll

360
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,469
see the grass grows faster they'll see

361
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,240
the ball roll goes down and then I just

362
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,620
assume that oh the ball roll when town

363
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,879
because the grass grew faster but they

364
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,220
never actually did the correlations to

365
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:13,809
prove that and so I think there's some

366
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,639
some work that could be done there to

367
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,079
better understand this because there's

368
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,179
got to be some other factors high for a

369
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,940
lethal long Gatien as influencing ball

370
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,259
roll if it's the leaf of fiction the

371
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,030
firmness of the surface something we

372
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:26,799
need to figure out more and it so it's

373
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:30,519
so essential to management of the golf

374
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,049
courses quick conclusions civitas

375
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,079
increased clipping yield which is has

376
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:37,259
made potential implications for reducing

377
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,740
carbohydrate levels in the plant

378
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:43,450
borrowed the increased civitas did

379
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,600
reduce the bar role which could be a

380
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,860
problem for high-end putting surfaces in

381
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,409
their plant growth regulators just

382
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,330
didn't have enough enough of an effect

383
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:55,179
to really cancel out that that decline

384
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,610
of oral distance with civitas so then we

385
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:59,889
looked at the chronic phytotoxicity of a

386
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,960
civitas by first characterizing in the

387
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,000
field and then isolating the cause in

388
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,930
the growth chamber and we hypothesized

389
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,789
due to the nature of this oil that

390
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:11,079
civitas will reduce gas exchange which

391
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,939
is going to cause a chronic

392
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,600
phytotoxicity and that the harmonizer

393
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,940
mask this effect in the field so what we

394
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,290
did is we had another study at bluegrass

395
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,240
lay on the same putting greens to

396
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,669
describe previously and we had a

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,279
factorial 2 by 2 factorial we have

398
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:30,219
civitas the control and civitas and then

399
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,769
the oil by itself and then the oil and

400
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,199
the Civitas

401
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:36,409
the pigment by itself and the oil and

402
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,818
the pigment together and did turfgrass

403
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,588
quality rating which is kind of looks at

404
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:41,599
the uniformity of the surface the collar

405
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,160
of the density is very much subjective

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,159
but it's also very repeatable at the

407
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,678
same time we looked at chlorophyll index

408
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,838
with the CM 1000 to get a sense of the

409
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:53,568
amount of chlorophyll in the leaves and

410
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,559
campy temperature with a FLIR camera and

411
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,568
then at the end of the study we did

412
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,438
Taylor density counts so you're just

413
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:59,208
kind of a picture what this

414
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:01,428
phytotoxicity looks like at the end of

415
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,948
this growing season you'll notice the

416
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,058
control it looks a little thin it's at

417
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,698
the end of the growing season has been

418
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:09,678
warm the pole annual annual bluegrass is

419
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:12,318
starting to our be stressed out put the

420
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:14,028
home run that pigmentation really helps

421
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,009
surface look a lot better and I also

422
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:18,619
suspect that it actually helps the plant

423
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:21,470
to cope with some of the light stress

424
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:25,009
during the summertime the Civitas then

425
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:28,790
had the typical parodic appearance some

426
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:30,558
general thinning going on so starting to

427
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,738
have a decrease in quality and the

428
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:36,438
2-pack again had that same thinning but

429
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:39,170
then it's just still just painted green

430
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:40,818
with this harmonizer and so where the

431
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:44,719
grass did that I was very obvious by

432
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:46,969
these little flecks of blue so we look

433
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,230
more specifically at how a change over

434
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,540
the course of the year so we looked at

435
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,278
canopy temperature with a FLIR camera

436
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,379
and you can clearly see where the

437
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,659
controls out control plots are versus

438
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:59,119
the pigment and the oil and the mixture

439
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:01,219
of the two we did find that there's an

440
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:03,410
increase in temperature with the oil and

441
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,610
the pigment which you may expect and it

442
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,318
was definitely a function of solar

443
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,869
radiation so when it's sunny or out

444
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,298
there's a lot of differences if it was

445
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,739
cloudy or raining or cool generally

446
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,750
there is no differences between

447
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,578
treatments and all this may seem

448
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,619
significant the Kami temperature

449
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,259
increase is only an average half a

450
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,879
degree warmer with civitas and one

451
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:25,158
degree warmer civitas plus the the

452
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,399
pigment and even on the sunniest how to

453
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:32,360
stay in the summer that the increase was

454
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:34,308
only two degrees C so it really may not

455
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:38,658
be that and physiologically important to

456
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:40,038
have that small increase but it is as it

457
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:42,980
does suggest there may be something

458
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:46,579
going on like reduced transpiration

459
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:51,250
with the oil finally the final toxicity

460
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:56,178
with the quality this bottom line here

461
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:58,160
but this dash red is the Civitas and you

462
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,080
can see in the first year it was below

463
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,169
acceptable acceptable level of six for a

464
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,329
majority of the summer of the year

465
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:07,669
whereas the pigments civitas the solid

466
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:10,069
red line was at or above the level to

467
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:14,509
control the entire time the interesting

468
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:16,548
thing in 2013 was the civet the 2-pack

469
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,169
declined at the end of the year to a

470
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:19,160
level that was unacceptable and you saw

471
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,320
that in the last picture with the

472
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,330
thinning of the grass so thy policies is

473
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,759
this this humm rash was actually just

474
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:28,759
more masking this file toxicity because

475
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,859
in 2012 we didn't have the thinning we

476
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,589
had the chlorosis which was masked by

477
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:35,619
the harmonizer but then 2013 we had the

478
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,569
chlorosis and then the eventual

479
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:42,819
declining density which then obviously

480
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:42,819
can't be masked by a green pigment yeah

481
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:52,970
they're playing every two weeks yep at

482
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,099
the end of the study 32 density counts

483
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,380
and we found that we did definite the

484
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:00,349
climbing in stand density number of

485
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,600
tillers with the Civitas and the 2-pack

486
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,909
treatment compared to the control and

487
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,769
the hymen answer so this definitely is

488
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,019
some definite phytotoxicity happening

489
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,970
here and we wanted to figure out why is

490
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:13,970
this happening what caused this fire

491
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,220
toxicity with some implications of

492
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,259
reduced gas exchange with an increase in

493
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,539
temperature then how would that affect

494
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,839
photosynthesis and respiration and how

495
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,428
that affects carbohydrate pools so we

496
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,079
then went to the growth steam growth

497
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,880
chambers in wild hall for the rest of my

498
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,529
experiments will be discussing just to

499
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,730
kind of get it set up all the change all

500
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,109
the experiments happen in the same

501
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,460
environmental conditions unless they

502
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:40,969
were otherwise noted 30 degrees c during

503
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,460
a day 20 degrees c at night about 500

504
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,200
micro moles of for synthetic active

505
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,200
radiation per meter squared per second

506
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,230
for 16 hours and then we establish these

507
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,269
clones of annual bluegrass for three

508
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,769
months and once they were done stand

509
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,960
looking like this then expiry

510
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:59,960
happened and they were fertilized weekly

511
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,029
with a lower area nitrogen so

512
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,559
understanding phytotoxicity is a bunch

513
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,899
of small little experiments so we'll

514
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,250
just kind of go through these quickly we

515
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,360
look first at membrane disruption

516
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,609
because that's a sign of acute

517
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,990
phytotoxicity and to measure that we

518
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,519
just looked at electrolyte leakage and

519
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,259
we found that there was no treatment

520
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,240
differences relative to the control

521
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:19,700
which is good showing and get that in

522
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,470
fact these civitas isn't acutely

523
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,200
phytotoxic it doesn't damage the plan

524
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,690
anyway interestingly there was an

525
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,430
increase or decrease in electrolyte

526
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,170
leakage with the pigment although all

527
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,820
the values are really really minimal

528
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,730
which would suggest that the plants were

529
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:35,509
healthy and I believe we can explain

530
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,529
that because when you measure

531
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:41,119
electrolyte leakage you measure the

532
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,460
electrical electrical conductivity of

533
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,649
water it's got tissues floating in it

534
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,240
for 24 hours then you auto plate that

535
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,440
tissue you measure it again to see what

536
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,359
the potential amount of ultra

537
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,509
conductivity can be and I think what

538
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:56,419
happens is the pigment with this huge

539
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,879
chelate copper compound it probably

540
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,590
drops that that copper out so then it

541
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,990
increases the denominator of the

542
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:04,369
equation and dilutes the the luck slight

543
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,980
leakage number just because you're

544
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:11,239
losing the chelation of that copper ion

545
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,789
next let's look at scanning electron

546
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,680
microscopy of some turf grass leaves

547
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,379
treated with civitas 24 hours after

548
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,850
application and then again 48 hours

549
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,890
after application after a second

550
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:23,839
application of the product and we find

551
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,060
that there's some definite signs of

552
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,740
change in the morphology of the cuticle

553
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,990
where we have these nice platelets in

554
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:35,359
the control that degrades down and

555
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,670
becomes more flat we see oil persisting

556
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,799
on the stomata which may affect gas

557
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:44,750
exchange and actually may be beneficial

558
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:49,009
to pesticide absorption so we see that

559
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,809
the cuticle is it's being modified and

560
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,670
morphology wanted to verify that it

561
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,769
wasn't changing in quantity or

562
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,360
composition so we extracted the cuticle

563
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,119
off of leads treated with the five

564
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:02,809
different formulations of our parts of

565
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,819
SIP components of civitas and we found

566
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,490
in

567
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:09,309
at the top total iron chromatograph

568
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,769
these represent a lot of the waxy

569
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:13,659
components so you have some fatty acids

570
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:17,650
and then these are all primary alcohols

571
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,529
ranging from 22 to 28 carbons the

572
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:24,040
predominant one was a c-26 primary

573
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:26,529
alcohol hexic Olson all and that level

574
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,220
didn't then change with our response to

575
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:32,710
the Civitas there was however a really

576
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:36,640
pronounced civitas signature that was

577
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:39,039
found on all the pole ion chromatograms

578
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,290
from the GCMs and when we look at it

579
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,710
from a mole to mole ratio of total moles

580
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,450
of civitas versus the total mole of the

581
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:49,380
one hexa coulson all we find out this

582
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,150
between nine and 17 times the amount of

583
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,030
waxy oil substance on these cuticles and

584
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,690
there would be if they were just if

585
00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:00,190
their natural and not treated finally we

586
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,039
did some gas exchange measurements with

587
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,470
a like or chamber it's gotten a rabid

588
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,539
opsys set up so we can drop our cohen

589
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,140
right in there and adjust the the light

590
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:14,680
intensity and make light response curves

591
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,440
and ACI curves really simply to look at

592
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:21,150
photosynthesis and respiration and what

593
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,090
we found was that civitas reduced met

594
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,700
radiation use efficiencies the the

595
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:30,730
Civitas one the blue line was uh was

596
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,710
more injurious than the Civitas to pack

597
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,110
our CEO tossed by itself and the pigment

598
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,890
had no effect this is only done 24 hours

599
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:41,679
after application and so we had to we

600
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:47,140
repeated this experiment to get a better

601
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:50,440
sense of how gas ian is being affected

602
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,380
but just looking at 50 toxicity we've

603
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,740
determined that acute file toxicity did

604
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,870
not occur and the wax at the cubicle wax

605
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,140
composition and content that was

606
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:04,209
unchanged but then there were some signs

607
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,650
of chronic phytotoxicity resulting from

608
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,230
that persistence of the oil which is

609
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,580
inhibiting gas exchange but more

610
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,950
research is required to figure out how

611
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,429
long does that actually last how bad is

612
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,500
it

613
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,720
so we designed the next chapter of a

614
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,180
thesis dissertation to look at how

615
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,900
civitas reduces gas exchange and so this

616
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:26,500
is this a lot higher a larger level of

617
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,580
measurements so these gas exchange

618
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,400
systems are really great because they're

619
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:34,279
super powerful and you can make carbon

620
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,060
assimilation or transpiration response

621
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:41,869
curves to factors such as photon flux

622
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:45,710
flux gradients which is Q or ambient co2

623
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:47,359
or internal co2 CA and CI because I'm

624
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,789
doing canopy level things I have to do

625
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,519
CA I can actually calculate CI because

626
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,559
of the can't measure individual leaf of

627
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,089
turfgrass you can also look at under

628
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,859
different vapor pressure gradients and

629
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:59,959
then from those models we can estimate

630
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:03,799
things like quantum yield rubisco

631
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,680
activity and respiration so hard lady

632
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:09,649
how do these devices actually work

633
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,450
here's just kind of a a graph of a light

634
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,940
response curve that I did I made my

635
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,309
stability be kind of quick so I can fit

636
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,080
it in the course of ten minutes but what

637
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,450
happens here on the x-axis you have the

638
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:23,089
time and then for synthesis and

639
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:26,500
transpiration on the y-axis and so the

640
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:29,629
process the fungus put in it's at 500

641
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,700
power and then once that stabilizes the

642
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,540
Machine automatically increases light

643
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:38,299
intensity two to a 2000 and then it

644
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:40,639
responds the once it comes into a stable

645
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,789
level which I defined and then here's it

646
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,040
wasn't entirely stable for this example

647
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,230
then the machine proceeds to reduce the

648
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,750
light levels or in the case of a CI curb

649
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:55,400
reduce the level of carbon dioxide in

650
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:57,349
the inmate chamber to measure folk

651
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,640
synthesis and then we can plot all those

652
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,889
those points where it makes a

653
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,210
measurement and we get these great late

654
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,759
response curves it tell us a lot of

655
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,309
interesting things the I y-intercept

656
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:11,569
talks about the maximum rate of

657
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:13,669
respiration like compensation point that

658
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:15,500
initial slope represents quantum yield

659
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,250
or the amount of carbon dioxide

660
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,559
molecules fix per photon then the

661
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,539
plateau represents the maximum posted

662
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,490
that capacity of that plant and that the

663
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:28,700
K as a result of either gay

664
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:33,349
diffusion inhibition or are you a BP

665
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:35,179
regeneration of limitations and in the

666
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,589
previous experiment were we showed the

667
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,710
late response courage this did a simple

668
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:41,839
anova and these experiments we used

669
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,110
regression analysis and so we salt been

670
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,849
able to then do regression and solve for

671
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:52,189
respiration the a max term and the

672
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:54,019
apparent quantum efficiencies the earth

673
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:58,429
the great thing too is we can look at

674
00:26:54,019 --> 00:27:00,379
the transpiration rate and because

675
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,120
transpiration is a factor of leaf

676
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,030
conductance times the vapor pressure

677
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,558
deficit which we have we can fix with

678
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:10,279
the like or we can assume that

679
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:13,009
transpiration rate and leaf conductance

680
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,859
are a good proxy for each other on their

681
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:19,429
pre proportional and that can get to our

682
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:21,319
questions about the model inhibition so

683
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,150
we did to experiment we did one

684
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,389
experiment where you put a cone in the

685
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,950
like or they made in a huge curve at

686
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,929
different light intensities and then

687
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,819
right after that it went to an AC a

688
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,860
curve at different levels of carbon

689
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:36,379
dioxide with a constant relative

690
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:38,000
humidity and light level for the carbon

691
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,160
dioxide so we can have one vapor

692
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,950
pressure deficit value to them make

693
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,019
those comparisons on leaf conductance we

694
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,779
measured this when the control the

695
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:49,910
Civitas one and a civitas three hours

696
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,519
one two five and ten days after we

697
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,610
applied the products so what we do is we

698
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,589
get these big time courses where we have

699
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,229
three hours to ten days and then we

700
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:02,299
replicated our runs twice and so you'll

701
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,620
notice that for all these treatments

702
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:06,230
there was never a difference in

703
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:08,839
respiration so the Civitas dint affect

704
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,808
respiration but it did affect the a max

705
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:16,099
levels which then also means it affects

706
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:18,920
the quantum yield of the plant and in

707
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:21,230
two thousand in run one we had more

708
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,808
suppression of a max and run to and that

709
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,039
was a factor of a misapplication and a

710
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:28,160
little bit higher rate because the

711
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,460
nozzle was too close to the via the

712
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,080
campy leaves and so I got a little bit

713
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,460
higher rate and so it definitely showed

714
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,659
it there's a rate response and I've done

715
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,319
some experiments to show there as a

716
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,230
linear

717
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,428
responds with a max values but kind of

718
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,528
this to summarize what this shows is

719
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:46,590
definitely of an eat the decrease in

720
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:48,419
radiation use efficiency and respiration

721
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:50,879
wasn't affected and it takes ten days at

722
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,299
least for this effect to start to wear

723
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,309
off transpiration from that same study

724
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,548
again we have photon flux density on the

725
00:28:56,308 --> 00:29:01,950
bottom there was a no interaction so as

726
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:03,538
we had brighter light intensity we saw

727
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,360
an increase in transpiration which makes

728
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:10,619
sense from a mass balance standpoint but

729
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:13,199
the Civitas had higher levels of or had

730
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:16,168
lower levels lower intercepts showing

731
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,669
that there's less transpiration and it

732
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:20,519
wasn't as dramatic about the client is

733
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:23,490
the light response measurements the

734
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,069
assimilation measurements and usually

735
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,079
recover within 24-48 hours by 48 hours

736
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:30,528
you can see that the transpiration race

737
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:34,109
it came back to the level of the control

738
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:36,179
which is interesting and then finally

739
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,638
bit look at the the ACA curves and this

740
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,740
kind of looks at the kinetics of rubisco

741
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:43,138
activity and carboxylation efficiency of

742
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,298
the plant so the initial slope

743
00:29:43,138 --> 00:29:48,148
represents the initial carboxylation

744
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:52,829
efficiency of the plant and then the

745
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:54,298
y-intercepts represent the respiration

746
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,339
rate and they'll notice first of all

747
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:57,720
respiration rate was different it's a

748
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:01,138
little bit lower with the Civitas

749
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,548
treatment and that results from for an

750
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:03,778
increase in photorespiration because

751
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:06,839
these are all at the same light

752
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:11,250
intensity of 400 or 500 micro moles of

753
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:13,288
power and so this this data kind of

754
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,119
represent indicates that is reduced

755
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:18,119
carboxylation efficiency and increase

756
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:21,359
for rest for respiration and we know

757
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,969
that when you have a decrease in gas

758
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,798
exchange that activity of rubisco

759
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,690
declines because we're busy takes a lot

760
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,388
of energy to keep or bisco in an active

761
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,669
state especially if it's limited for its

762
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:36,000
substrate and these curves suggest that

763
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:39,090
the the plants are substrate carbon

764
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,558
dioxide limited and therefore they have

765
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:47,819
a decline in in roble activity and then

766
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,960
finally looked at gas exchange carbon

767
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,589
assimilation as a function of

768
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,860
transpiration rate which is the proc

769
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:56,769
see you again for for gas exchange and

770
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:59,558
leaf conductance and we find with the

771
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:04,329
Civitas one that there is a really

772
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:07,119
strong increase in cart in folsom nas's

773
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,579
back to kind of level of the control as

774
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,129
we had higher transpiration rate so this

775
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:14,230
could suggest directly that some model

776
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,500
conductance is actually was inhibiting

777
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,690
this for this carbon assimilation right

778
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,679
the Civitas itself a little bit less

779
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:25,149
which makes sense because that's

780
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,788
reflected back on the the light response

781
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:30,038
assimilation curves another thing to

782
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:31,960
note to is after this this initial part

783
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,569
where it's really linear or fairly

784
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,308
linear that occurred early after we

785
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:40,509
applied and then later on after we

786
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:42,759
applied the Civitas it came back to be

787
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:45,429
less of a function of transpiration rate

788
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,000
so that suggests that it's an inability

789
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:52,990
of the plan to utilize all the carbon is

790
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,058
taking in from the from transpiration

791
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,308
from gas exchange again suggesting that

792
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:59,619
rubisco is probably somehow inhibited

793
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:03,389
through some kind of inactivation later

794
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:05,729
on into the each run so the conclusions

795
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,720
civitas definitely reduced carbon

796
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,788
radiation use efficiencies and

797
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,880
transpiration gas exchange for a period

798
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:14,829
of 10 days and the carboxylation

799
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,230
efficiencies were definitely reduced as

800
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:20,379
a as a function of that decline in gas

801
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,360
exchange measurement so then it leads to

802
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,799
our final questions is so okay now we

803
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,658
know is less full sentences have

804
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:27,519
occurring less assimilation of carbon

805
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:30,278
what's happening to the partitioning of

806
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,079
carbon and then my question would be you

807
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,109
know where's this reduction in gas

808
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,898
exchange have effect on oxidative stress

809
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:40,028
in the plant so the final chapter of my

810
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:41,918
dissertation we looked at civitas

811
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:44,980
altering carbon dynamics we measure

812
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,538
plant biomass partitioning and the

813
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,880
measure concentration of storage

814
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:51,158
carbohydrates this experiment was

815
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,750
designed to simulate stressful

816
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,770
conditions so it's under really high

817
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,298
light intensities in that partly because

818
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:59,859
we find that as light intensity

819
00:32:58,298 --> 00:33:02,400
increases is a bigger disparity between

820
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:05,529
the Civitas level and

821
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,910
the control for carbon assimilation so

822
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:09,549
that way we kind of exacerbating it's

823
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,529
definitely a worst term a worst-case

824
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:15,879
scenario additionally it led to some

825
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:17,649
episodic daily water stress so we kind

826
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,390
of could evaluate how civitas affects

827
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,070
plant stress how much does something

828
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:24,820
that's marketed a lot that is useful in

829
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:26,740
helping plant health so we re applied

830
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,869
civitas and wilt stop a commercial

831
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,049
transplant I transparent biweekly and

832
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:33,429
then measured carbon partitioning and

833
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,109
quality and gas exchange over the course

834
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:38,500
of eight weeks to get a sense of how

835
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:41,649
carbon perdition is changing so first we

836
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,210
did confirm that the Civitas and the

837
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,680
will stop reduced carbon assimilation

838
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:50,230
and transpiration goodbye about you know

839
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,420
ten to fifteen percent this is measured

840
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,430
fifth two weeks after we applied so

841
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,500
there is even lasting inhibition of

842
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,170
carbon simulation two weeks after

843
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,359
application we look at it there wasn't

844
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,400
an interaction with with weeks after

845
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,899
treatment but we did find that in the

846
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,780
first four weeks was kind of a general

847
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,179
increase in carbon assimilation and

848
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:12,820
transpiration and I think that is a

849
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,610
function of the plants adjusting to the

850
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,280
new higher light intensities however the

851
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,169
episodic drought stress had occurred it

852
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,780
started to really deteriorate plant

853
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:24,730
health and from at week six and at week

854
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,310
eight there's a dramatic decline in

855
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,590
carbon assimilation and transpiration or

856
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:32,820
a theater that that a high-stress

857
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:35,620
environment so how did it change biomass

858
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,240
clipping yield was the only thing that

859
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,549
was significantly different in biomass

860
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,589
and was civitas civitas had higher

861
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,539
clipping yield again again the time

862
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,030
lapses would suggest that it's actually

863
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,889
am that there is some growth component

864
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,110
to that but it could also be the weight

865
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,299
of the oil and counter that though will

866
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,980
stop does have weight itself so then you

867
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,649
also expect to see an increase and we'll

868
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,570
stop that didn't occur there's no change

869
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:00,099
in the above-ground biomass or the root

870
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:04,300
mass although there was a trend of

871
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:06,460
decreased root mass with civitas and the

872
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,950
water contents were the same across the

873
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,139
three it's also obvious too there's no

874
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:14,049
interaction between treatments and weeks

875
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:15,349
after treatment but on week eight we

876
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,820
start to see that as a drum at

877
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:21,319
change in the mass of clipping yield and

878
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,539
especially the route to shoot ratio you

879
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,550
know at week two there's about double

880
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:27,650
the amount of readers there is two there

881
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,320
are roots and at week eight there's

882
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,119
nearly you know seventy percent the

883
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,130
amount of roots and there are above

884
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,630
ground tissue so that draws dress is

885
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,950
definitely changing how carbons being

886
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,039
partitioned in the plan and we see a

887
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:42,679
decline in water content as a result of

888
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:45,130
that drought stress so how does civitas

889
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,989
effects effects storage carbohydrates

890
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,450
when we put civitas down a reduce the

891
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:52,609
starch in water soluble fructans in the

892
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:55,219
turfgrass so we think about water

893
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,860
soluble hands as turf graphs turf

894
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,269
grasses currency and if you ain't doing

895
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,519
any can practice that's reducing the

896
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:03,500
amount of sugars in the plant then

897
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,360
you're potentially reducing the plants

898
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,000
ability to recover from stress later on

899
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,190
during the year interestingly for the

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,380
weeks after treatment the starch levels

901
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,000
decline with drought status stress but

902
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,390
we see an increase in water soluble

903
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,900
carbohydrates as the stress continues on

904
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:22,969
over the course of eight weeks which

905
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,019
some of the literature suggests is would

906
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:25,669
be consistent with literature and

907
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:28,039
suggests that it's the plant then

908
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:34,220
preparing for for regrowth once that

909
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:36,650
stress ends and so finally we looked at

910
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,389
soluble sugar response to these efforts

911
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,280
episodic drought stress and so these are

912
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:42,679
the main sugars that were found in the

913
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,530
above-ground biomass of our turf grass a

914
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,389
fructose glucose and sucrose

915
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,180
myo-inositol sorbitol and trio lows

916
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:51,440
there was no interaction with treatments

917
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:53,359
for my on also tall so they were all

918
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,610
pooled together and we noticed some

919
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,590
interesting trends first looking at two

920
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,230
weeks of four weeks after application in

921
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,480
notice that the treatments are all

922
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,280
physically the same and then as that

923
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,860
drought stress episodic stress really

924
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,550
picked up then we had a real divergence

925
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,200
in the level of soluble carbohydrates in

926
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,630
the tissue and the plant you just have a

927
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,569
soluble carbohydrates for osmoregulation

928
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,570
and it also can use them for signaling a

929
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,360
plant stress so if we focus just on the

930
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,880
eight-week measurements we noticed that

931
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,220
for fructose and glucose we see an

932
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,349
increase in those those sugars

933
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:31,909
with the Civitas compared to the control

934
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,730
and the wheeled stop was in between

935
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:40,009
however for the sucrose there wasn't an

936
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:42,469
increase between the Civitas and the

937
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,570
control plan so the control really had a

938
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,889
dramatic increase in sucrose which the

939
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,349
turfgrass literature and Kentucky

940
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,029
bluegrass suggest sucrose should

941
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,700
increase during drought stress to help

942
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,940
it with osmoregulation then look at

943
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:57,259
sorbitol and triolo some stress sugars

944
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:01,159
we find especially with the tree loss

945
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,220
that there is not a response to drought

946
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,949
stress with trios composite content

947
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:09,230
whereas the control did increase under

948
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:10,819
that drought stress so it brings up some

949
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,579
questions they're really unclear

950
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,289
currently in to require a lot more

951
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:17,358
experimentation understand how civitas

952
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:21,739
is actually affecting plants shrubs

953
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:23,719
dress tolerance but from this there's

954
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:26,419
potential that maybe the Civitas is

955
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:30,108
actually hindering normal plants traps

956
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,340
drought a stress response and if you

957
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,630
look at the quality inn which i didn't

958
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,849
present you would notice that the

959
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,190
Civitas probably handled this the

960
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:40,220
drought stress worse than the wilt stop

961
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,750
or the control did so there is some

962
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:44,088
potential that this could be a negative

963
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,920
response that that the planet is not

964
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:49,400
proceeding the drought with the Civitas

965
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,809
application so kind of in conclusions we

966
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,430
see the increased clipping yield in

967
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:56,409
civitas at the expense of carbohydrate

968
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:58,759
accumulation which has implications for

969
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,529
distressed tolerancing going back to the

970
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,810
beginning of the study that could relate

971
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,560
to that decline in turfgrass stand

972
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:09,500
density by the end of 2013 we did see

973
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,630
the the obvious improvement instr did

974
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,119
not see in an obvious improvement when

975
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,740
turfgrass stress tolerance with civitas

976
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,960
which is kind of contrary to what their

977
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:20,209
marketing campaign would suggest and

978
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,650
we're still unclear why soluble sugars

979
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,139
responded that the way they did it will

980
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,329
require some future experimentation so

981
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:28,699
the kind of look full circle what's

982
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,348
what's happened we've shown that civitas

983
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,689
effects clipping yield and ball roll

984
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:34,309
which may limit its application the

985
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,250
putting green but saw its potential for

986
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:38,298
you know fairways and roughs and tee

987
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,650
boxes and

988
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:42,788
buttock fields in other places that want

989
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,199
to reduce their pesticide usage and

990
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:49,579
there was this phytotoxicity that

991
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:51,829
results from this product and it's

992
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,559
definitely a chronic toxicity from still

993
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:57,289
model innovation which reduced potion

994
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,809
assistant transpiration and Carbonite

995
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:03,289
the carbon dynamics indicate that we

996
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:06,140
have a decrease in soluble or in storage

997
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:07,789
carbohydrates with the Civitas so some

998
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:10,429
future experimentation would be looking

999
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:12,650
to Mai's the dose-response you know

1000
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:16,910
everything I did here was a worst-case

1001
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,739
scenario if I go at less of a rate we'll

1002
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:21,588
have lots of effect on physiology but in

1003
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,630
counter to that will have a less of

1004
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:26,929
effect on that disease priming aspect

1005
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,670
that's use the product is used for we

1006
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:30,139
also measure oxidative stress of

1007
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,369
inhibiting gas exchange is easy to

1008
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:35,929
believe over some difference in

1009
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:37,459
photorespiration and photo inhibition we

1010
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:39,528
should look at the formulation of the

1011
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,058
product right now it's a pretty wide if

1012
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:44,199
they're all paraffins but they range

1013
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:46,130
from 16 carbons of thirty three carbons

1014
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,709
generally products are the less

1015
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:51,068
phytotoxic like a JMS toilet oil they

1016
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:54,018
have really really narrow ranges of

1017
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:58,130
paraffin chain length and so potentially

1018
00:40:54,018 --> 00:41:00,228
maybe there are Frank components of

1019
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,170
civitas they are phytotoxic and they're

1020
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:04,458
not Li increasing the plant defense

1021
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,499
specifically I saw a paper recently got

1022
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:09,618
published like a couple weeks ago that

1023
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:11,118
showed a 16 carbon alkane he's been

1024
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,890
found to prime and do systemic

1025
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,249
resistance and has a lot of potential to

1026
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:17,748
be the active ingredient of civitas and

1027
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:19,788
so we should look at that formulation

1028
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:22,009
more closely and then finally I'm try

1029
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:23,479
understand how civitas affects stress

1030
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:25,159
tolerance because this product is being

1031
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:26,448
applied during the stress of a summer

1032
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,998
season and we should get a better sense

1033
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:32,539
of how that has actually occurring so I

1034
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:35,268
like to thank a lot of people especially

1035
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:38,479
my committee Frank and then dr. Sutter

1036
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:41,118
Bergstrom Zurich and Marty Petrovic I

1037
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:43,518
think my research text Mary learn right

1038
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,380
well Jim undergrad Jordan Gary and

1039
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:49,000
Angela fever who tirelessly counted

1040
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,650
did a lot of things like ball roll

1041
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,329
measurements every day and cleaning

1042
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,490
grass clippings and counting tillers

1043
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:57,099
it's not fun work I could thank

1044
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:59,108
petro-canada because they funded my PhD

1045
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,818
and also Michael pfeffer who's a lead

1046
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:03,250
scientist who developed the product is

1047
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:05,199
very very helpful for all to work with

1048
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,059
good thank Bill Miller helping with the

1049
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,460
carbohydrate analysis fresh and rose

1050
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:14,048
Harmon for actually helping me do the

1051
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,059
analysis twice so I good thank God lying

1052
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:18,608
Chang for in time wit low for let me use

1053
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:20,048
her like or and the be a wild hall plant

1054
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:22,328
care people especially Nick that neck

1055
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:25,028
because who I was very very helpful well

1056
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:26,440
selecting my fiance Katie because aside

1057
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:28,900
from her helping me do a lot of lab

1058
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,548
analysis on weekends she's always very

1059
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,430
very supportive you on occasion she's a

1060
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:36,179
sweet caring compassionate person and

1061
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:39,460
then all my friends that have helped me

1062
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:42,730
survive this three and a half years at

1063
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:46,389
Cornell and helped me survive at burger

1064
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:50,369
barn so with that I'll take any

1065
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:50,368
questions and thank you very much

1066
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:05,929
this has been a production of Cornell

1067
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:05,929
University on the web at cornell edu
