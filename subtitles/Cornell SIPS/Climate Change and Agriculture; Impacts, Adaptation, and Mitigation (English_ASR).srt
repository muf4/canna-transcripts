1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:15,279
University so today begins our our focus

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,278
on Horticulture and a changing climate

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,839
and probably the best person to

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,000
introduce this topic to us is in the

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,679
room um and that's David wolf from our

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
own Department of

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,320
horticulture um David gave me this nice

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,759
bio I'll try to um cut a few Snippets

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,719
from it like many of us um faculty in

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,840
the room David um did his graduate work

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,920
at the University of California

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,000
Davis he go aies he's currently

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,920
professor of plant and soil ecology in

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,520
the department of horiculture he's

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,960
co-chair of the New York state soil

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,239
health program work team um since uh

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,239
1990 he's been a leading Authority on

19
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,599
climate change impacts on crop soils and

20
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,479
ecosystems um with lots of peer-reviewed

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,439
Publications and book chapters and

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,599
reviews and and all sorts of things

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,478
um recently he was the lead author for

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,799
the agriculture chapter of the Northeast

25
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,840
climate change impacts assessment

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,439
released uh July

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,439
2007 um he is the author of The

28
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,599
award-winning Popular Science book on

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,079
soy ecology Tales From The Underground a

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,280
natural history of subterranean life

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,719
published in 2002 so with that I'd like

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,400
to welcome David up to the podium thanks

33
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,560
David thanks a

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,960
lot yeah so it's great to talk to all of

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,920
you about this topic

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,399
um and Neil and I discussed a little bit

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,118
of what I could cover there's over the

38
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,439
years I have done

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,319
various angles of research on this and

40
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,279
we could have dug deep on some of those

41
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,199
but I felt it was best for me to kind of

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,759
give an introductory broad spectrum um

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,640
discussion of some of this I'll be

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,000
touching a little bit on um some new

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159
work that'll be publicly released in

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,399
early November uh the New York state

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,039
funded projects looking at the

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,840
vulnerabilities and ation strategies for

49
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,840
agriculture and for ecosystems in New

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,719
York state it was funded by the nerta um

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
organization and quite a number of

52
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,159
people at Cornel besides myself and

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,879
Jonathan comto who's here help

54
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,560
coordinate that we're involved I'll give

55
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,159
a little few tidbits of uh some of that

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,680
information there's a number of websites

57
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,400
on here I'll come back to them I think

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,640
in my uh uh final slide and uh go

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,439
through some of those with

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:31,079
you where's my mouse or my oh have to

61
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,519
pull up

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,160
okay um first you'll be hearing I think

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
a little later in the term from art de

64
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,598
Gano the climate scientist here Cornell

65
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,518
I've work closely with over the years on

66
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,919
all this and he'll give you a lot of

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,680
details about uh uh climate change

68
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,598
science but I thought to to start our

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,120
session I'll talk a little bit about

70
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,000
climate change and um the the actual

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,680
science of of changing climate per se

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,439
and put a little bit in perspective for

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,000
you um this is a trace uh going back you

74
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:06,639
can see from the back of the room

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,080
400,000 years um and the bottom is the

76
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,238
temperature Trace looking at these we

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,560
can see these diffs in temperature and

78
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,519
rise in temperature these are the

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,519
interglacial periods take place over

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,920
tens of thousands of years so uh we've

81
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,560
got that going on you can see reasonably

82
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,318
well correlated with that we also have

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
uh with the change of temperatures two

84
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,280
key greenhouse gases going up and down

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,080
methane and Carbono side uh keep in mind

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,959
uh you know this is all going on well

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,959
before humans were very important on the

88
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,080
planet right right about here is where

89
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,680
humans started human agriculture started

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,360
right to put this in perspective way

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
over here so yes the climate's always

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,599
been changing uh humans aren't the only

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
one nobody's trying to say humans are

94
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,359
the only ones causing climate a lot of

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,000
this is due and art may get into some of

96
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,439
this with you to uh planetary shifts

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,959
minor shifts in the uh Earth's axis uh

98
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,799
Sun activity Etc and a lot of this work

99
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,120
has scientists have understood for some

100
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,760
time some of the driving uh forces of

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,840
this but certainly the greenhouse gases

102
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,158
are are part of this whole story and

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,598
what I'm going to show you in the next

104
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,199
graph it's it's got the same thing on

105
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:20,000
the x-axis going down 400,000 years um

106
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,120
but it's it's going to show just the CO2

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Trace I'll replace some of that and then

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,600
we're going to see where CO2 is going

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,639
again to kind of put things in

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
perspective so now it's a the X the y-

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,840
AIS is here's that CO2 Trace we saw in

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,960
the last graph going back 400,000 years

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,918
it got a different y- axis scale so it's

114
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,478
all shrunk down but you can see we go

115
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,560
back almost half a million years CO2

116
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,240
never really gets above 280 points per

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,680
million CO2 is going up and down yes

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
even before humans were on the planet

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,199
it's going up and down but right about

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
here humans are on the planet and they

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,000
start affecting things and I guess

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199
somewhere right about there was when I

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,639
was in grad school in C2 was about 33

124
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,759
parts ion it's up at 390 parts per

125
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,199
million now uh so you can see we are

126
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,720
already and this is actually a little

127
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,879
out of date it'll be up a little bit

128
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,479
higher um we are already uh due to human

129
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,719
activity fossil fuel burning and other

130
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:19,639
things moving the CO2 levels beyond what

131
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,039
we've seen for the past 400,000 years

132
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,000
and now the projections for the future

133
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,399
look like this based on current rates of

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,800
fossil fuel emissions and based on um

135
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,719
know the best estimates

136
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,840
scientists have we have kind of two

137
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,680
scenarios that are typically depicted

138
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,599
the lower scenario would be one of if

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
within the next decade or two Society

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,439
gets gets really moves quickly away from

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,400
um

142
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:50,199
uh energy um uh products that release

143
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,359
CO2 or other greenhouse gases and give

144
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,038
it really clean energy and efficiency if

145
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,080
we don't do much in just wait and see

146
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,839
what happens we're on that kind of trace

147
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,240
and remember the CO2 levels these all

148
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,519
these fluctuations we saw before they

149
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,600
Corr with

150
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,478
temperature so you can see why this kind

151
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,319
of Spooks us a little bit thinking about

152
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,240
CO2 getting this far out of whx so

153
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,919
that's just to put it in

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,680
perspective here's something that be a

155
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,198
little more familiar to you um plan hard

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
is zone maps these colorcoded Maps this

157
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,478
is the one for the US on the left there

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,439
1990 usda's last map um the this is the

159
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,000
color codes refer to the coldest it gets

160
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,399
in the winter minimum winter

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,839
temperatures and garden centers and

162
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,159
farmers are aware of this sort of thing

163
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,560
uh the minimum winter temperatures

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,039
determine what kind of ornamentals you

165
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,639
might put in your garden uh but keep in

166
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,598
mind also minimum winter temperatures

167
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,439
are very crucial to for example the

168
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,478
habitable range of insect and insect

169
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,598
pests um and where about crops we might

170
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,680
grow different places where weed species

171
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,478
will grow so that's the 1990 map um this

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,478
has always been based on the last 15

173
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,439
years of weather records it's a very

174
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,038
pretty laborious but very

175
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,918
straightforward procedure you look at

176
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,680
all the Noah weather stations all the

177
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,799
WEA station the same stuff we get the

178
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,800
our weather reports from on the news in

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,280
the evening go back the last 15 years

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
and you look at the minimum temperatures

181
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,679
and develop these codes uh redone in

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,919
2006 and I think even from the back of

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,879
the room you can see no matter where you

184
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,038
live in the US we've had some very

185
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,520
dramatic uh change in minimal winter

186
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:21,478
temperatures in just that period of time

187
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,159
um almost no matter where you live we're

188
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,918
in a different heiness Zone I've got a

189
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,280
project with u the New York Botanic

190
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,918
Garden in in the Bronx New York where a

191
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,119
few years ago they put in a test Garden

192
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,959
of all some ornamentals that are really

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,038
one part in the stone warmer than than

194
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,799
the old map and those things are still

195
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,399
doing okay um so um that's the key thing

196
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,598
there to kind of put it a little bit

197
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,560
something a little more familiar for you

198
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,878
in terms of what's happening with the

199
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,439
climate this pace of change is really uh

200
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,158
not something Way Beyond what we've seen

201
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,399
in the last half million million two

202
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,598
million years on this planet uh this

203
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,918
kind of this is much faster than the

204
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,478
typical like what I was showing you

205
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,318
those AO graphs the interglacial uh

206
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,639
periods we here in the last 15 20 years

207
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,120
typically would take more like a you

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,598
know 500 years a thousand years and so

209
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,918
one question is you know what species

210
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,279
will be able to keep up with this in

211
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,038
terms of moving around to stay in their

212
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,519
their ideal Zone

213
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,680
not uh getting even closer to home this

214
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,719
is some information on the uh Northeast

215
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,079
in particular and um one thing we

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,080
noticed in the Northeast is is that

217
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,478
while we're we're we're experiencing you

218
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,680
know warming just like the global

219
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,240
warming is happening where our warming

220
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,080
rate on annual basis is slightly faster

221
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,278
than the average global annual warming

222
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,560
but in particular our Winters are

223
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,080
warming more than our summers and so

224
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,518
winter temperatures um here in the

225
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,800
Northeast have gone up over 4 degrees

226
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,278
fhe on average across the Northeast this

227
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,519
is just different color dots different

228
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,320
size dots indicating how much increase

229
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,839
there's been uh from this period this

230
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,680
was a evaluation from 1970 2002 and uh I

231
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,760
guess the key thing is to see no matter

232
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,879
where you look on this map there's

233
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,399
nowhere showing a decrease in temp or

234
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,399
stabilization of temperature everywhere

235
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,519
there's an increase in winter

236
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,759
temperature it's a matter of how much

237
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,360
and that wouldn't put a whole lot of

238
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,039
stock in exactly where you live and

239
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,240
because there are some issues with

240
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,120
certain weather stations Etc but um it's

241
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,600
pretty you know just adds to the

242
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,759
evidence that um not just even we're not

243
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,120
even getting Into Climate milence

244
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,759
projected in the future now just what's

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,360
really happening in our recent history

246
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,838
so some pretty dramatic changes

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,399
now and this is what really fascinates

248
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,279
me and what really has dug me even

249
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,559
deeper into this whole is you as an

250
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,240
ecologist plant scientist uh recognizing

251
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,719
that plants can be looked at as very

252
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,799
sensitive weather instruments you might

253
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,720
say and uh these living things like

254
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,000
plants are also responding to the

255
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,480
climate change we've already been

256
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,879
experiencing so again they're not yet

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,079
talking about trying to predict the

258
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,879
future climate models you might not

259
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:53,078
trust just talking about what's been

260
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,639
happening um and so myself and alao a

261
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,000
number of other people a few years ago

262
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,039
looked up some dug up some historical

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,078
records of Bloom dates of app

264
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,838
and lilacs throughout the Northeast and

265
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,879
documented that all three of these pral

266
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,000
fruit crops in our region are indeed

267
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,078
blooming earlier than they did um

268
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,480
previously by as much as a week or more

269
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,399
depending on the particular species so

270
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,120
and these are just things we have

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,120
records for we're also seeing changes in

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,440
uh arrivals of butterflies and uh insect

273
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,839
um arrivals and bird arrivals Etc this

274
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,279
is I won't take a time to go through

275
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,680
this is just a number of peer-reviewed

276
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,039
papers besides ours documenting other

277
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,000
things

278
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,078
more or less in our region more

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,440
indicators of the Living World already

280
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,278
responding to the change we're seeing

281
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,399
ourv words Arnold arum showing earlier

282
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,759
Bloom dates as well wild flowers in

283
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Washington DC earlier arrival of Migrant

284
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,319
birds in New York Etc so when people say

285
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,000
they don't believe in climate change and

286
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,480
I have this evidence I I just not sure

287
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,480
what where they're coming from on all

288
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,600
that um because it seems to me that it's

289
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,519
you know fairly it comes in from sort of

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,800
angles in terms of evidence that is

291
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,440
already happening I mean you could say

292
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,679
you're not sure what the causes are but

293
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
certainly something's changing out there

294
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,759
fairly

295
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,720
rapid now talking about the future uh so

296
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,240
Neil mentioned briefly this northeast

297
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,720
climate impacts assessment I was

298
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,440
involved with some years ago and uh

299
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,000
there we had our whole team of climate

300
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
modelers um and I won't go into the

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,360
details and get art might get into this

302
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,240
more with you later in the term uh had a

303
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,278
whole emble the latest and greatest uh

304
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,120
GCM Global circulation models and uh

305
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,559
also regionally downscaled these through

306
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
our region came up with the best

307
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,278
estimates they could on what the future

308
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,079
holds for our area not just looking at

309
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:48,919
the past and to just go to sort of the

310
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,679
uh extreme end of things looking at the

311
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:54,159
end of the century again sort of

312
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,719
assuming uh two scenarios here because

313
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,600
the most difficult thing predicting the

314
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,600
climate in the future is not so much the

315
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,920
physic of climate B but what is society

316
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,480
going to do are we going to go on this

317
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,240
lower emissions pathway or are we going

318
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,278
to kind of do this business as usual

319
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
thing and you can see even if we go on a

320
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,879
lower emissions pathway due to lags in

321
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,519
the system and a lot of details um that

322
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,360
have to do with how the climate responds

323
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,399
to greenhouse gases and such we're

324
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,839
looking at uh you know a few to several

325
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,240
degrees uh continued warming by end of

326
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,760
century and uh worst case business as

327
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
usual we kind of just move along like we

328
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,198
are now and not pay much attention to it

329
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,879
could have as much as 7 to 11 or

330
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:37,359
12° so put that in perspective this

331
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,759
higher emission scenario think for for a

332
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,278
100 years from now or less um that

333
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,159
amount of temperature change well like

334
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,519
where we we're sitting right now about

335
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,120
15,000 years ago was all under a glacial

336
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,159
High sheet you know hundreds of feet

337
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,519
thick in some places and the temperature

338
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,120
was about 12 11° F cooler than it is

339
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,320
today and over the course of 15,000

340
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,759
years wared and we've got what we've got

341
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,959
here now we're talking about in a 100

342
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,078
years let's let's double down on that

343
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,078
and see what happens

344
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,680
so um with our winter temperatures in

345
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,120
our region uh there's all kinds of

346
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:16,638
little nuances and I'm just going to

347
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,078
give you a couple again just in sort of

348
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,759
this broad overview introductory talk

349
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,638
one that sort of intrigued me and it has

350
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,000
to do with the the effect of U warmer

351
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,278
Winters has on snow cover and this then

352
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,240
affects albo reflectivity of the um

353
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,879
surface the more snow you have the less

354
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
warming that goes on during the winter

355
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,240
because a lot of light is reflected back

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,240
up when we have warmer temperatures it

357
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,000
feeds on itself because you have less

358
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,480
snow cover fewer snow cover days it gets

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,679
warmer and warmer snow melts more and

360
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,759
basically that's why our Winters are

361
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,439
warmer than our summers that's why the

362
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,319
high latitude regions of the planet are

363
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,959
warm warming more than the mid latitude

364
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
regions this graphic on the left is the

365
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,919
red outline of the Northeast there on

366
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,680
that map shows the

367
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,519
uh historical looking at the Historical

368
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:08,559
records I think that was from

369
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,078
19 uh 61 to 1990 the average U the the

370
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,439
region of the Northeast where you had at

371
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:15,399
least 30 days of snow cover in the

372
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,440
winter and then the white area here a

373
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,240
much smaller white area is what's

374
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
projected for end of century how much of

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,959
our region will actually see a minimum

376
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,440
of 30 days of snow cover uh by end of

377
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,359
century and with the business's usual

378
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,480
scenario so big difference in

379
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,680
snow has um we kind of think of snow as

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
cold but also of course it's a big

381
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,919
insulating blanket in the winter a lot

382
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,919
of um species are dependent on that

383
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:44,039
insulation uh for their Winter survival

384
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,719
and a lot of microbial activity actually

385
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,639
stay keeps going during the winter

386
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,720
because just below a snow blanket

387
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,079
temperatures hover around freezing and

388
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,720
you can still have a lot of nitrogen

389
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,239
mineralization and things like that uh

390
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,680
some of you may have been here long

391
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,079
enough to know Justin Rich a recent

392
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:02,078
graduate student of mine who had the

393
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
kind of tough project of having snow

394
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,120
removal plots versus no snow removal

395
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,159
plots so a lot of snow shoveling all

396
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,959
winter to look at what fewer snow

397
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,559
covered days would mean for so microbial

398
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,439
community structure in particular

399
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,439
looking at the nitrogen cycle in soils

400
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,079
over the winter and found that make a

401
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
long story short there was more nitrate

402
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,758
leeching from soils with lower snow

403
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,480
cover uh because of less smaller um

404
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,399
microbium biomass in the win lots of

405
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,879
other interesting things which I don't

406
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,679
really have time to get into but it

407
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,159
affects denitrification rates spring Tha

408
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,519
nit nitrate losses overwintering of

409
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,559
pathogens and beneficial NES spring weed

410
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,560
sea termination all those things

411
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,559
affected just by the snow

412
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,159
cover um

413
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,160
so all of this climate business that's

414
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,318
happening and is projected to

415
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,240
happen um a lot more than I have time to

416
00:15:54,318 --> 00:16:00,078
go into but impacts are going to be our

417
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,440
ecosystems are really undoubtedly going

418
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,278
to be doing some kind of level of

419
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,480
disassembly coming apart in some ways

420
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,439
some species benefiting from the change

421
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,800
some not some dying off some dispersing

422
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,240
to other regions uh and then

423
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,000
reassembling in new ways and we really

424
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,039
it's I don't think you know we've just

425
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,600
had this uh major project looking at

426
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,958
ecosystems and some of the best e colist

427
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,000
here at Cornell and throughout the state

428
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,559
working with us and you know nobody can

429
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,958
really predict exactly what's going to

430
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,159
happen this is the maps on the left here

431
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,919
are just showing what could happen to

432
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,719
some of our major tree species groups

433
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,559
for

434
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,079
example um and this is based on a very

435
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,119
simple analysis just looking at how the

436
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,359
uh basic climate's going to change and

437
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,679
how that's going to affect the habitable

438
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,560
zone of different tree species so as the

439
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,638
habitable zone for certain tree species

440
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,758
is no longer Optimum it will be

441
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,799
disappearing and so this color code for

442
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,959
the Northeast in the upper left here

443
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,919
you'll see a lot of gold uh that's Maple

444
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,558
Beach Birch our Maple Beach Birch forest

445
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,720
and if you look jump down all the way to

446
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,318
the far end of the end of the century um

447
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,919
business as usual scenario you'll see

448
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,038
very little gold in New York state very

449
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,520
little Maple Beach Birch in other words

450
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:18,279
the maple Beach birch tree communities

451
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,759
could potentially disappear from our

452
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,639
region or begin to they're significantly

453
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,078
negatively affected Anyway by the

454
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,559
climate will they really disappear will

455
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,480
they really this is projecting that they

456
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,519
would be replaced by Oak Hickory P type

457
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Forest well will the seeds of the Oak

458
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,798
hory Pine get up here complicated uh for

459
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,558
example let's just take the oak story as

460
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,759
one little interesting case um it turns

461
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,240
out that deer are likely to benefit a

462
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,640
lot from climate change warmer Winters

463
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,160
less snow cover they can eat more

464
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,720
vegetation in the winter and of uh

465
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,120
various trees seedlings what they like

466
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,798
to eat a lot is Oak so while the Oaks

467
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,279
could benefit in terms of climate they

468
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,558
could be fed on More by the deer that

469
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:02,000
are benefiting so this one example of

470
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:03,240
how complicated is to our future but um

471
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,558
that's uh that's kind of what we're

472
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,640
going to be dealing with gives us all I

473
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,399
guess some work to do I won't spend too

474
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,038
much time on this is some specific

475
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,798
species um some that are two species

476
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,038
likely to lose suitable habitat gain

477
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,319
suitable habitat again there could be a

478
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,319
lot of other confounding factors that

479
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:25,439
affect this um so I won't there a lot of

480
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,000
details there I

481
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,640
talk a thing that U concerns anybody

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,679
about the interaction between species

483
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,640
the topology of all of that is one thing

484
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,000
we know for certain is there's no two

485
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,960
species out there that are going to

486
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,599
respond exactly the same to climate

487
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,079
change just like probably no two humans

488
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,519
are going to respond exactly the same

489
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,119
some of us are going to like what's

490
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,519
changes are happening and some might not

491
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,119
um so that could affect species

492
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,720
interactions and as we have this change

493
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,558
in climate zones we also know with great

494
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,558
certainty that we're not going to have

495
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,279
entire complex ecosystem multiple

496
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,720
species moving in Mass together staying

497
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,440
coordinated there's going to be a lot of

498
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,000
a rupture of those things and so how

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,679
might that mess up things like plants

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,960
and pollinators If plants are blooming

501
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,400
earlier pollinators be there uh natural

502
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,720
enemies and pest Etc so but here we have

503
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,798
uh there's really a lot of room for a

504
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,640
lot of research um minimal evidence of

505
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:25,480
major disruptions at this point there's

506
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,159
some redundancy in our

507
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,440
ecosystems uh so a big question there

508
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,080
but something that we I think most feel

509
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,200
is going to be an issue um here and

510
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,720
there of public great

511
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,519
importance now let me move on on to

512
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,000
agriculture which I'll tend to focus on

513
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:49,279
more specifically um in the rest the top

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,119
and um if you talk to home gardeners or

515
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,319
Farmers about longer growing seasons and

516
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,639
warmer

517
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,038
temperatures um their eyes can light up

518
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,320
and think well I can grow Chamas grow

519
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,359
them before I can grow better

520
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,359
watermelons we can do better job with

521
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:10,279
red wine grapes um and in fact you know

522
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:13,000
there's certainly um truth to this and

523
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,200
compared to some parts of the world um

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,038
we will I think in our region there's

525
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,000
certainly a possibility that we have

526
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,599
some real opportunities and here at

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,119
Cornell we're all about working with

528
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,399
Farmers to take advantage of any of

529
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,839
these opportunities I think the tricky

530
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,720
thing for Farmers is going to be not

531
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,359
jumping the gun on these things um um

532
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,200
knowing and and this is where I think

533
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,918
people like Cornell can help for example

534
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,960
someone like art or climate scientist

535
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,559
providing more than just anecdotal

536
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,240
information about whether weather trends

537
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,599
are sort of part of a real climate

538
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,640
change phenomenon or just a flute that

539
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,678
kind of thing so we're very much about

540
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,600
helping Farmers decide if they want to

541
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,000
start making some changes or gardeners

542
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,719
as well there is a downside to our

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,798
region and we we will if you look south

544
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,400
of here and you look at the wheat

545
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,319
pressure south of here you look at the

546
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,440
insect pressure the dis pressure it's

547
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,119
much greater than we have here uh Sweet

548
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,720
Corn Growers in uh a place like Florida

549
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,199
Florida Georgia can

550
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,038
spray 15 times a year for some

551
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,640
lepidopteran pests where some years we

552
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,919
may get away with just a couple sprays

553
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,440
here for example so pesticide loads

554
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,120
could be an issue summer heat stress um

555
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,480
while um warmer temperatures in summer

556
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,759
could benefit some crops we will

557
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,038
certainly have more heat stress days and

558
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,038
then I'll talk a little bit more about

559
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,558
Water Management we could have sort of a

560
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,839
situation here we have both too much and

561
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,879
too little water we kind of have um

562
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,240
climate projections indicate perhaps

563
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,240
both sides of that coin um U we'll have

564
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,079
to deal with

565
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,919
here just to take a specific example for

566
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,960
the New York uh fingerlakes region and

567
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,919
our the wine grape the bipo wine grape

568
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,519
industry that's as we all know been

569
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,000
growing by Leaps and Bounds since the

570
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,200
1970s or so um just coincidence really I

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,359
think or fortuitously for many of those

572
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,038
people we've been moving into this

573
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,439
warming phase and a lot of those

574
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,038
European grapes that are not native to

575
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,278
our region they can suffer pretty severe

576
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,919
damage atus 12 Fahrenheit or less we

577
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,159
used to have more Winters with those

578
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,840
really low temperatures we've had fewer

579
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,000
since that industry's been expanding and

580
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,158
so really I think and the projections

581
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,798
are that we should see continuation of

582
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,919
that phenomenon so I think that industry

583
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,240
is an industry where there could be some

584
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,080
potential but oddly something we've been

585
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,599
seeing lately is more free damage in

586
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,759
some of our benifer plantings even in

587
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,480
years when we've had warmer Winters and

588
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,839
by warmer Winters I mean if we take the

589
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,839
average December plus January plus

590
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,678
February temperature we can have a

591
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,199
winter like that where the average of

592
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,480
those three months of the winter is

593
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
warmer and we can still have more freeze

594
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,880
damage uh than we've seen previously and

595
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,120
this can kind of come in two it can

596
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,159
happen from two angles one is you can

597
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,319
have an unusually warm December which

598
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,440
UPS your average winter temperature but

599
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:00,960
then the plants don't hard proper or

600
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
maybe they started to harden in November

601
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640
and then they come out of this hardening

602
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,038
process and then you have a normal

603
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,200
January and they get hard hit by freeze

604
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,359
which is what we saw in a couple of

605
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,120
years 2003 2004 literally millions of

606
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,798
dollars of damage um finger legs you can

607
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,798
also have premature Leaf out in the

608
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:21,599
spring the other end of winter not early

609
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,278
winter but things degree day

610
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,319
accumulation happening Le prop and

611
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:29,200
that's some damage so um I think you

612
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,200
might say

613
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,840
um you know speculative but I imagine we

614
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,159
will sort of gradually as the century

615
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:38,399
goes on grow out of this problem but

616
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,400
right now it's a very serious

617
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,559
problem however some other regions have

618
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,720
more you know you have to think about

619
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,879
what's happening on the rest of the

620
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,480
country and the rest of the world um in

621
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
California they've got even more serious

622
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,079
concerns I think about their food

623
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,278
Industries um Napa Valley so famous for

624
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,798
its wine quality summer heat stress

625
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:57,798
projections there look very bad for

626
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,440
maintaining that same level of quality

627
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:01,240
and later in the ter we're going to have

628
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,558
great Jones who's going to talk to us

629
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,319
quite a bit about the grape and wine

630
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,759
industry and so that no want to miss

631
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,119
that one it should be interesting

632
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,480
another thing it's a bigger issue in

633
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,798
California than it is here as most of

634
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,440
you in this room would know our

635
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,679
perennial food crops actually need some

636
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
cold temperatures in winter in order to

637
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,320
be hormonally primed in the spring you

638
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,720
might say to flower properly and all

639
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,639
that have this chill hour requirement

640
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,839
temperatures roughly have to stay below

641
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,720
about 45 deg f for so many days Etc and

642
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,038
um this this graphic just shows that in

643
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,640
parts of different parts of California

644
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,398
um that's going to be a problem for a

645
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,000
lot of food crops where important food

646
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,798
crop growing areas they not even having

647
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,558
enough cold temperatures in Winter

648
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,960
probably not a big problem for us maybe

649
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,678
some of our late in the century we might

650
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,278
have some problem with some of our Apple

651
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,480
varieties that have very long Winter

652
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,519
Chill requirements temperatures really

653
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,319
get warm in the winter but um more of a

654
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,319
is for

655
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,960
Califor um something that will hit us I

656
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,440
already is warmer Winters is going to

657
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,600
mean more um over wintering survival of

658
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,038
marginally overwintering insect pests

659
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,918
they could have more Generations in the

660
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:15,079
summer season uh northward expansion of

661
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,559
their range Etc invasive wheat species

662
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,359
KSU any of you from the south could be

663
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,798
familiar with that very notorious and

664
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,158
basic weed its range is very much

665
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:25,398
dictated by the minimum winter

666
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:28,720
temperatures and those are going up in

667
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:30,199
our region so uh the cor worm is story

668
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,798
where already we're kind of seeing some

669
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,240
adaptation you might say of agriculture

670
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,839
in New York to climate change where our

671
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,200
IPM Scouts are having to set out

672
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,839
pheromone traps to look for um activity

673
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,200
of corn worm earlier than they ever did

674
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,359
before and already sort of adapting to

675
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,880
that being more of a pest the flea is a

676
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,558
vector of Stewart's world big problem in

677
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,799
corn is a marginally over wintering

678
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:59,079
insect and becoming more of an

679
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:01,158
issue this is a graphic um uh

680
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,678
showing the the spread of the kudu range

681
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,679
for example into the Northeast and the

682
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,600
top panel is looking at the business's

683
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,000
usual emission scenario again comparing

684
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,398
these scenarios the fossil fuel

685
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,319
emissions versus the lower Emissions on

686
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:19,079
the bottom early Century to the end of

687
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,960
the century dark orange is Kazu coming

688
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,398
to get

689
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,759
us and U you can see it's marching up

690
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,599
that make some difference a lower

691
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:30,759
emission scenario would be much less

692
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,759
for

693
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,640
us um while I'm speaking of weeds and

694
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,439
kudu uh another interesting phenomenon

695
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,159
about weeds is that it turns out that

696
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,558
fast growing species in general um such

697
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:50,600
as our weeds are um tend to benefit more

698
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:53,038
from the direct effect of just the

699
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,119
higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

700
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,278
so I suppose many of you are familiar

701
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,678
with this so-called CO2 fertilization

702
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,278
effect uh plants take up CO2 for

703
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,880
photosynthesis to produce sugars to grow

704
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:07,038
and so most of our so-called C3 plants

705
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,679
with C3 photosynthetic pth in particular

706
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,759
have the potential to get some some

707
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,759
Boost from higher CO2 in the atmosphere

708
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,158
irrespective of climate change just

709
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,278
looking at that effect alone and this is

710
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,360
actually how I first got into the

711
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,558
climate change research realm back in

712
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,719
the late 80s early 90s was looking

713
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,240
specifically at the CO2 effect um the

714
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,319
the the species that tend to take the

715
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,558
most advantage of this and get the most

716
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,439
it are plants that can to put it in

717
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,918
simple terms find a place to put the new

718
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,960
sugars they're producing the extra

719
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,640
sugars uh more quickly than they get

720
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,440
feedback effects starting to slow down

721
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,559
their photosynthetic um capacity so you

722
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,080
can have this kind of downward

723
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,000
photosynthetic acclamation to high CO2

724
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,480
phenomenon for plants that don't have

725
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,038
the sink capacity for the new sugars

726
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,440
they're producing and it terms of the

727
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,079
fast growing weeds really benefit a lot

728
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
uh this is Canadian thistle not only do

729
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:00,720
they benefit more but my colleague L

730
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,599
zisa that a lot with weeds and CO2 has

731
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,278
documented for a lot of weed

732
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,918
species that it takes more uh they're

733
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,880
they're more resistant to herbicide

734
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,320
control so this is showing an experiment

735
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,519
with u Canadian thistle grown at today

736
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,558
CO2 levels versus CO2 levels expected by

737
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,798
mid to late Century um same level of

738
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,480
glyphosate Round Up sprayed on both had

739
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,359
to go to two to three times the

740
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,839
recommended rate of Cate to get similar

741
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,038
control so how will Farmers adapt and

742
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,359
gardeners adapt to this phenomenon of

743
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,359
climate

744
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:41,038
change spray more spray more so this is

745
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,158
our kind of a conundrum and you know a

746
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,079
major issue that we're you know trying

747
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,360
to alert policy makers too I'm working

748
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,079
both with the dec and addtive markets on

749
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,398
trying to get everybody sort of poised

750
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,079
about climate change issues we can't be

751
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,599
tying the hands of farmers for adapting

752
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,759
to climate change on the other hand we

753
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,480
have to be proactive this sort of thing

754
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,119
perhaps be proactive about developing

755
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,679
alternatives to chemicals for weeds we

756
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,759
see coming up uh that could be more of a

757
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:11,798
problem Etc

758
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:14,960
ET summer heat stress um even for a crab

759
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:17,079
like tomatoes which uh currently is

760
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,919
really you could argue you know

761
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,599
marginally adapted to our region where

762
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,159
this is not we have had some important

763
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,918
tomato processing industry in some years

764
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
in the past but um it's not perfectly

765
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,640
suited to our region but so it should

766
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,960
benefit some from warmer temperates but

767
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,399
even Tomatoes you get some high

768
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,759
temperature stress during reproductive

769
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,199
phas and you can have terrible effects

770
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,720
on quality Etc and there's no question

771
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,798
any of the climate model projections you

772
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,278
look for our look at for our region we

773
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,519
will have increased frequency of the

774
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,599
number of days that exceed high

775
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,919
temperature thresholds for cops like

776
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,398
that we're particularly concerned about

777
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,519
the dairy industry it turns out that

778
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:55,359
dairy cows um uh you don't mind my

779
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,640
deviating a bit from horiculture here um

780
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,439
and I had to learn this from my animal

781
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,200
scientist colleague lar Chase has worked

782
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,240
with us over years on climate change um

783
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,720
dairy cows really like it cool like 40

784
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,079
to 70° F that's Peak milk production for

785
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,519
dairy cows so we've had Although our

786
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,079
dairy industry has a lot of challenges

787
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,519
uh this is the advantage we've had is

788
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,398
don't have to have dairy barns with a

789
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,079
lot of fancy cooling equipment um and we

790
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,798
have cows can really work at their Peak

791
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,678
but certainly um this just show some uh

792
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,720
model projections showing no production

793
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,000
decline in the future for the Northeast

794
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,798
unless farmers do some fairly

795
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,398
straightforward adaptations improving

796
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,879
the ventilation system of their Dairy

797
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,599
barns in and putting in more fans

798
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,200
however this is a capital cost and you

799
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,798
know one question we have is will the

800
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,759
farmers have that Capital to make that

801
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:50,278
transition um as many of you know a lot

802
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,119
of the dairy industry is the farmers are

803
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:53,960
right at the edge and um they might just

804
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,798
as

805
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,079
soon sell out as have to come up with

806
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,200
that kind of capit kind of adjustment

807
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,720
and yet there could be people from

808
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,840
another region a warmer part of the

809
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,079
country who look at this as an

810
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,918
opportunity and buy up some of those

811
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,720
dairies so it could exacerbate already

812
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,600
consolidation we're seeing of the dairy

813
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,240
industry

814
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:18,918
here this is showing um uh some details

815
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,440
of the projections for the

816
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,080
northeast of temperature on the top

817
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,159
graph and rainfall on the bottom and

818
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,000
there's that's a little more than a

819
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,919
little more detail than I really you

820
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,558
really need to pay attention to it's

821
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:37,200
showing a few different um uh climate

822
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,278
emission scenarios and different times

823
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,480
into the future what I really want you

824
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,278
to just look at is looking at if we look

825
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,558
at

826
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,558
temperature you can see whether we look

827
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,599
at the annual temperature the winter

828
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,158
temperature the summer temperature no

829
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,079
matter what model we're looking at or

830
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,480
emission

831
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,879
scenario we've got this general you know

832
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,880
temperature increase where precipitation

833
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,159
it's a little different um

834
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
well I guess the good news but s of the

835
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,240
good news the annual precipitation for

836
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,798
our region is not projected to decline

837
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,558
dramatically like we see for other parts

838
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,119
of the world subsaharan Africa or even

839
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,678
parts of the Western West it's uh

840
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,638
precipitation is harder for modelers to

841
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,360
predict so the data is a little more

842
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:17,558
bigger aor bars often and a little

843
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,759
harder to dict but you might say looking

844
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,440
at the data data overall that

845
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,440
precipitation might stay constant for

846
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,399
our region might go up a little might go

847
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,278
down a little but um the increase that

848
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,959
we do see is likely to come Winter and

849
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:32,519
probably winter rainfall not snowfall uh

850
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,720
very little

851
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:39,319
change uh in summer rainfall what very

852
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,120
little change at all so about the same

853
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:44,398
some variability Etc so if we have

854
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:48,398
warmer temperatures in the

855
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,759
summer and the exact same

856
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,798
rainfall what's that going to do to crop

857
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,798
of Appo transpiration and crop water

858
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,880
needs they're going to need more you

859
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,278
have to have yeah you have to have a a

860
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,799
compensatory increase in rainfall really

861
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,278
to keep up with the warmer temperatures

862
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:09,720
and increased aand to not have increased

863
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,519
um water requirements so so even while

864
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,759
we're not projecting you know extreme uh

865
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,440
droughts the end of agriculture in New

866
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,119
York because of drought I think there's

867
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,519
going to be more challenges more more

868
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,759
need for irrigation in our

869
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,399
region I've got a couple other slides to

870
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,079
go into a little more detail about the

871
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,638
irrigation story for um our region uh

872
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,398
first this is showing um just to inform

873
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,079
you that even today we kind of think of

874
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,398
our New York is having rainfall enough

875
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,439
rainfall for summer crop production but

876
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:41,038
actually in some parts particularly this

877
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720
is looking at Rochester which is one of

878
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,359
the drier parts of the state but also a

879
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,798
very important veg production area for

880
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,839
example a food CR production area

881
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,798
looking at it this is historical records

882
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,158
uh you can see that in a these months

883
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,038
here month 678 we're referring to the

884
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,960
middle of the summer uh this is

885
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,440
potential of Apple transpiration this is

886
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,000
full canopy covered too by the way we

887
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,360
haven't really modified this for bir

888
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,240
crop growth Etc but the the maximum

889
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,039
potential of a transportation exceeds

890
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,358
the the rainfall in the summer in our

891
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:14,320
region so really you know to to grow

892
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:17,199
Optimum uh crops in Rochester New York

893
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,079
in an average quote average year um

894
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,960
while there's you might be able to rely

895
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,440
to some to get take take care of some of

896
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,720
this Gap uh with water holding capacity

897
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,720
of the soil and crop booting depth but

898
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,598
probably you'll need supplement

899
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,239
irrigation a lot of

900
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,559
and what our models project for the

901
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,598
future is that that's going to become

902
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,199
more dramatic of course and irrigation

903
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,039
requirements are going to go up because

904
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,199
this is going to go up and precipitation

905
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:43,000
is projected to stay about the

906
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,118
same uh this graphic is uh a little

907
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,280
tricky and I'll point out just a couple

908
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,240
things to give you the key points so

909
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,960
this is looking at looking trying to

910
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,878
look into the future and looking at B1

911
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,800
and A2 refer to the uh two different

912
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,759
emission scenario

913
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,800
and this is looking later and later into

914
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,400
the century and this is again focused on

915
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,640
Rochester New York I was just showing

916
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,358
you historic data and this is doing an

917
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,000
analysis for the historic data and it's

918
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,880
looking at these this color code refers

919
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,079
to how much of a summer water deficit we

920
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,079
can get um and we can see that if you

921
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,760
look at this blue code down in the

922
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,079
bottom here about one 10 years we have

923
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,520
absolutely no deficit plenty of water um

924
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,920
for the season historically and about

925
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:32,079
10% of the years we have pretty severe

926
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,159
deficits where if you don't have

927
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,200
irrigation there's probably no way

928
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,559
you're going to have a a good crop and

929
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,239
if you just look at this Teel blue color

930
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,960
at the top here you can see that as you

931
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:45,319
might expect expanding more and more of

932
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,838
the uh years more

933
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,039
frequency uh more chances of this kind

934
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,159
of severe deficit summer as we go into

935
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,920
this is kind of a worst case scenario

936
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,920
we're doing future analyses looking at

937
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,599
some other P models and also this is

938
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,119
assuming full can be covered for the

939
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,119
whole summer which is kind of a wor casy

940
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,280
scenario but it's more just comparing

941
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,559
the historical to projected to give you

942
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,920
an idea I think without question one

943
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,480
thing we can say with confidence is that

944
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,039
irrigation requirements will go up at

945
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,599
the same time we have a current trend

946
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,639
for increased frequency of high rainfall

947
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:21,039
events more of our rain in the Northeast

948
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,239
in the past 30 years or so is coming

949
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,639
down packaged in rainfall like 1 to two

950
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,318
Ines in 48 hours and that's projected to

951
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,679
continue so more flooding is projected

952
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,239
for our regions to more increased

953
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,118
frequency of flooding

954
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,358
events um so we're going to get it from

955
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,760
both angles and the challenge for

956
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:41,239
Farmers is what do I do do I I've had

957
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,560
flooding the last three years is this a

958
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,959
permanent phenomenon should I invest

959
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,078
$10,000 in a new drainage system or wait

960
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,559
no they're telling me drought's going to

961
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,440
be happening when should I invest in an

962
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,679
irrigation system and what they were

963
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,519
doing uh here at Cornell is trying to

964
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,639
come up with economic decision tools

965
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,519
laying out some different climate

966
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,639
scenarios really giving Farmers the

967
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,880
tools to try to make this sort of

968
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,759
decision that probably they really have

969
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,640
to make personally based on their own

970
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,680
economics or their own Farm their own uh

971
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:13,920
personal um level of risk that they're

972
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,919
willing to take um and that kind of

973
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,880
thing so adaptation I've kind of alluded

974
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,599
to some of these there's all kinds of

975
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,280
things farmers can do um to deal with

976
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,280
climate change from fairly simple ones

977
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,680
new crops new varieties have more

978
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,839
Diversified Farms earlier planting dates

979
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:34,399
with earlier Springs changes in pruning

980
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,519
strategies uh obviously more better week

981
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,599
pest monitoring as we have news new

982
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,519
pests coming up increase irrigation

983
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,039
improving drainage animal facilities

984
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,920
improve the improve the cooling capacity

985
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,960
certainly for example a dairy barn being

986
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,000
built today that's a big long-term

987
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,760
investment could be a 50 to 100 Year

988
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,880
investment should not be built on the

989
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,640
specs of the old historical climate that

990
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,039
we know was not going to be here in the

991
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,719
century

992
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,800
so that kind of thing is how farmers can

993
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:07,078
adapt we do have this issue of equity

994
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
concerns I mean will small Family Farms

995
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,640
have that little bit of capital it might

996
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,679
take to make the adaptation that could

997
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,118
keep them in business or even open up an

998
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,838
opportunity for them and they might not

999
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,079
have that and uh so and also being

1000
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,639
having just access to the right

1001
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,920
information at the

1002
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,279
time um in all of these climate change

1003
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,200
assessments there's sort of

1004
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
um uh these three components that we

1005
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:35,078
think about we've got a climate Factor

1006
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,519
like drought okay or heat stress we've

1007
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,480
got an impact you know reduced yields or

1008
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:43,559
milk production Decline and then an

1009
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,480
adaptation uh new irrigation equipment

1010
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,838
that kind of thing but all of these you

1011
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,000
know we have we don't have certainty

1012
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,920
about any any of these um for example

1013
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
the climate factors we've got you know

1014
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,559
we're used to The Climate scientists

1015
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,079
um uh using provide their information

1016
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,960
with different levels of certainty so

1017
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,440
they say well we with the temperature

1018
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,880
projections we have a pretty high degree

1019
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,800
of certainty about that precipitation

1020
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,440
lower level of certainty but we also

1021
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,400
have different levels of certainty about

1022
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,838
the impacts and then our adaptation

1023
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,358
capacity so we have to keep those things

1024
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,119
in mind as well some impacts are very

1025
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,838
straightforward if you don't water a

1026
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,760
crop and doesn't get any water it's not

1027
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,838
going to do well some are much more

1028
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,079
subtle and complicated for example CO2

1029
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:26,639
effects and interactions with

1030
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,400
environmental stress and then there's

1031
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,318
the timing these things I mentioned are

1032
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,039
happening now today it's urgent if we're

1033
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:34,559
going to respond we need to be adapting

1034
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,559
now some are projections that uh late in

1035
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,358
the century like I mentioned maybe

1036
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,719
winter chilling requirements of some

1037
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:42,960
Long Winter Chill requirement Apple

1038
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,239
varieties by end of century might be

1039
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,838
getting on the edge well that's a later

1040
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,118
term thing so those kinds of things have

1041
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:51,400
to be kept in mind and then sometimes we

1042
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,559
have a very straightforward adaptation

1043
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,480
strategy but there's either not the

1044
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:56,400
money to do it the farmers don't have

1045
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,318
the money or we don't have the

1046
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
information to do

1047
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:02,279
Etc so we have to think about all of

1048
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,000
these things and in poisoning uh the

1049
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,720
farmers that we work with um to be

1050
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,239
prepared for this the state policy

1051
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,239
makers

1052
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,519
Etc okay my uh few minutes remaining I'm

1053
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,200
going to turn a little bit of attention

1054
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,440
to the other side of the coin and that

1055
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,879
is not adaptation and how Farmers might

1056
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
adapt to climate change but mitigation

1057
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,318
you might say becoming part of the

1058
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:27,838
solution reducing greenhouse gases on

1059
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:29,800
the farm and um

1060
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,119
role that I play in that and this is a

1061
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,839
laundry list of some fundamental um

1062
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,960
things that can be done on the farm a

1063
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,440
lot of these are the same kind of things

1064
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,318
we can do in our personal lives and

1065
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,639
reducing fossil fuel use Etc using more

1066
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:46,838
renewable energy fuel crops manure

1067
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,078
handling and storage is a big one um

1068
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:49,759
I'll mention some of these in a little

1069
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,039
more detail nitrogen fertilizer use

1070
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,960
efficiency I'll explain why that would

1071
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,599
be a big one up there and then so carbon

1072
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,880
sequestration some of you are probably

1073
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
familiar with what I'm talking about

1074
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,599
there so I'm going to talk about a few

1075
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,240
of these these issues of the other side

1076
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,039
of the coin so we'll hear I think a

1077
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,039
little bit more about this later in the

1078
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,838
term as well some of the other

1079
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,239
speakers certainly we have a lot of

1080
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,119
farmers um looking into this because it

1081
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,118
makes plenty of economic sense uh when

1082
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,240
turbines on um marginal parts of the

1083
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,760
property to supplement their own energy

1084
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,919
needs as energy costs go up uh Farmers

1085
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,960
exploring biofuel CRS either to support

1086
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,519
their own needs or get bofu uh markets

1087
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,480
that are opening up and while there's a

1088
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,480
lot of uh you know obviously you can

1089
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,440
have whole seminar series about biofuel

1090
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,639
crops and there have been some a lot of

1091
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,200
controversies and issues there's no

1092
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:42,838
question that you know compared to

1093
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,960
Bringing new carbon from deep in the

1094
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:46,400
earth and getting it up to the surface

1095
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,039
and then burning it off and now it's a

1096
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,358
part of our surface system for the long

1097
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,400
term there's a lot of advantages to

1098
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,279
working with cycling of carbon through

1099
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,318
plants burning the carbon from the

1100
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,440
plants but then having the plant suck it

1101
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,440
up things at least in that that

1102
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,039
cycle um you know was mentioned at the

1103
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,000
beginning I as some of you know I do a

1104
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,279
lot of work with soil so biology soil

1105
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,239
ecology and this is quite relevant I

1106
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,839
think so biological processes to the

1107
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,598
role that agriculture plays in all three

1108
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:20,960
of the big greenhouse gases we've got

1109
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:23,400
carbon dioxide n2o is nitrous oxide and

1110
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,960
methane CH4 these are the three biggest

1111
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,639
greenhouse gases uh three most important

1112
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,960
in terms of what's causing

1113
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:34,400
uh climate change and U CO2 emissions uh

1114
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,480
in terms of Agriculture a lot of it has

1115
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,280
to do with Organic Matter decomposition

1116
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,119
just aerobic carbon mineralization and

1117
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,240
when we talk about things like let's

1118
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,680
reduce tillage to sequester more carbon

1119
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,919
well when you till a soil you're ating

1120
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:51,799
the soil feeding lots of pumping lots of

1121
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,800
oxygen into the soil stimulates this

1122
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,760
process it actually Burns off that

1123
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,800
organic matter so fast that it doesn't

1124
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,319
really have time to do us much in terms

1125
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,519
of its beneficial effects on soil

1126
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,880
quality and soil Health just burning it

1127
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,719
right back up and putting it back up

1128
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,079
with CO2 so we don't want to over till

1129
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,719
um because of that uh so that's kind of

1130
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:14,280
where that one comes in nitrous oxide

1131
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:18,039
emissions uh this is sort of a a a

1132
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,839
diagrammatic way of laying out the um

1133
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:23,239
nitrogen mineralization cycle from biota

1134
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:26,558
or crop residue being converted to

1135
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,838
ammonium by U microbes then being

1136
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,599
converted to nitrate by other microbes

1137
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,358
and under anerobic conditions you can

1138
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,079
get

1139
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,880
denitrification back up to into

1140
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,800
completing the nitrogen cycle all of

1141
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,160
this soil microbial activity crucial to

1142
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,559
all of these what I wanted to point out

1143
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,960
with this graphic is that nitrous oxide

1144
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,880
is sort of a happen stance you might say

1145
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,559
offshoot of this very natural process

1146
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,880
but the more

1147
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,640
um nitrogen we put on either as ammonium

1148
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,838
nitrate synthetic

1149
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,920
fertilizer or the more manure we put on

1150
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,599
here we're going to crank this cycle

1151
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,880
more and more and more and the more we

1152
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,440
run through the cycle the more volume of

1153
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
nitrogen fertilizer we have going

1154
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,079
through this whether it's organic or

1155
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,519
inorganic the more nitrous oxide

1156
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,119
emissions so this is why nitrogen

1157
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,920
fertilizer use is probably the key uh

1158
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,800
reason why we're having exponential rise

1159
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,440
in nitrous oxide in the in the

1160
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,119
atmosphere so agriculture is a key a key

1161
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,639
player in that important greenhouse gas

1162
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,960
and finally me we all hear about the

1163
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,159
burping of cows right that's anerobic

1164
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,960
bacteria that's antigens who live in the

1165
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:38,519
gut of cows also those kind of bacteria

1166
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,440
live in rice uh anerobic conditions in

1167
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:41,838
wetlands and rice Patty fields and all

1168
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,960
of that so

1169
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,799
methanogenesis um in relation to

1170
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,559
agriculture both

1171
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,240
livestock um rice Patty production and

1172
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,480
other things like that is another

1173
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,078
important

1174
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,559
part this also methane emissions um from

1175
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,720
uh break down as well so tillage and

1176
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,559
soul health I already mentioned uh

1177
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:06,039
reducing tillage is one approach to

1178
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,839
increasing so carbon sequestration my

1179
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:13,279
current grad student sasco is working um

1180
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,799
on a very difficult problem of if

1181
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,559
farmers are going to begin trying to

1182
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,559
develop new accounting tools for keeping

1183
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,800
track of if they're going to reduce

1184
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,160
tillage are they really doing what they

1185
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,160
think they're doing and sequestering

1186
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:29,039
more carbon in their soils

1187
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,879
measure the carbon and soils cheaply

1188
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,440
cost

1189
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,559
effectively as those of you who have

1190
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,240
done a little of this kind of work you

1191
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,280
know you could take a room this size and

1192
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:39,558
you can probably spend a

1193
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,519
career getting Sol cores and measuring

1194
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,160
carbon and still not be sure you got it

1195
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,039
right so how do we make some

1196
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:48,358
guesstimates of Sol Carbon on a fairly

1197
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,960
big landscape Farm scale uh to begin do

1198
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:51,679
that doing that accounting and it's It's

1199
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,159
Tricky and there's a lot of compromises

1200
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:56,039
that have to be made but we're we and

1201
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:59,039
many others around the country are

1202
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:01,000
working on it um one thing in terms of

1203
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,079
you have to develop some strategic

1204
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,800
approaches to soil sampling U usually

1205
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,480
starts with developing some maps um and

1206
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,480
just characterizing and stratifying

1207
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,719
across major vegetation types and soil

1208
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,039
types of course as you might think about

1209
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:19,399
uh so developing that ideal sampling

1210
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:21,279
scheme um one problem with trying to get

1211
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,559
at the actual carbon sequestered install

1212
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,079
we actually have to have a bulk density

1213
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,960
measurement as well so we can't just

1214
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,640
measure carbon concentration from a soul

1215
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,838
core we have to get undisturbed cores to

1216
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:35,639
do BU density very labor intensive

1217
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:37,920
straightforward thing to do but um

1218
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,239
tricky and also we have to go to deeper

1219
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,639
depths to really know what's happening

1220
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,519
in the soil um so what we're really

1221
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,239
doing is developing geospatial models

1222
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,119
where we're coming up with uh some very

1223
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:51,838
cheap and expensive um uh things that we

1224
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,599
can measure like we're using uh visible

1225
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,000
to near infrared spectroscopy

1226
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,039
measurements which once you get the

1227
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,519
system going you can actually have a

1228
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,039
tractor mounted device with a uh a

1229
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,480
sickle that's kind of going down through

1230
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,558
the soil and flashing light in the soil

1231
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,000
getting reflectivity from that looking

1232
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:13,040
at the wavelength uh reflectivity and

1233
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,519
using that to estimate C carbon and

1234
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:18,558
developing models to predict so carbon

1235
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,119
based on very cheap easy methods like

1236
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,519
that um and to look at so carbon change

1237
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,280
in the future a farmer is really going

1238
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,280
to get paid in carbon markets for

1239
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,319
supressing carbon we also have to get

1240
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,400
into projections and all of that so a

1241
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:34,480
lot going on there

1242
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,200
um now to the story of nitrogen I

1243
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,760
already talked about the nitrous oxide

1244
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:44,000
emissions part of U um nitrogen

1245
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,200
fertilizer use so so we've all been

1246
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,719
hearing for many years about the

1247
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,480
importance of being efficient with our

1248
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,919
nitrogen use in terms of reducing

1249
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:57,000
nitrate pollutants into our groundwaters

1250
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,559
and um surface waters Etc and this is

1251
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,199
incentive to climate change concern

1252
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,079
because we have both nitrous oxide

1253
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:04,558
emissions and also synthetic nitrogen

1254
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,960
fertilizers if that's what you're using

1255
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,480
they're very energy intensive to

1256
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,880
manufactur many of them four to six tons

1257
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,400
of carbon emitted in the atmosphere or

1258
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,160
CO2 equivalents emitted in the

1259
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,480
atmosphere for ton of nitrogen

1260
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,879
manufactured so just buying your bag of

1261
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,318
nitrogen fertilizer um adds to your

1262
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,960
covered footprint I guess you can say of

1263
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:28,159
um a farm or a

1264
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,800
garden this is showing

1265
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,558
a table with looking at some different

1266
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:38,039
um components to a mixed Dairy crop

1267
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,559
system and the CO2 the nitrous oxide

1268
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,039
methane emissions everything from

1269
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,400
fertilizer use to manure management

1270
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,440
manure handling and decomposition one

1271
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,079
thing I wanted to point out is that as

1272
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,280
we often see it's not the CO2 emissions

1273
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,519
that are the big part of the carbon

1274
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,480
budget performed it's the nitrous oxide

1275
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,039
emissions so it's not the tractor

1276
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,199
driving and the gas back the tractor a

1277
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,039
lot of it has to do with nitrogen

1278
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,358
management so um important thing we

1279
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,719
terms of educating Farmers about

1280
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,440
Greenhouse CS a lot we can do in terms

1281
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,439
of nitrogen management going back to our

1282
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,838
legumes and

1283
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,880
recycling um par vaness as U and others

1284
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:18,279
at Cornell and I'm involved with looking

1285
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,838
at some of this for sweet corn

1286
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,680
developing new approaches to nitren

1287
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,400
model nitrogen management using soil

1288
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:28,078
models that take into account real time

1289
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,760
weather data being more efficient

1290
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,079
and let's not forget we have over 3

1291
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,400
million Acres of turf in New York state

1292
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,880
and a lot of that lawn is not the

1293
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,440
nitrogen is not managed very efficiently

1294
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,039
and so that's a big low hanging food in

1295
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,480
terms of educating homeowners about the

1296
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:45,480
importance of nitrogen

1297
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,440
GES should all recognize this

1298
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:54,720
picture um and U as I've often said in

1299
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,960
my propping systems ecology class I

1300
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,519
think this is really a big challenge for

1301
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,280
agricultural scientists of this Century

1302
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,199
in the past Century we' figured out how

1303
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,280
to decouple animal and Crop Production

1304
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:09,159
systems for economies of scale Etc it's

1305
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,000
been good for economics but we need to

1306
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:13,519
somehow come back and think about how to

1307
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,760
still maintain profits for Farmers keep

1308
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:19,519
up the economies but recouple and and

1309
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,680
begin to utilize these resources like

1310
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,679
Manu

1311
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:28,399
Etc anerobic digestors um are important

1312
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,199
one of the import Sol to greenhous gas

1313
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,599
mitigation on the farm and farmers are

1314
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,078
very interested in this thing it reduces

1315
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,838
their cost of production something a lot

1316
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,960
of interest

1317
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,119
Farmers so I mean our challenge is kind

1318
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,559
of moving towards a couple summary

1319
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,680
slides um first of

1320
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,119
all I think we have to get over the

1321
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,679
notion and we're really the first

1322
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,559
generation of people that have to do

1323
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,279
this the assumption that the past

1324
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,319
historical climate where we live is is

1325
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,359
what we should be basing our decisions

1326
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:58,000
on because that's really just not valid

1327
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:00,798
anymore a moving targ

1328
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,159
um so our this our generation is really

1329
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:04,119
going to be challenged to develop new

1330
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,039
approaches to environmental monitoring

1331
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:08,318
things like where are the insect Mass

1332
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,880
moving uh where is how is the climate

1333
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,719
change and where regionally what's

1334
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,358
happening we need a lot of these new

1335
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:16,118
decision tools it's not just enough to

1336
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:18,119
know that something's happening it's

1337
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,358
like if you're talking about a farmer

1338
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,000
making an investment in something to

1339
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:24,039
adap it's like when did they make that

1340
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,519
investment and how much did they invest

1341
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,079
so we need some tools to help them make

1342
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,679
those decisions

1343
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,039
and then there's a lot of things we can

1344
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,440
do and come up to come up with these

1345
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:36,960
win-win strategies for mitigation on the

1346
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,920
farm um and still uh U helping the

1347
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,240
bottom line for the farmers and really I

1348
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:45,240
think this there's a lot of U enthusi

1349
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:47,959
enthusiasm among Farmers for this and a

1350
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,399
lot lot we can do that I was just

1351
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,720
involved in leading every 10 years or so

1352
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,000
the land grant universities get together

1353
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,159
develop this thing called the science

1354
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,280
road map the future 10 years big ISS

1355
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:01,399
I was asked to lead a group of people

1356
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,960
around the country developing the

1357
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,119
climate change piece of that and just

1358
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,760
for what it's worth um some of the big

1359
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,318
research areas laid out of course

1360
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,960
there's some climate science issues

1361
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,039
better Regional

1362
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,838
downscaling um more weather-based

1363
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,759
decision support for Farmers another

1364
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:19,759
research area not surprisingly better

1365
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,960
models for weeds and pests particularly

1366
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,119
specialty crops which is horticulture

1367
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:30,119
right that's for specialty for special

1368
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:32,000
um everything soybean I guess um a very

1369
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,200
important one I think is economic

1370
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,798
assessments not just what the impacts

1371
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,598
might be but what are my cost to adapt

1372
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:42,079
information on economics all

1373
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,798
that decision science and decision

1374
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,559
support tools how do we really how do

1375
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:46,880
people really make those changes what

1376
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:49,079
makes people make certain kinds of

1377
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,240
decisions how do people change their

1378
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,680
behavior what do people need for

1379
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,959
decision

1380
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:56,960
support um some very modeling the more

1381
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,599
comple

1382
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,000
entire food shed networks and that kind

1383
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,640
of thing um various things we can think

1384
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,480
about a lot of these are fairly straight

1385
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,318
forward adaptation strategies breeding

1386
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,760
crops for more high temperature stress

1387
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:13,239
drought stress uh improve Water

1388
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,160
Management nonchemical

1389
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:18,239
options um we need these for the

1390
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,679
mitigation piece we need to come up with

1391
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:23,358
some new tools for Farmers to begin to

1392
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,239
be able to develop these greenhouse gas

1393
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:27,078
budgets for their Farms I don't think

1394
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:31,279
agriculture the long could be the only

1395
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:33,440
industry exempt from having to gradually

1396
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,319
eventually uh begin to work into part of

1397
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,679
their system having some information

1398
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:38,639
about what's happening with greenhous

1399
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:40,919
gas emissions in their operation whether

1400
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,199
it's a market opportunity for them or it

1401
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:47,440
has to do with simple monitoring

1402
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:49,399
Etc communication and of course policy

1403
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,280
issues so these were just what a group

1404
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,720
of people around the US group of

1405
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,240
scientists came up with some B issues

1406
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:57,679
I've got a full report anybody's

1407
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:59,558
interested in that

1408
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,318
so I think that's it I'll stop here

1409
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,680
there's a bunch of people this is just a

1410
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:05,920
partial list of people I've worked with

1411
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,960
for a lot of this I did want to mention

1412
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,240
here's some funders Northeast s has

1413
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,199
funded a lot of this work in the isera

1414
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,239
organization as well as Cornell these

1415
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,879
websites Cornell has a climate change

1416
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,078
website if you very simple to remember

1417
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,039
climate change. cornell.edu take a look

1418
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,480
at that climate farming. org has a lot

1419
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:26,798
of PowerPoint slides on some of the

1420
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,480
stuff I talked about

1421
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:29,519
this is that Northeast climate impacts

1422
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,599
assessment

1423
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:35,920
report this sap 43 is the most recent US

1424
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,280
national assessment I co-author the

1425
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,838
agriculture chapter you get that there

1426
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,079
and then the intergovernmental panel on

1427
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:47,119
climate change the you know the the main

1428
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:50,440
source of all climate change stuff

1429
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,480
ipccc to get to that website so I'll

1430
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,480
stop there and take a few minutes for

1431
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,480
questions

1432
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,400
Geneva first since they're farther away

1433
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,159
Geneva da

1434
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,838
yeah have to look at Geneva before you

1435
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:12,838
can answer the

1436
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:19,279
question that they if you if when you if

1437
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,480
you try to couple back animal emiss

1438
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,240
animal waste and fertility you run into

1439
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,199
the phosphorus problem right yeah that

1440
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:31,159
that that there's much

1441
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:33,279
phosphorus need cows to produce manure

1442
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:34,519
with less phosphorus and more nitrogen

1443
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,960
yeah so we just need the dairy

1444
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:39,119
scientists to come up with some new kind

1445
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,599
of cow or a new uh no I don't know yeah

1446
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,280
that that's a big challenge but I think

1447
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:46,200
you know the um what we really need are

1448
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,359
um some creative you know I think it's

1449
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,439
it's there's that's just one of the

1450
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:51,199
stumbling blocks yeah another big one

1451
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,119
that's a very big one and the other big

1452
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,558
one is just the bulk of the material you

1453
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,440
know and moving all that bulk around and

1454
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,039
so I think for those those two big big

1455
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,200
challenges um that's what the guys in

1456
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,440
this room are going to figure out and

1457
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,159
the animal scientists are going to

1458
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,119
figure out I mean I think one thing is

1459
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:09,000
you know creating incentives that would

1460
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:10,760
make it um create opportunities for

1461
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,199
business entrepreneurs who think they've

1462
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,960
got some solution to those things

1463
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:17,318
whether it's some U minimal level of

1464
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,280
processing to get resolve some of these

1465
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:23,719
things or new ways of handling uh things

1466
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,200
or or some other strategies but

1467
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:28,879
um could also be you know the degree to

1468
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,318
which manure is just integrated with

1469
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,200
other parts of the system but I don't

1470
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,000
have the answer it's you're right it's a

1471
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:37,480
big

1472
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,480
challenge um yes

1473
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:45,038
so other questions from

1474
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,240
Geneva I see some hands here yeah yeah

1475
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:47,400
actually that kind of involves my

1476
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,078
question as well I've been getting more

1477
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,559
and more interested in da systems and

1478
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,880
one thing that I've kind of seen is that

1479
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,400
it's not necessarily that we don't have

1480
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,358
the technology or the people that can

1481
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,760
figure it that we don't have the

1482
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,719
financial backing or the policies in

1483
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,599
place I mean you could design manure

1484
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:07,199
digestors that can blize off nitrogen

1485
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:09,680
precipitate out phosphorus yeah and

1486
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,598
you're done I mean it can't be that hard

1487
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,759
you just mix Limestone and drop raise

1488
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,000
the ph and phosphorous precipitates all

1489
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,200
that stuff but and even with the uh

1490
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,199
manure digestors where they're

1491
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,159
generating electricity on

1492
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:24,439
Farm they're selling that electricity

1493
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:27,759
back to the Grid at 4 cents a kilowatt

1494
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:31,039
hour and they have to buy at 13 cents

1495
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,880
yeah so it doesn't make any sense for a

1496
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:36,280
Dairy Farmer to install uh you know one

1497
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:39,480
of these turbines when they're losing

1498
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,599
eight cents per kilowatt hour right so

1499
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,240
you know when I talked to the Dairy

1500
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:43,920
Farmers that they get really frustrated

1501
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,439
with that and understandably so I think

1502
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,760
that you know if we're going to get

1503
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:53,119
serious we need politicians we need

1504
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,160
policy support them yeah I mean if it do

1505
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,760
to give you a little bit of

1506
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,798
encouragement for it's worth on this uh

1507
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,119
New York State climate Action

1508
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,519
Council which is going directly to the

1509
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,519
governor's office and and and there's

1510
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,239
you know a whole group of people from

1511
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,719
scientists as well as non-scientists

1512
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:10,558
involved in developing policy

1513
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,038
recommendations and addressing issues

1514
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,400
like what you just mentioned are you

1515
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:16,000
know certainly in there as we we need

1516
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,599
you know we need to come up with some of

1517
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,280
these um uh new sorts of policies and

1518
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,880
the anerobic digestors themselves I mean

1519
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,079
farmers are really Cho in the bit to get

1520
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,280
those because there's a lot of benefit

1521
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:26,920
to them they but there's problems with

1522
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,160
their just high cost right now it's

1523
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,519
matter of scale of production and maybe

1524
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,000
just engineering coming up with new new

1525
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,239
lower cost versions or developing co-ops

1526
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,920
or small family farms and share anic

1527
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,358
digest so but a lot of those things I

1528
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,119
can what it's worth anyway there's

1529
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:44,519
people who are talking about those

1530
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,680
things in New York state and trying to

1531
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,199
get the word up to chain of command to

1532
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:50,879
begin doing something about it there's

1533
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:53,598
always like other entities that going to

1534
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,200
work against you on some of those things

1535
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,000
so is there a question um you have of

1536
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,399
course focused on the effects of climate

1537
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,639
on Plants but what about the effects of

1538
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,280
plants on climate you touched on

1539
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:09,400
mitigation sequesteration right what do

1540
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,160
you think is the realistic Prospect for

1541
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,358
aforestation or other ways of

1542
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,558
sequester yeah so the question is you

1543
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:20,838
know will a forestation sort of help us

1544
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,079
um resolve some of this and I think it's

1545
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:24,838
you know really important part of the

1546
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,720
portfolio and and one thing we're going

1547
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:29,199
back to this climate action so one thing

1548
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,879
we're thinking about is this you know

1549
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:33,279
something like 90% of the Timberland in

1550
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,318
New York state is privately owned and uh

1551
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,079
one thing we would like to from a

1552
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:38,719
climate change perspective what you'd

1553
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:41,960
like to see as incentives for those who

1554
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,919
have trees not to be cutting them down

1555
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,679
um because that's just going to be a

1556
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,240
major carbon loss to the system so

1557
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,318
maintaining even just the carbon stocks

1558
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:53,038
we have in our forest separate from A4

1559
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,279
station um is important there have been

1560
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,799
you know back of the envelope

1561
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,640
calculations done on how many of land

1562
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,440
would it take uh how much new tree

1563
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:04,118
planting would we have to do per year

1564
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,559
globally to keep up with the CO2

1565
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:08,640
emissions projected and it's it's it's

1566
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,519
out of sight and you know we're not

1567
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,480
going to solve the problem that way just

1568
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:13,639
like we're not going to solve the

1569
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,480
problem by substituting some biofuels

1570
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:18,879
fossil fuels but it could certainly be

1571
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,280
part of the portfolio of what we what we

1572
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,240
can do and you know trees at least can

1573
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,000
buy us some time if you have a 50 year

1574
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,199
100 year then window sequestration of

1575
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,519
carbon uh eventually although that that

1576
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,000
carbon may end up decomposing and going

1577
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,719
back to the atmosphere 100 years from

1578
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,838
now you've saved ourselves maybe the

1579
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:38,558
time it takes to come up with new energy

1580
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,119
sources and all that

1581
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,920
so and then there's the albo effect you

1582
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,559
plant trees it produces Al it may result

1583
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,760
in in heating yeah yeah so there that's

1584
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,599
very important yeah glad you mentioned

1585
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,079
that so have vegetation cover has a big

1586
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,798
uh big effect different types of

1587
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,599
vegetation cover have effects on albo

1588
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:00,199
and 's few people in the country looking

1589
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,160
at that who do like remote sensing work

1590
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:06,199
and all of that it's pretty pretty

1591
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:08,558
dramatic so all that's important so

1592
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:10,598
there is a in fact we're looking to hire

1593
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,280
a Cornell and new terrest biogeochemist

1594
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,920
who would really look Focus be kind of

1595
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,480
an ecologist type person but Focus very

1596
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,559
much on vegetation impacts on climate so

1597
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,199
looking to hiring like

1598
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:27,519
that a question about the transpiration

1599
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:30,279
data um one of the major drivers

1600
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,719
transation is solar radiation so I'm

1601
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,160
wondering is solar radiation levels are

1602
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:35,959
they going expect to stay the same or is

1603
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,759
it going to be less radiation with maybe

1604
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,280
more moisture in the atmosphere more

1605
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:45,440
Cloud levels or well the solar radiation

1606
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,960
I think in general we the assumption is

1607
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,599
you know the Sol radiation is not going

1608
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,880
to change dramatically in the next 100

1609
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,318
years um but there is uh there's some

1610
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,358
discussion in the literature of a

1611
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:59,400
so-called global dimming phenomenon

1612
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:01,838
which um refers to the notion that it

1613
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,599
kind of comes from this notion that as

1614
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,838
the planet Heats in general more of the

1615
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,400
water that's on the surface of the

1616
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:10,558
planet does get up into the air above as

1617
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,599
water vapor and then this could mean you

1618
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,200
know increases in cloud cover greater

1619
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:17,400
humidity slightly diminishing um solar

1620
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,759
incoming solar radiation but all of that

1621
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,039
has to do but at the same time the air

1622
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,720
temperature is going up so it has a

1623
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:23,480
higher water holding capacity before you

1624
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:24,719
actually get that dimming effect and

1625
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,519
make a long story short you can't

1626
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:30,879
project that very well

1627
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:32,400
so um but there's uh so anyway so there

1628
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,400
could be some of that phenomenon I mean

1629
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,680
the climate models and the the various

1630
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,400
types of climate models handle cloud

1631
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:40,318
cover differently and and there's a

1632
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,039
range of some variability in how they

1633
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:47,519
handle that but um it's it's it's still

1634
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,440
within the envelope of the projections I

1635
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,358
showed you U those climate models all

1636
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,159
sort of falling in place so although it

1637
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,598
creates a you know creates some of our

1638
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:58,558
variability and what we project in the

1639
01:02:54,599 --> 01:03:00,200
future I think we um have accounted for

1640
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,359
the cloud cover as well as we can at

1641
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:05,358
this point so but we're certainly not

1642
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:08,000
expecting if it's the question is uh our

1643
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,519
sunspots are something that save us uh

1644
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,039
that's really very very

1645
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,400
optimistic um you know there are sun

1646
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:15,559
activity things that have caused these

1647
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,960
interglacial cycles and you'll sometimes

1648
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,480
see in the news someone coming out

1649
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,240
saying oh it's sunspots and they're

1650
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,960
talking about these interglacial cycles

1651
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,118
and there's no indication that all of a

1652
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,720
sudden the inter what takes you know we

1653
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:31,079
are on our way the next uh Ice Age give

1654
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:32,239
us 30 40,000 years um so but in the

1655
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:34,920
meantime in the next 100 years we're

1656
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:38,118
going to double where we're at now so

1657
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,000
but the the moisture in the air Jonathan

1658
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:42,400
do you have anything to add on that

1659
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,400
because I don't even look I

1660
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,318
cover yeah so on the on the first graph

1661
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,480
you showed it looks like there's a

1662
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:51,239
pretty predictable rise and fall in

1663
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,440
temperature every 100,00 years or so so

1664
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:54,078
are there is there a lot of work going

1665
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,159
into studying you know it's kind of like

1666
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:59,480
a tipping bucket what are the that all

1667
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,399
of a sudden precipitate the decline and

1668
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,798
are we just shortening that time period

1669
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,278
before we hit that that trigger that

1670
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:08,239
starts to bring the other way are we

1671
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:10,039
just condensing the cycle or yeah well I

1672
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,719
think I think why don't you I would say

1673
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:13,760
I could I

1674
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:15,278
I think I know the answer that question

1675
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,400
but you had to save that for our Dayan

1676
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:20,639
as the climate scientist but um you know

1677
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,200
I think th those those longterm Cycles

1678
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,159
have been well studied I think the

1679
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,558
climate scientists think they've got a

1680
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,679
handle on it has to do with planetary

1681
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,599
movements and and Sun activity and

1682
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,239
things like that and there is also a

1683
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,000
feed forward and feed back and forth

1684
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:35,919
between CO2 and temperature just like

1685
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,798
we're seeing now as the temperature

1686
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,559
begins to rise due to the rise in CO2

1687
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,239
caused by human activity now we're

1688
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,760
seeing more CO2 rise because we're

1689
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,558
melting

1690
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,640
permafrost that's releasing more

1691
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,880
greenhouse gases Etc so that's why those

1692
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,118
two coincide feed on each other back and

1693
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,200
forth so it creates those Cycles um but

1694
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,400
I don't think there's any evidence that

1695
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:58,239
we're condensing that cycle I think

1696
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,680
those are that cycle is due to

1697
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:02,719
well-known forcing factors that are in

1698
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:04,798
the global General circulation models

1699
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:10,318
that they use today and they operate on

1700
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:12,159
these 20 30,000 40,000 year Cycles um

1701
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,119
and all we're expecting now is that

1702
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,960
we're pumping a bunch of greenhouse

1703
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,119
gases sort of out of nowhere out of deep

1704
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,480
in the earth unexpectedly and we're just

1705
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,200
going to bump the temperature up rapidly

1706
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,719
and that St that same driving force

1707
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,399
bring us towards an ice age is going to

1708
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,879
continue but it's going to be starting

1709
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,599
at a higher place because of if you see

1710
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,920
what I'm saying so I don't think there's

1711
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,200
a thought that the glacial interg

1712
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,798
glacial periods are condensing it's more

1713
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:40,159
just we're just we're putting a big peak

1714
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:43,079
on the temperature right now that that

1715
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:43,078
cycle is working

1716
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:47,798
against any other questions from

1717
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,359
Geneva anybody else

1718
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:59,960
here question

1719
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:02,199
one one more question uh what you

1720
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,400
haven't mentioned and and there's been

1721
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:06,960
some pretty spectacular movies and

1722
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,079
things like this about the effects of

1723
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,960
global ocean

1724
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:15,640
circulation and I mean if the Gulf

1725
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:18,400
Stream slows down uh England cools off a

1726
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:21,358
lot right and so I'm just curious as to

1727
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,440
where your your thoughts are on those

1728
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,519
kinds of issues yeah well there's

1729
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,039
there's sort of a a range of uh various

1730
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:30,079
projections about what climate change

1731
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:32,960
might do that are I would put them in

1732
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,559
the category of possible but not you

1733
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,318
know not not things that we feel highly

1734
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,240
confident about but not not not just

1735
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,599
crazy ideas they're within the realm of

1736
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,000
possibility based on what we know and

1737
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,440
that's certainly one of them that a

1738
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,880
place like England could actually get

1739
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,960
colder because the the Gulf Stream is is

1740
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,680
affected which brings this warmer these

1741
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,278
warmer ocean waters to it um today and

1742
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,838
again the you know could I would be

1743
01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:00,278
giving sort of an amateure explanation

1744
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,719
of it where whereas uh the climate

1745
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:04,559
scientists coming in later in the

1746
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:06,358
semester to give more detailed answer

1747
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,039
but that's that's a a real phenomenon

1748
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:10,719
real possibility um same thing we know

1749
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,079
that the sea level rise I didn't get

1750
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,358
into that because it doesn't affect our

1751
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,400
agriculture in New York state that

1752
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,798
dramatically but we've got dramatic sea

1753
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,960
level rise is a real phenomenon we're

1754
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,719
seeing today you know around for example

1755
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,720
New York City harbard it's gone up about

1756
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:25,838
15 Ines in the last 50 60 years expected

1757
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:27,959
to continue even just with thermal

1758
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,519
expansion just as the as the Seas get

1759
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,639
warmer thermal expansion causes much of

1760
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:34,880
that not even counting deal melting and

1761
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,440
all that but it could get it could be

1762
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,599
four or five times worse than that if

1763
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:43,039
this Greenland ice shelf rapidly melts

1764
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:48,119
which there's it's that's another thing

1765
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:51,000
that is not completely uh uh out of the

1766
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:53,720
realm of possibility but is less certain

1767
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,519
so things could be much more

1768
01:07:53,719 --> 01:08:00,159
dramatic than um what I've gotten into

1769
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:03,119
so yes those are real things but just

1770
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,759
things um you know it depends on whether

1771
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,039
you're not for Mr C whether you lose

1772
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,278
sleep or you're just counting on

1773
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:10,319
something to save us um so I'm not I

1774
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:12,920
don't I don't lose sleep about about

1775
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,920
England getting

1776
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:19,198
colder all right let's thank
