1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,339
caring for your garden really strikes at

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,129
the five habits of the heart and it's

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:14,169
good to talk about those again because

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,179
people associate food with their lives

5
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,009
and you have to care for people's lives

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:19,929
because people's lives are important

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,260
caring for the lives of the community

8
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:25,660
it's also embedded in a larger goal of

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,910
social justice and social change that

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,000
food justice efforts seek to address

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,960
food justice is about actually providing

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,210
the foods that are historically

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,120
culturally appropriate for the culture

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,948
it's Kevin oh I love cabbage I love yeah

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,689
that's spicy cabbage my mom makes it

16
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:42,908
sound like I'm wrong really she was like

17
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,079
chicken broth instead of water put the

18
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,878
cabbage in there they like whole bunch

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,189
of red peppers question about the kind

20
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:51,369
of stuff and just missed the ball to the

21
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:52,568
board all the way down that's it but her

22
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,338
spicy cabbage cooked down it's like

23
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:57,120
always like my friends come over for

24
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:59,259
when I come home like it's really good

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,849
so food security is just about getting

26
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,349
food to a community so just getting

27
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,670
nutritious food to a community that's

28
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,349
really what it's about I mean we have

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,670
food everywhere I can go back to the

30
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,228
bodega right here on the corner and get

31
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,210
food but then the questions that the

32
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:12,908
food is not healthy

33
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,530
will you see foods like corn peas squash

34
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,270
like Fuji regular see in the grocery

35
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,090
store it's cool to be able to grow them

36
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:20,468
and then actually and actually you don't

37
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,789
have to force people to eat foods they

38
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:22,750
don't want to eat like who's they

39
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,608
already see in the grocery stores

40
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,868
because once you show them that they can

41
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:28,149
grow these kind of foods in their

42
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,468
neighborhoods or where they're located

43
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,879
then they don't they can still go to the

44
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:32,228
grocery store but learn about all their

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,759
food from the grocery store and the

46
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:35,649
purpose of community gardens is to

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,968
provide a portion of food to communities

48
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,399
it's not gonna supply the entire

49
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:40,809
community foods until it grows more but

50
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,000
the small space that there is it's an

51
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,259
opportunity to expose people to more

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,498
nutritious foods that they grow

53
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,498
themselves

54
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,859
you
