1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,419
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,500
University Thank You Vera Tim for that

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:09,449
sensitive question so I will not be

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,160
talking about it that then today and

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:15,119
we'll be talking about Sorrell health

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,960
which is another very exciting topic and

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm gonna try to focus on sort of bigger

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,640
picture issues because I believe that we

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,189
need to understand that in order to be

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,368
able to think about how we can sort of

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,050
address some of the current issues so

12
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:32,399
just as a quick introduction and you

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,739
know we've talked about soil health in

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,870
the past so I'm not gonna go down too

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,269
far but it basically relates to

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,399
functioning of the soil the capacity to

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,859
function kind of like with human health

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,480
it's an it's an equivalent and so some

19
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,390
of these functions include supporting

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,089
plant growth and thereby crops some of

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,140
this being an excellent habitat for

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,059
organisms being in a hydrological and

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,049
environmental buffer things like that

24
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:04,018
okay and I often like to start out with

25
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,030
this diagram that sort of shows how we

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,330
as humans are impacted by soil health

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,030
through maybe two major pathways one is

28
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,769
sort of the agriculture nutrition and

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,530
the other one is more the ecosystem

30
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:19,920
services and the environmental impacts

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,159
issues like climate change or water

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,590
quality etc today I want to explore a

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,770
little bit more how we as humans are

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:33,750
also impacting soil health so the arrow

35
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:35,250
going the other way so the other thing

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,890
that's been really exciting about soil

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,290
health and we started a major effort

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,219
here at Cornell with Georgia Bobby and

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,070
Dave wolf in about 18 years ago I think

40
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,769
it was and what it brought together is

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:52,859
is the the three major supporting

42
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,109
disciplines in soil science and so ended

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,629
up working with so chemists worked with

44
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:00,299
Murray McBride and Hannah and people

45
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:03,359
like that with Janice T's and now Dan

46
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,520
Buckley they both and Georgia Bobby and

47
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,580
no I really come out of the physical

48
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,639
area but one of the ideas initially was

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,590
to say well we really did a very good

50
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,389
job with nutrients in pH or the

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,180
the chemical aspects but the physical

52
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,759
and biological aspects are not very well

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,890
addressed so that brought us to

54
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,348
developing a soil health test basically

55
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,049
sort of a standard test that's made up

56
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:30,780
of chemical physical and biological

57
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,810
indicators and these were selected based

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,989
on their general utility cost and and

59
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,640
all that and we're now in the soil

60
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,250
health lab in this building we're now

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,378
processing several thousands of samples

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,590
annually from basically all over the

63
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:49,949
world and it has sort of become one of

64
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,650
the standards for soil health assessment

65
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:54,238
and and we've tweaked it a little bit

66
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,920
over the years but they've largely held

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,128
up as being really good indicators now

68
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,589
show you some results later on but I

69
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:04,229
want to start at a very foundational

70
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,729
level first that's really what soils

71
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:12,268
made up what what makes up soils and and

72
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:14,429
there's really a few very basic

73
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,819
ingredients that make soil so one is the

74
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:22,799
minerals typically weathered geological

75
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:25,078
material biological material and then

76
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,689
water air and Sun as the other major

77
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,840
ingredients and that basically the water

78
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,299
dissolves the mineral of the crystals

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,989
and and and and dissolves the minerals

80
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:40,139
makes nutrients available some of those

81
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,870
nutrients are biologically hydrogen or

82
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,879
lead right you need water air and Sun in

83
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,549
carbon dioxide you need oxygen need

84
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,769
water to grow plants and to have the

85
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,139
plans to feed other organisms etc etc

86
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,340
and let's see sort of what on earth at

87
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,989
least makes the soils very special and

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:03,000
we end up with this sort of accumulation

89
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,280
of carbon and minerals so in the natural

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,068
soil formation this is really a very

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,318
efficient system most of the minerals

92
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:13,048
that are being dissolved by chemical

93
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,479
weathering are being absorbed through

94
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,699
roots by plants and then feed other

95
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,819
organisms okay so most of the minerals

96
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,370
dissolved end up actually in some type

97
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,680
of organic material if they're not being

98
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,370
absorbed by the soil but very low loss

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,500
great so the organics the carbon eater

100
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:39,519
builds up in the soil especially here

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,360
you see that soil or they're being

102
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,310
recycled

103
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,288
you know either directly plant material

104
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,949
being recycled or recycled through some

105
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:49,930
other organism okay but in natural

106
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,050
system you basically have an

107
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,110
accumulation over time of minerals and

108
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,600
carbon in the organic matter right and

109
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,930
that sort of creates a you might say a

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,439
bank account of stored energy and

111
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:09,430
minerals so an example of a highly

112
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,680
successful type of soil health formation

113
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,509
are these Pyrrha glacial lusts soils

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,240
under grassland vegetation which you

115
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,909
find in sort of lights now you know most

116
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,360
of the Corn Belt lusts Orioles are wind

117
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,789
derived very fresh material from recent

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,939
glaciation grassland soils are very

119
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:30,519
efficient with capturing the energy from

120
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:33,069
the Sun and the water and then pumping a

121
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,288
lot of carbon into that soil so you get

122
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,529
these very deep mala seeds that are

123
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:42,550
really you know fantastic as a success

124
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:45,369
story in terms and around the world we

125
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,860
have a lot of similar soils like that we

126
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,889
know the soils here you know we think of

127
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,699
Iowa and places like that but you know

128
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,889
China and Ukraine Central Europe even in

129
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:58,900
South America you have similar soils and

130
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,180
believe me a lot of wars have been

131
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,379
fought over controlling those kind of

132
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,180
lands because they are the most

133
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:09,370
productive soils so if you look at so

134
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,189
this accumulation of minerals and carbon

135
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,699
right and so here the carbon this is

136
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:18,908
organic sea and the minerals I just show

137
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,379
the phosphorus at least our five soils

138
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:23,288
in in Indiana it's there both of

139
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,908
publication I like to do some back of

140
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:27,370
the envelope calculations of what does

141
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:29,620
this really mean what's in those soils

142
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,259
well there's about 3,000 kilograms of

143
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,620
phosphorus per hectare in the in the top

144
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,120
foot of those soils in terms of

145
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,848
phosphorus that's either in organic form

146
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,360
or some other non crystalline absorb

147
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,879
form

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,240
and so for the entire route sound it may

149
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:50,079
be about double when you think of a corn

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,840
and seasonal corn plant requires about

151
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,959
forty to fifty kilograms so you can

152
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,750
think about this being a bank of

153
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,299
minerals that you can draw out of no you

154
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,949
have a good hundred years maybe that you

155
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,810
could draw out of that okay not that we

156
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,329
necessarily want to do that but it's

157
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,980
it's there right so that's why these

158
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:13,810
soils are productive and have been

159
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,689
relatively productive so as opposed to

160
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,149
those soils we also have what we might

161
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:22,899
call marginally successful soil health

162
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:24,370
formation and so this is a Cecil soil

163
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:28,120
from the southeast in the United States

164
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,889
and most of the minerals have already

165
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,319
been leached out because these are old

166
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:36,039
soils the remaining minerals are a lot

167
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,469
of iron and aluminum oxides the they

168
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,090
were forests arrived so not that much

169
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,120
organic matter and in fact a lot of it

170
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:46,359
has been lost through erosion and all

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,250
that so this is a nut soil and so you

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,490
can map that then you look at a picture

173
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,649
like that EC okay we see that most of

174
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,500
these soils that have a lot of

175
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,689
phosphorus tend to be in these P really

176
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,810
show more northern areas where there's

177
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:04,779
more organic matter in the soil and and

178
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,060
much poorer in the in the southern areas

179
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,939
with the exception of the Mississippi

180
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,410
River Valley but of course that's the

181
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,519
good stuff that comes down the river

182
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:17,800
right so we'll come back to that later

183
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,529
so in this of course you can you can

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,150
upscale that to a global level we tend

185
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,919
to be blessed with very good soils in

186
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,779
this part of the world and most of the

187
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,780
rest of the world has soils more like

188
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:33,490
this is a some soils from Brazil and so

189
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,709
you know a lot of not a lot of useful

190
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,560
nutrients also be low organic matter

191
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,210
content so that's when you have a

192
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,459
situation where you can maybe get a

193
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,780
couple of years of crop production out

194
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,330
of them and then you have to abandon the

195
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,879
land which kind of stimulated this whole

196
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,960
idea of shifting cultivation to three

197
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,590
years of crops

198
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,269
30 40 years of putting it back

199
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,690
letting the natural searle forming

200
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,789
processes build a little bit of

201
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,590
fertility and then you have another two

202
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:05,620
or three years right so it's very

203
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:09,850
different than the situation in say the

204
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Midwest so and of course we started to

205
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,480
develop these soils agriculture

206
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,049
development so we remove the service

207
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,360
vegetation and so that's some of the

208
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:21,279
carbon but then also of course we till

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,590
the soil we stimulate organic matter

210
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,299
decomposition which is great because it

211
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,830
releases the nutrients but it's not so

212
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:30,429
great because you're basically drawing

213
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,650
out of your bank accounts right and in

214
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,859
addition we have this physical

215
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:38,620
degradation of the soil and so your

216
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,120
erosion and all that so not only are you

217
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,590
kind of burning up the organic matter

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,810
using the nutrients some of them are

219
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,690
actually physically removed off your

220
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:49,599
field and ghost's elsewhere okay and

221
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,970
this is much more of a problem in hotter

222
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,550
climates or forced derived soils that

223
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,570
basically aren't that good to start out

224
00:09:54,549 --> 00:10:00,579
with okay so and these soils because

225
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,350
we're growing plants typically when

226
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,500
we're growing crops a lot of times its

227
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,930
annual plants and so a large part of the

228
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,899
year there's no active plant growth and

229
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:13,239
the snow forming processes are not so

230
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:16,120
basically we're not using the basic

231
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,159
resources of water Sun and minerals as

232
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,490
sufficiently and we have a lot more

233
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,309
losses right much of the minerals and

234
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,950
energy because of agriculture we removed

235
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:29,949
them we typically harvest you know fifty

236
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,800
to sixty percent of the biomass and even

237
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,150
more of the minerals we're recycling a

238
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,139
little bit through residues or maybe

239
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:39,819
manures but a lot of it gets lost and so

240
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,090
we're effectively mining these soils

241
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,150
right that's what I'd recorder has done

242
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,759
and it's results in nutrient and carbon

243
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:53,049
depletion and like I said basically the

244
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:55,929
need for this continuous production so

245
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,519
here's some data from Kirsten quartz and

246
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,049
many of you know her she's in the in the

247
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,179
audience is sitting right there she

248
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:04,419
manages the soil health lab there's also

249
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:06,399
working on my master's program with

250
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:07,328
Rebecca Schneider and Steve Morreale

251
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,980
miner

252
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:15,638
vizor and what she has done is sampled

253
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,079
some soils natural soils as much as

254
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,499
possible Prairie soils in the Western

255
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:22,479
Corn Belt and then sampling Co sampling

256
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:24,519
at agricultural sites that were right

257
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,589
nearby kind of a site by side comparison

258
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,178
and this is some very preliminary data

259
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,939
she's doing a lot of sort of health

260
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:33,548
analyses this is this organic matter and

261
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:35,618
it shows how much loss of organic matter

262
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:38,499
that's been in an area that's been in

263
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:41,709
production maybe for less than 150 years

264
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:44,230
okay so often you know two three four

265
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:46,088
percent organic matter losses and this

266
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,459
project is in the context of some work

267
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:51,309
in China that Rebecca and Steve started

268
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:53,469
in the area northwestern China where we

269
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:56,169
in a way have a similar ecological

270
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,629
agricultural environment but many more

271
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:01,448
years of intensive land degradation

272
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:04,928
it's really quite extreme and dustbowl

273
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:08,308
like okay so that brings me to this

274
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:11,948
issue of the geography and the history

275
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:15,519
part of my thinking started a few years

276
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:17,378
ago when I'll refine who got her

277
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,709
master's degree with indeed Martinez and

278
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:23,319
then worked for me for a year or two or

279
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,808
whatever and so obvious very very smart

280
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:27,428
lady and so I asked her to do some

281
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:29,649
statistical analysis so she did some

282
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:32,948
multivariate work and all that but also

283
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,928
asked her to do a regional comparison of

284
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:36,458
the soils in our soil health database

285
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:39,399
from the many thousands of samples that

286
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:41,618
we had had analyzed and compared those

287
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,808
three regions the Midwest and

288
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:50,079
mid-atlantic and and so based on what I

289
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:51,519
just said about soil development and and

290
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,159
why some soils are better than other

291
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,860
ones which one would you expect to have

292
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,499
the best results in terms of soil health

293
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,649
right obviously you would say yeah these

294
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:04,329
Molly soils very glacial mon-sol's okay

295
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,188
well it's good I didn't bet any money on

296
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:07,659
that because it turned out to be not the

297
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:11,230
case

298
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:13,419
okay this is here these are for fiscal

299
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,879
indicators agriculture AgrAbility

300
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,919
available water capacity and penetration

301
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,409
resistance is a hardness indicator and

302
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,809
for a biological indicators organic

303
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:24,669
matter active carbon protein and

304
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:28,089
respiration so organic matter is a

305
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:30,039
standard indicator active carbon

306
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,639
something that we worked on with a wolf

307
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,919
is an labile carbon indicator protein of

308
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,189
course is protein which honesty's on

309
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,929
that respiration as well and so what you

310
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,970
see so where it's green that means that

311
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,969
that region has statistically higher or

312
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,170
makes more favorable numbers okay so you

313
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,779
see that the more theast in the

314
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:53,159
mid-atlantic tended to have the best

315
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:55,539
physical and biological conditions

316
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,620
better than the Midwest the only one

317
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:58,419
that was good in the Midwest was

318
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,759
available water capacity which has more

319
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,189
to do but the dominant textural class

320
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,830
which is more silt loam and silty clay

321
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,100
loam so this is surprising you look at

322
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,230
organic matter the Midwest had about 3%

323
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,580
and all along the East Coast had about

324
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,990
four percent that's one percent

325
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,379
difference in organic man that's a lot

326
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,560
okay the protein content was about

327
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,960
double only the East Coast so this is

328
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,519
really surprising so why is that why

329
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,950
would you have that because because

330
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,439
conventional theory says it should be

331
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,210
much better okay so but when you think

332
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,390
about this now these were the samples

333
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,680
that came into our lab so not a

334
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,870
stratified sampling scheme or whatever

335
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,019
just whatever came so when you think

336
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:45,100
about it what comes into a lab from the

337
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:47,439
Midwest is it's it's associated with

338
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,930
corn and soybean row crop production

339
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,050
what comes into our lab from East Coast

340
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:57,069
it's more livestock more perennial crops

341
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:58,959
like alfalfa more organic farms okay so

342
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,510
but this is definitely surprising that

343
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,090
soil health is basically better along

344
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,580
the east coast then in the central part

345
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,110
so that really kind of brought me to

346
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,690
think about this spatial dimension of

347
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,460
soil health right so we tend to think of

348
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,040
soil health and sort of forming factors

349
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,019
as something that happens in situ right

350
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,120
but as it turns out that's a huge

351
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,100
spatial dimension to that and that's

352
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,980
both natural

353
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,050
and anthropogenic processes and we're

354
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,490
gonna explore those basically what it

355
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,699
means is that there are areas of

356
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,730
convergence where the basic soil health

357
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,120
resources which is primarily carbon and

358
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,399
minerals alright are coming together in

359
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,590
some area but they're being lost in an

360
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,590
area of divergence okay

361
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:50,089
so when we think about historically

362
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,550
where are the areas where crop

363
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:57,050
domestication occurred and we have had

364
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:59,569
long and sustained food supplies okay so

365
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:01,909
and you would basically come up with

366
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,940
this list right we know that's from our

367
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:06,969
introductory agronomy courses and all

368
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:11,270
that these are the areas where we had

369
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,639
millennia of population growth and

370
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,360
increased food production how is that

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,929
possible

372
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,389
if we only have a limited bank of carbon

373
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,679
and minerals right so what do these

374
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,679
areas have in common

375
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:27,639
you might ask I did ask that well these

376
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,469
areas of what we might call hydro

377
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:33,049
biogeochemical convergence areas so I'm

378
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,590
really exploiting the Dictionary of the

379
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:40,250
Greek language here order by your life

380
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,460
and then geochemical right and so these

381
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,980
are areas in a larger geographic region

382
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,400
a catchment where these resources come

383
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,879
together through natural processes all

384
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,889
right water and whatever comes with

385
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,100
water what's dissolved in it either

386
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,559
coming from the surface or subsurface

387
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,389
ends up converging in streams these

388
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,039
streams converge into rivers these

389
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,410
rivers have flood plains and dealt us

390
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,559
that's where some of this material gets

391
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,990
deposited so the sediment the carbon the

392
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,419
minerals that comes with that are all

393
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,970
being concentrated in a relatively small

394
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,640
area and of course the health of the

395
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,519
soil in that area would then be much

396
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,460
more favorable than what the areas where

397
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,379
it's being lost okay so think about an

398
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,019
erosional process even under natural

399
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,210
conditions what's at the surface is the

400
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:34,099
best part of the soil and if that gets

401
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,430
lost and you concentrate it somewhere

402
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,909
else

403
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,940
that's very favorable

404
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,640
so when you look at you know

405
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,380
descriptions give carbon and nitrogen

406
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,000
profiles of these a grading soils that

407
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,880
are on the receiving end of this

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,740
they have very favorable properties of

409
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
course you know oftentimes they're also

410
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,589
physically very favorable because they

411
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,000
tend to be silty title material so one

412
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,949
example of that is of course it's the

413
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,549
lower now Nile Valley we know the

414
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,670
history of that millennia of cultures

415
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,639
and population growth but the catchment

416
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:13,029
of the Nile really goes from the

417
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,710
Mediterranean all the way down to East

418
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:18,160
Central Africa and the White Nile and

419
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,559
Northeast Blue Nile and so basically the

420
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,540
resources that come from that gigantic

421
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,789
catchment end up really all

422
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,399
concentrating in the Lower Nile Valley

423
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,190
you get the water you get the carbon you

424
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,170
get the minerals and you have that in an

425
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,110
area that's otherwise an extreme desert

426
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:38,410
right so you have this localized and we

427
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:40,599
know from history from even from

428
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,400
scriptures and all that you know what

429
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:46,209
went on there in that lower Nile Valley

430
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:51,160
so millennia of sustained populations

431
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,240
okay so a gradient soils continuous

432
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,019
mineral and organic matter additions

433
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,160
food surpluses that developed of course

434
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:03,789
you know once you kind of figured out

435
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,560
how to use certain plans to make crops

436
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,170
out of them they use em or wheat and all

437
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,929
that that allowed you then for trade

438
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:15,340
specialization administrative heart

439
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:18,640
hierarchies armies art you name it and

440
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:21,639
of course slavery right agriculture as a

441
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,500
very ugly history but slavery but you

442
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,110
know you think about if you bring in

443
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,940
slaves from other areas right you also

444
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:30,399
need to be able to feed them so you need

445
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,480
to have a pretty good food surplus to be

446
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
able to say we're bringing other people

447
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,610
in we're gonna make them do the work so

448
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,730
that we don't have to do it okay and and

449
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:42,429
we and we feed them okay not really a

450
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,920
great part of our history but it is all

451
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:48,380
was facilitated by the fact that you had

452
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,570
the sustained ability to create food

453
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,070
what we stand in the fact that there

454
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:55,429
were famines there were past problems

455
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:58,789
things like that in part related to

456
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,700
climate flood fluctuations another

457
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:05,839
interesting example is the value of

458
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:09,340
Mexico so in central Mexico there is a

459
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,959
basin and there used to be a lake there

460
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:14,359
that is in a volcanic region now

461
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,730
volcanic areas have naturally very

462
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,669
fertile soil your may thick rock

463
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,309
material and this is a geological Basin

464
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,160
so it doesn't drain to the to the ocean

465
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:28,519
and so you have a convergence there of

466
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:33,259
mineral resources that in this case came

467
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:34,970
to a very large lake and so this with

468
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,579
that you don't have the development of

469
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,360
these organic soils so the minerals fed

470
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:43,939
the crop the the production of Marsh

471
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,729
plants which then build up and so again

472
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,539
you have a huge bank account of minerals

473
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:55,000
that are developed over the millennia

474
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:57,289
now this area is no longer a lake and

475
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,200
it's one of the largest cities in the

476
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:03,339
world it's Mexico City right and it has

477
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,370
been drained now but naturally in the

478
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:09,500
earlier years this was the center of not

479
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:13,250
only crop production but of a very high

480
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,250
civilization right this is an impression

481
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,160
of what the city of Tenochtitlan would

482
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,349
have looked like right in the lake

483
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,560
pyramids and all that and basically the

484
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:27,349
population was fed from the marshes from

485
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,809
this area which we refer to as the

486
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:31,730
chinampas so if you have marshland and

487
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,700
you want to put it in production so you

488
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,529
have this wonderful rich soil full of

489
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,930
organic matter and minerals the only

490
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:42,019
problem is you can't grow so many of the

491
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,180
crops because you have water logging so

492
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,150
what do you do you dig canals and you

493
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,860
take the soil out of one area you keep

494
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,990
it up in another area and now you

495
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:53,779
mineralized that organic matter because

496
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,880
you oxidize it now and you have the most

497
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,329
productive soil you could ever imagine

498
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,930
okay and so but because these were

499
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:04,960
marshy area services tremendous Bank

500
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:07,299
of carbon energy and mineral resources

501
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,519
that that went with that okay and that's

502
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:11,259
you know sort of got some of the early

503
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,379
crop domestication going here

504
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,579
maize being wash you know that story at

505
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,100
several large cities not only

506
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:20,859
Tenochtitlan but also Teotihuacan which

507
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:22,240
you can now visit still it's a beautiful

508
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,729
site if you haven't been there with the

509
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,250
pyramids there tenochitlan is now

510
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:32,769
downtown Mexico City is like one little

511
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:37,569
ruin left of that and as an aside of

512
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:40,950
course the additions population there

513
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:44,439
the musci cos which a part of the Aztecs

514
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,330
were no-till farmers right they they

515
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,779
didn't have any draught animals or

516
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:51,399
anything like that and so they they use

517
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,920
planting sticks and they didn't really

518
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,800
do any toilets so they were way ahead of

519
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,509
our time of course when the conquerors

520
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,460
came they said to the indigenous

521
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:03,250
population you're doing it all wrong you

522
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,180
had to till the soil right and then they

523
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,670
say well we don't have any draught

524
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,810
animals well guess what you know this is

525
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,560
a beautiful mural

526
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,419
by Diego Rivera at the palacio nacional

527
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,759
definitely a place to visit because it

528
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,990
shows again this story

529
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:22,599
the human factor around agriculture and

530
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:25,599
and you know how that interrelates with

531
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,909
the natural resources so there are a

532
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,829
number of other biogeochemical

533
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,840
convergent zones that I think are

534
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:34,269
notable so one is Mesopotamia of course

535
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,909
where the source of the water and the

536
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:41,170
biogeochemical material is primarily

537
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:43,360
from the indo-gangetic plain right next

538
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,570
to the orographic the most active region

539
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:49,359
in the world to Himalayas constant

540
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:54,730
supply of fresh minerals and carbon

541
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:57,250
coming out of the mountains into and

542
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,099
then the North China Plain and the

543
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:03,390
Yangtze River Delta very similarly

544
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:06,189
so North China Plain is the Yellow River

545
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,520
estuary and so these areas were

546
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,670
continuously flooded the new supply of

547
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,609
minerals and carbon that came from upper

548
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:19,210
areas of the catchments and so these

549
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:23,349
became highly populated because there

550
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:26,200
was the opportunity for for high food

551
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:30,129
production another interesting example

552
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,289
is the country of Japan so Japan is a

553
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,330
very mountainous country you're mostly

554
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:37,420
volcanic you know I have quakes all the

555
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:40,029
time they just had one two weeks ago and

556
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,000
then you have relatively limited areas

557
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,589
here where you have these biogeochemical

558
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,970
convergence areas these are flood plains

559
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:51,490
or coastal plains and but most of the

560
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,548
country is is very mountainous and so

561
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,019
you can't really grow any crops there

562
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:58,750
except there may be some tiny little

563
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,389
valleys but so so most of the the land

564
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,450
or that is that can that can produce

565
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,070
crops is very intensively used okay they

566
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,590
don't really have a lot of space they

567
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:12,399
don't have a corn belt or anything like

568
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:15,250
that okay and so but again these are

569
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,320
biogeochemical convergent zones and they

570
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,950
allow for a very intensive crop

571
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:23,740
production and coming back home we have

572
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,870
that here in New York our best soils

573
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,359
here in New York are in places like the

574
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:30,219
Genesee Valley or to Schoharie Valley or

575
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,069
so these are air these are floodplain

576
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,700
soils they derive the resources from the

577
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:38,259
entire so some of our best soils are in

578
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,929
the Genesee Valley they can compete with

579
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:46,390
any soil in Iowa or any other place Ile

580
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:52,360
Genesee Hamlin these are the soils that

581
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:54,750
are are the best in the and what is

582
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,789
happening to these ancient

583
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,169
biogeochemical conversion zones well you

584
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,808
know we look at the cities that I'm

585
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,780
listing here that are now in these

586
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:08,428
highly priced agricultural areas right

587
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:11,950
so they've become very densely populated

588
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,780
they have the rivers have been

589
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,360
channelized so there's no more natural

590
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,069
flooding because it's terrible flooding

591
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,558
is terrible for the humans but it's good

592
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:23,109
for it was good for the soil to us one

593
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,339
Dam was built here so the whole idea of

594
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:27,099
what happened to the lower Nile Valley

595
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:29,409
that's oh no right Russians built that

596
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:31,779
in the 1960s but still

597
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,029
very intensive crop production now based

598
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:36,460
on synthetic inputs and some of the

599
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:39,099
worst soil health degradation you might

600
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:43,420
imagine you see now in these areas that

601
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:45,429
were naturally highly productive so that

602
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,550
brings me to so we talked about job

603
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,910
biogeochemical convergence but us humans

604
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:55,569
also have a big impact on that so we

605
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,480
might call it anthropogenic biochemical

606
00:26:55,569 --> 00:27:00,759
concentration but one very interesting

607
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,640
example of that is if you go to north

608
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:08,319
western europe not too far from where I

609
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:11,410
grew up and you see these Heath areas

610
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,970
with Heath vegetation right so it's

611
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,940
interesting because he is a pioneer

612
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,549
species so this area

613
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,160
what's glaciated and so about ten

614
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,750
thousand years ago we had enough there's

615
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,180
an opportunity for the invasion of

616
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,029
various species so Heath is one of the

617
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,430
first ones but these soils in in most of

618
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:34,829
these areas are very poor very sandy

619
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:38,920
maybe more rain out washed whatever and

620
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:41,169
so a lot of them are pot soils very low

621
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,480
blow inherent fertility but there are

622
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,300
these areas in the landscape typically

623
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,839
around some kind of a settlement maybe a

624
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:52,690
sheep Arn or farmhouse where you have

625
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,959
these fantastic soils or a deep organic

626
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,420
matter and so that's maybe initially

627
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,640
somewhat puzzling but we call these

628
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,550
source hog and soils or in Germany plug

629
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,370
and ash soils so a plugin is really kind

630
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:08,289
of like a like a cutting Assad right

631
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:11,409
that's what that word means so what's

632
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:12,549
happening there is that so first of all

633
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,080
it's somewhat surprising that you still

634
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,419
have heath vegetation when it's a

635
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,929
pioneer species it would have been taken

636
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,269
over by trees right but what the farmers

637
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,720
did in that area they concentrated the

638
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:28,059
resources from a large area around there

639
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,220
for their own farmstead okay what what

640
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:33,369
did they do so you had this the heath

641
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,230
they would cut the sod maybe let's say

642
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:36,819
10 centimeters it's a full of dense

643
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,690
roots and a little bit of soil material

644
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:42,099
they would bring that to the

645
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,990
furnish that in fact they you said as

646
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:48,609
bedding in the sheep barns then they had

647
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,920
a lot of sheep and the Sheep of course

648
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:53,229
would be grazing all over the place

649
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,990
in the landscape and they would be

650
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,839
eating the vegetation that's sheep

651
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,759
actually eat heath okay and then of

652
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,740
course at night you have to protect the

653
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,799
sheep from the wolf's and the foxes and

654
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,920
all that you bring him into the holding

655
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:12,220
pen the sheep aren't and they had the

656
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,830
heath sod the plugin as the bedding

657
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,420
material the sheep are there what did

658
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:18,159
they do at night well one of the things

659
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,990
that they do is they defecate and they

660
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,570
urinate so now you've got this nice

661
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,450
mixture kind of a sort of composted

662
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:28,539
material you mix it with some of the ash

663
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,370
and maybe char and then you deposit that

664
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:32,710
onto the soils around the farmstead so

665
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:34,809
now you had a very productive area

666
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,779
around the farmstead there was basically

667
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,730
the mining of resources from a much

668
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:43,660
larger area so it's kind of the same

669
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:46,569
idea this Jew biogeochemical convergence

670
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:51,370
into a smaller area so it's just human

671
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:53,129
ingenuity to create the system and we

672
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:55,359
know that there's other examples of that

673
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,730
many of you are familiar with the Terra

674
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,639
Preta to India soils because Johanna's

675
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,589
layman and his and it's lab team not a

676
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,910
lot of work on that it's a very

677
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:06,549
interesting paper that just came out

678
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,640
it's actually it's - not 2019 officially

679
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:14,139
it's just only that compares these soils

680
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:16,930
and so in Terra Preta in Brazil it's

681
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,480
more the chart it seems to be providing

682
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:22,090
some stabilization with the plug in

683
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,740
soils it's more the fact that they are

684
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:25,599
in a more temperate climate and so the

685
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,529
organic matter decomposition this is

686
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:32,259
lower but you know throughout you know

687
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:34,389
history there are these examples because

688
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:37,029
the Terra Preta soils are also basically

689
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,740
an example where people took resources

690
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,660
from a larger area and forests in this

691
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,410
particular case and then they brought

692
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:48,120
them into a smaller area where they were

693
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,120
able to concentrate those resources

694
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,970
so I'm talking about biogeochemical

695
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,190
convergence and gain areas but of course

696
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,279
they're also also lost areas right so

697
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:03,299
these are the areas in the catchment

698
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:05,849
that do not benefit from having carbon

699
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,859
and minerals coming from other areas so

700
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:12,389
these are the areas that are subject to

701
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:15,419
erosion and leaching of these minerals

702
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,850
and so these are much more fragile areas

703
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,800
and we've known now know that it's very

704
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:22,469
difficult to sustain crop production

705
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,809
unless he start out with an fabulously

706
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:31,230
natural naturally fertile soil like

707
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:34,619
Kamala soils and in the Midwest so it's

708
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:38,549
another pattern that has occurred over

709
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:42,419
the past years past millennium centuries

710
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:46,379
in early agriculture we had a strong

711
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:49,470
integration of crops primary producers

712
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,850
animals the primary consumers and humans

713
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,559
right

714
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:56,429
they lived all in the same year

715
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,450
typically on the same farm we saw with

716
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:04,110
urbanization we saw a separation of the

717
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,620
crops and the animals from the humans

718
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:10,259
and so some of the minerals and the

719
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:13,049
carbon did not get fully recycled but

720
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:16,769
most of them did get cycled around on a

721
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:19,579
farm now with the commodification good

722
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:22,259
turn by the way Peter I like that of

723
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:25,349
Agriculture we've had a separation

724
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:28,230
increasing separation of the crops from

725
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:30,599
the animals from the humans right and

726
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,210
this from a biogeochemical perspective

727
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:36,689
creates some challenges because now we

728
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:40,110
have this concentrated livestock areas

729
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:42,870
in this country and we are in one right

730
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,250
now or right here okay central and

731
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:47,839
western New York are an epicenter for

732
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:50,190
dairy production and a lot of the

733
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,809
supplemental grains that come out of the

734
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,120
Midwest that are being fed to these

735
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:57,079
animals means that there's a surplus of

736
00:32:54,119 --> 00:33:00,579
carbon and minerals in these areas

737
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:03,250
similarly Idaho California

738
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:05,168
mara peninsula poultry Northwest

739
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,359
Arkansas and then Eastern Carolina and

740
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:11,049
Virginia for for hogs these are areas

741
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:13,750
where where does a lot more animals than

742
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:15,099
would not normally be fed by the

743
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,679
surrounding areas

744
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:22,658
so basically what we have is a flow of

745
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,090
minerals and carbon from the central

746
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:27,840
crop production area in the country to

747
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:30,668
these primary livestock producing areas

748
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,699
including upstate New York okay

749
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:36,610
through these crops so when you think of

750
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,490
corn and soybean think of biogeochemical

751
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:42,158
material think of soil health because

752
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,319
these sort of materials that are fed to

753
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,929
the animals and then come out the other

754
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:51,759
end and are being used to improve the

755
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:54,700
quality of the soil so of course we know

756
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,200
from our agronomy history in sort of

757
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,690
science history that we've had some

758
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,429
technological developments over the past

759
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:05,470
couple hundred years on liebe Klaus

760
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,210
Haber and Bosch and the industrial

761
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:12,220
capacity after World War Two where we

762
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:15,398
now basically use synthetic minerals to

763
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:17,500
kind of resupply the losses that come

764
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:19,690
from the soil okay if we hadn't done

765
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,309
this we would have really run out of

766
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:26,940
minerals okay so basically what that's

767
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:29,949
what this map shows so we're now the

768
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,139
major loss of minerals and carbon is

769
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:34,809
from the central crop production area

770
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:37,720
we're shipping phosphorus fertilizer

771
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:40,148
from Florida Carolinas Tennessee Idaho

772
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:43,329
places like that and a lot of the

773
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:45,309
potassium comes from Saskatchewan and a

774
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:48,898
lot of the nitrogen because its

775
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:51,338
associated with natural gas comes from

776
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:54,638
the Gulf area

777
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:57,849
okay so we're resupplying the lost

778
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,030
minerals by using artificial fertilizer

779
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:03,760
but what we are not be supplying is the

780
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,099
carbon so there's no biological

781
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,250
component to this we're just we're just

782
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:13,260
resupplying the the inorganic materials

783
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,710
Selenia end up with a situation like

784
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,560
this so these are just two soil health

785
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:22,619
test reports that bob diddlebock gave me

786
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:25,529
one from a midwest grain farm and one

787
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,019
from a a northeast dairy farm and so

788
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,420
here the physical indicators biological

789
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:31,949
indicators and chemical indicators let's

790
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,130
ignore the chemical because it's all

791
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:37,319
basically fertilizer and lime but you

792
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,450
can see that you know the physical and

793
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,910
biological indicators of the Midwestern

794
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:45,419
farm score pretty low I mean it's a lot

795
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:47,519
of red and and yellow okay and you see

796
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,680
that the Northeast dairy farm is mostly

797
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,190
dark green which means that it's very

798
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,779
good so for these soil health indicators

799
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,730
we're getting very good numbers and

800
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,980
that's of course because there's a lot

801
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,530
of manure in the system and there's not

802
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,619
here what's interesting is the one

803
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:07,590
that's red is phosphorus on the dairy

804
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,210
farm because we down score when this

805
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,360
phosphorus that levels are excessive

806
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:17,280
okay so we have a problem with excess

807
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:20,150
here with the phosphorus how many of you

808
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,150
have seen this map

809
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,079
okay this map should be taught in every

810
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:26,639
introductory agronomy sustainable

811
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,750
agriculture course in the world

812
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:33,539
this map shows you the flows of grain

813
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,969
and oilseed crops around the world right

814
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:38,190
so when you see an arrow here I want you

815
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:40,619
to imagine that it's a flow of soil

816
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,780
health it's it's a flow of the basic

817
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,690
resources of mineral and carbon that

818
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,430
goes from one place to another right so

819
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:53,039
where's the where's most of that coming

820
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:56,779
from the Americas right US Canada Brazil

821
00:36:53,039 --> 00:37:00,719
Argentina right where most of it going

822
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:03,330
China Japan maybe something to Korea etc

823
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:07,319
look at the blue arrows which is

824
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:10,710
soybeans right so if you follow the news

825
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,300
you know that all the trade wars the

826
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,070
Chinese are saying well maybe you want

827
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,090
we don't want to buy your soybeans

828
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:19,890
anymore so they're probably going to

829
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:22,890
source it from resilience right so we

830
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:25,980
export 2/3 of our soybeans and half of

831
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:28,289
that goes to China so every third row

832
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,420
soybeans that you might see in a field

833
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:33,869
in Iowa it's gonna go down the

834
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,940
Mississippi River and to Iowa so but

835
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:38,880
think of that as exporting soil health

836
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,800
as well think of it as as the basic

837
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,460
resources that maintains the health of

838
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,720
the soil are being exported no Japan

839
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,570
here we actually export a lot of corn to

840
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,569
Japan and that is in support of their

841
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,370
dairy industry this is pictured from

842
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,670
Hokkaido sanam where are you you're

843
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:01,799
gonna probably see this I visited entire

844
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,019
kinoshita my former student there this

845
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,490
summer and you look at these dairy farms

846
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,289
and you know there's three barns there's

847
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:09,299
probably 120 dollars or something like

848
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:11,009
that and then you look at the amount of

849
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,440
land that stares like wow how can they

850
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,270
possibly feed this many cows from this

851
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,070
little land well a lot of it gets

852
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:20,420
imported from the United States so we're

853
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:22,890
building soil health in Japan okay and

854
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,050
so Hokkaido is here this is where that

855
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:27,420
picture was taken and keep in mind again

856
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,300
depend very mountainous country and so

857
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,579
these areas that are these naturally

858
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,960
productive areas it's all orbit this is

859
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,420
this is Tokyo

860
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,900
Oklahoma this is Nagoya this is Osaka

861
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,670
it's all organized the Japanese rely

862
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,460
very heavily on the few remaining

863
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,769
agricultural lands and one way they can

864
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,750
kind of facilitate is that by importing

865
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:52,949
a lot of those grains and thereby

866
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:56,429
importing schools and Japan it's not the

867
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:59,250
only one here's Korea my former home

868
00:38:56,429 --> 00:39:01,858
country the Netherlands also import a

869
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,179
lot of lot of grain and so in some of

870
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:05,750
these countries it's actually a big

871
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:08,940
problem they have problems with

872
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:13,739
eutrophication in yes to Ares in their

873
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:17,429
freshwater resources etc now similarly a

874
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:20,879
typical organic farm here in upstate New

875
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:22,919
York is also a biogeochemical convergent

876
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,769
zone because they very heavily rely on

877
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,409
compost the compost is derived from

878
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:31,409
whatever leaf clippings or whatever from

879
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:33,989
the from the surrounding region and so

880
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:37,769
you're basically accumulating that onto

881
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:39,358
a relatively small area okay and some of

882
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:40,980
these organic firms are actually

883
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,369
starting to have some problems with high

884
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,469
phosphorus levels well here's an

885
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:48,420
interesting example of biogeochemical

886
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:51,118
convergence and it's right here on

887
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:55,200
campus so this is the plant science

888
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,019
building is a man library so Nina basic

889
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:00,239
in the Horticulture Department every

890
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:03,119
year with her class he does kind of a

891
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:06,419
renovation project right and so some of

892
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,390
the landscaping is just fantastic it's

893
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,750
beautiful but the soil here on campus is

894
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:15,838
not naturally that fertile and so what

895
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,809
what Nina does is she calls it scoop and

896
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,099
dump you come in you put a lot of

897
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:22,559
compost on the thrilled and you kind of

898
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,588
mix it in with in with a small excavator

899
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:28,108
and and then you know you have this

900
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:29,639
wonderful soil comes out of it so what's

901
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:33,299
the source of the compost that's being

902
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:35,639
applied the dining halls here at Cornell

903
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,369
other sources well but list that so the

904
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,118
the food residues so where does that

905
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,300
food come from

906
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,720
well maybe California Idaho Florida

907
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,350
Texas whatever alright so think about

908
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,469
that

909
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:52,440
that when you look at these little plans

910
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:54,719
there in front of man library part of

911
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,000
that came from California or Idaho Texas

912
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,699
or place okay we're we're kind of

913
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,340
bringing together these basic resources

914
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,689
of minerals and carbon and putting them

915
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,789
in a place where we would like them to

916
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,010
be right nothing wrong with that

917
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:13,039
it's just kind of interesting to ponder

918
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:17,070
that right so we're now talking about

919
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,779
peak phosphorus right so the idea of

920
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,550
peak phosphorus like peak oil it's like

921
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,040
we're gonna be running out of phosphorus

922
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,830
fertilizer now the phosphorus mines in

923
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:29,369
Florida and Idaho are starting to run

924
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:31,500
out okay oh this is a problem right

925
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:34,409
well is it really a problem are we

926
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,900
losing a lot of phosphorus a lot is just

927
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:38,879
a reallocation problem right so we've

928
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,099
now we're accumulating phosphorus on

929
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,769
farms like here in Central New York or

930
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,079
in Eastern Carolina places like that

931
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:48,059
right and we're exporting them from

932
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,789
places like Iowa and Illinois

933
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:53,759
all right so the peak phosphorus problem

934
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,710
is partially the structure of

935
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,270
agriculture right that's kind of what

936
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,679
creates this problem it's not that we're

937
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:00,480
running out of phosphorus it's just that

938
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,690
we're putting it in places where it's

939
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,869
not great use to us while at the same

940
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:09,090
time having problems like here algae

941
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,969
growth in a Wasco lake which is just

942
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:15,030
north of here because we have excess

943
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:16,469
phosphorus right so one of the things

944
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,350
that I think we need to think about is

945
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:22,230
like in a way in New York we are on the

946
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,299
receiving end of a lot of great mineral

947
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,070
resources and carbon and all that it's

948
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,010
just we just pack it all into these

949
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,510
livestock based farms most areas where

950
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,600
it's a problem we need to spread that

951
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:37,140
around the woman okay I just want to

952
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,349
show you a few data results I mean we've

953
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:42,989
done a lot of research and published a

954
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,369
lot I just wanted to show you to give

955
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:46,799
you a little bit of an upbeat sort of

956
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:48,989
into this this is a study from North

957
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,830
Carolina where we collaborated with them

958
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:54,750
they did the cache test on a study that

959
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,529
involves different tillage practices

960
00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:01,159
from very intense

961
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:03,680
minimum till and what this shows you

962
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,690
here this is protein and yield they had

963
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,329
16 years of yield data it was a great

964
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:12,050
data set and it shows you two things one

965
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:14,779
is that as you reduce tillage you

966
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,280
increase the protein levels kind of

967
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,150
makes sense because protein is a very

968
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,800
labile form of carbon and nitrogen so if

969
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,490
you till this will get very easily

970
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,140
decomposed and so if you don't feel this

971
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,059
early kind of build it up but you also

972
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:33,108
see that has a very good relationship

973
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:37,429
with yield right so that's great so you

974
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:39,559
did that's good news you know so these

975
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:42,190
are the other indicators that has

976
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,949
significant correlations with yield and

977
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:49,070
I ranked them protein was highest

978
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:50,960
organic matter what's the most so you

979
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,970
look at these R squared values this is

980
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,490
from menial by the way and you see the

981
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:58,489
protein active carbon manganese

982
00:43:54,489 --> 00:44:01,250
respiration had the highest correlations

983
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:04,219
with yield organic matter was only eight

984
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:05,719
so total organic matter does not have as

985
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:08,500
good of a correlation with yield as

986
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,608
these labile sources of organic matter

987
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,260
manganese by the way is involved with

988
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:14,838
organic matter decomposition through a

989
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,740
redox reaction okay so these are all

990
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:21,019
associated with biological processes and

991
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:23,059
labile sources of organic matter Agra

992
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:24,949
stability is a physical indicator what

993
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:27,769
we know is strongly related in

994
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:33,439
biological so we're starting to learn a

995
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:36,440
lot about soil health and and and and

996
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,510
what are important attributes of soil

997
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,269
health I'm going to skip this because

998
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:46,010
we're running out of time one of the

999
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:48,679
show this is a Roley slide we're

1000
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:51,500
starting some work with with Dan Buckley

1001
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:53,059
so they are experts on microbial

1002
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,829
community analysis and Roley I think

1003
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:56,179
you've analyzed about five hundred seven

1004
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:58,159
hundred samples or something like that

1005
00:44:56,179 --> 00:45:00,199
they're coming to our lab and we take a

1006
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,848
little bit and we divert it to the Dan

1007
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,239
Buckley's lab and roly's been working on

1008
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:06,950
that this is a very exciting new area

1009
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,500
according to Dan you can do these

1010
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:11,000
analyses for less than $20 and I think

1011
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,570
this is going to be

1012
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,760
important part of the future okay

1013
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:19,760
conclusions natural forces spatially

1014
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,630
impact soil health right so lower Nile

1015
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,750
Valley indo-gangetic plain but

1016
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,930
anthropogenic forces are increasingly

1017
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:34,579
affecting the flow of carbon which is

1018
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:37,579
energy and nutrients okay and it becomes

1019
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:40,460
it's it's almost becoming the dominant

1020
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:41,989
process okay we have localized

1021
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,809
concentrations maybe with a small

1022
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:46,279
organic farm or dairy farm and then we

1023
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:50,119
have these regional national and even

1024
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:55,990
global flows of the basic resources

1025
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:58,549
around soil health and so the concept of

1026
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:01,250
regenerative agriculture or regenerative

1027
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:04,490
soil health management basically needs

1028
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:06,769
to recognize that situation so knowing

1029
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:08,419
that okay what are some of the

1030
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:12,550
opportunities what are some of the

1031
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:15,650
challenges so one of them is to use good

1032
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,670
agronomic practices like reduced tillage

1033
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:21,110
better rotations cover crops

1034
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:25,159
geographically reintegrating livestock

1035
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:28,789
and cross and also to think more deeply

1036
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:31,250
about harvesting these nutrients in the

1037
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,440
organic matter the idea that we have

1038
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,989
such a problem with excess nutrients and

1039
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,360
carbon on these dairy farms here and

1040
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:41,000
that we have other parts of the state

1041
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,289
where the soils are starving for carbon

1042
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,239
and nutrients okay

1043
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:46,369
is there something can we be a little

1044
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,500
bit more creative about that so maybe

1045
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:50,539
that means processing some of that

1046
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,150
manure maybe you know yo.hannes is very

1047
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:55,579
interested in pi realizing or maybe Tora

1048
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:58,039
faction which is drying maybe other ways

1049
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:00,259
to process that manure and make it

1050
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:03,469
logistically feasible to spread these

1051
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,910
resources around a little bit so I kind

1052
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:08,089
of wanted to stimulate that kind of

1053
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:11,750
thinking because I think in New York we

1054
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:13,430
have that opportunity to to solve some

1055
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,000
of these problems but first you need to

1056
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,859
understand

1057
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,670
source of that problem right which is

1058
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,559
very structural very economically driven

1059
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:50,579
okay with that I already went a little

1060
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:52,349
bit over time so thanks very much so the

1061
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:55,679
question is you know whether anaerobic

1062
00:47:52,349 --> 00:48:00,150
digestion impacts or all these these

1063
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:02,159
processes so and I'm not an expert in

1064
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,800
that area but basically what you're

1065
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,049
trying to do there is is capture some of

1066
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,250
the energy as methane which you could

1067
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,250
also capture in other ways

1068
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:16,710
pyrolysis you could capture it through

1069
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:20,639
direct questions as many ways ways to do

1070
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,740
that um I I think that you know it

1071
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,369
doesn't necessarily solve this problem

1072
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:32,009
it is just this it it is a processing of

1073
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:34,170
the manure that still retains the excess

1074
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:36,000
nutrients you reduce the carbon a little

1075
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:39,119
bit but it doesn't necessarily in a

1076
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,219
structural way unless you take the

1077
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,650
resident residual material and you put

1078
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:47,309
it you take it off the dairy farm or off

1079
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:50,220
twice so in terms of this bigger picture

1080
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:51,840
problem it's not necessarily a solution

1081
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,939
that's why I'm saying we need to maybe

1082
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,710
think about see a big part of the

1083
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,960
problem with manure is the bulkiness

1084
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:59,940
right it's difficult to transfer

1085
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,210
transport another issue is sort of

1086
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:06,750
pathogens so if we can kind of address

1087
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:08,190
some of these constraints and we can

1088
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,980
find ways to spread it around for

1089
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:13,200
example dry manure would be much easier

1090
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,809
to transport over somewhat longer

1091
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:19,439
distances so even if you can get the

1092
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:22,259
manure ten miles out on the arm right it

1093
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,150
would do a tremendous amount of benefit

1094
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:28,010
most in terms of reducing the problem on

1095
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:31,460
the livestock farm and helping the land

1096
00:49:28,010 --> 00:50:29,960
off the livestock

1097
00:49:31,460 --> 00:50:31,849
you know well I mean in a way these are

1098
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,490
very gross generalizations right I mean

1099
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:36,529
there there are lots of livestock farms

1100
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:39,649
in the Midwest there's a lot of hog

1101
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:44,210
firms also egg farms consider so it is

1102
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:46,369
it is a gross generalization so the you

1103
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:48,320
know here in the in the Northeast when

1104
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:50,420
we use perennials especially perennial

1105
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,990
legumes or maybe even color you know

1106
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,400
cover crops are a relatively small

1107
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:57,559
solution to this bigger problem but

1108
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,800
they're they're potentially useful so

1109
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:04,190
yes I mean it but but the the legumes

1110
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,160
primarily relate to nitrogen and so it

1111
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:09,349
doesn't necessarily relate to the other

1112
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,909
but your point is well-taken in that you

1113
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:14,000
know we can grow some of that carbon

1114
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:16,399
here right so and they can grow some of

1115
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,639
that carbon in places like Iowa by using

1116
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:22,940
better rotations bringing in cover crops

1117
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:24,799
and all that so you can use those basic

1118
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,590
minerals resource even if they're

1119
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,670
synthetic and you can still build up

1120
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:34,039
their soils if you use better rotations

1121
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:36,380
and better cropping systems right and so

1122
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:41,170
that's what that's one part of that

1123
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:41,170
solution right yes

1124
00:51:41,739 --> 00:52:37,000
I would agree with that we mean the

1125
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:39,760
effects of slavery that happened in the

1126
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,690
past and the current structure

1127
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:48,730
agriculture that is maybe not labeled a

1128
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:52,030
slavery but it's still very unequal yeah

1129
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,769
yeah so it's it's no and III agree I and

1130
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,810
that's why I bring it up I think I think

1131
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:58,420
we need to have it's something that we

1132
00:52:55,809 --> 00:53:00,880
tend to sort of sweep under the rug a

1133
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,970
little bit but agriculture is the

1134
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,510
primary has been the primary economic

1135
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:11,519
activity associated with slavery or or

1136
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:14,109
sort of unequal treatment and I think

1137
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,690
it's good for us to sort of talk about

1138
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:20,349
what serves we're sort of some of the

1139
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:22,750
underlying driving factors associated

1140
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:27,009
with people had slaves basically

1141
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:30,639
linguistic in the ancient world and they

1142
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:33,310
again this is a sequence you you have

1143
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,769
ample food production you know think

1144
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:37,449
about an expeditionary force you know

1145
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:40,079
like you can read about it in the

1146
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:43,179
storica document in the scriptures where

1147
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,829
armies would go out and they would

1148
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,690
capture other people well first of all

1149
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:49,299
you need to be able to sustain an army

1150
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:52,389
which is a logistical challenge even

1151
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,039
today and and then you need to bring

1152
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:54,949
those people back and you need to feed

1153
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,789
them

1154
00:53:54,949 --> 00:54:02,289
and enslave them and and so it was a

1155
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:04,519
very sort of devious sort of set of

1156
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:08,210
actions that sort of created that

1157
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:10,369
situation and you know many millennia

1158
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:12,798
later we actually transported people

1159
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:15,200
across the ocean for the same purpose

1160
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:18,289
and now we you might argue that there's

1161
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:21,368
some issues around the labor that we use

1162
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:24,170
in agriculture this these days right and

1163
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:25,818
that has also to do with the structure

1164
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:29,150
of agriculture that everything has to be

1165
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:31,039
cheap and so this we can talk about that

1166
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,170
for I'm not an expert in that area but I

1167
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:37,338
think it is important that we have have

1168
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:50,869
you know that we are honest about that's

1169
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:53,869
part of what we do this has been a

1170
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:58,119
production of Cornell University on the

1171
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:58,119
web at Cornell edu
