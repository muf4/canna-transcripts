1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,480
university

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,559
this part is

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
some conclusions to the research it's

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,198
mostly

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,000
my experiment going out when i think

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,760
about not trying to put some way to

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,119
communicate with the

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,439
brother

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,640
by a biology community and find some

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,839
help

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,200
or some collaborative

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
future interaction for the for research

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
i do

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
and

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,239
this particular presentation

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,239
i have to start from the end

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
don't get excited i recently for another

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,280
this is not my airport really this is an

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,560
effort of many people

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,840
that are spread all over six continents

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,159
and speaking 20 or more languages and

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,960
they are really the ones that

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
made this impossible

25
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,640
by

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
putting up my questions and my annoying

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,719
being pretty much annoying and trying to

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,719
force them to help me

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,438
and also this is the network of

30
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,679
everybody in the room in form of it

31
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,839
just tax payer as long as you pay taxes

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
if not then you're not contributing to

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,118
this paper you

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
his research

35
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,759
and i have to also pay

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
my respect to the 19th century

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,640
capitalism

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,479
and the smell of foundation that started

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
my research in this area

40
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,560
so

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
since i started from the end i'm going

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
to give you a title

43
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
and

44
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,118
when we look at the background like this

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,920
when we go to the

46
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,758
field everybody sees something different

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,719
some people see volcanoes some people

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,759
see snow thinking about skiing and when

49
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,800
i go there i see plants mostly big trees

50
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,399
and

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
even more i see

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
the specific

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
part of the plant

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
the conducting tissue

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,080
and when i look at it i always ask the

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,159
question what makes plants a plant what

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,760
makes the plant to be a single organism

58
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,120
that has its

59
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,919
hundreds or sometimes thousands of

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,719
distal organs placed on the branches and

61
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,119
millions of rootlets in the soil and how

62
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,039
they function all together as a huge how

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,439
do they imagine without having a neural

64
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,840
network without having a brain so from

65
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,000
our animal perspective we think

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
everybody should have some translated

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,239
signals of environment to make it

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,360
respond to the environment

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
in a coordinated manner and here we have

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
the plant that doesn't

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,439
have that

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
kind of

73
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:11,280
ability to anticipate or

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,119
perceive the environmental cues

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,719
ship them to one place

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,719
digest them make this information

77
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,959
decision

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
and then spread them back to say okay we

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,080
need to do this or that in this

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
particular region of the plant

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,120
and

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
when i think about it what makes khan

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,719
depart the most

84
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,518
amazing part of this is that

85
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,280
whatever we go to field right now

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,280
especially around the

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,439
corner you go to the forest and you see

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,840
not plaques you just see

89
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,039
the

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,598
tubes that conduct water

91
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,759
covered by bark and tubes that look like

92
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,598
sugar under the bark

93
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,878
during the summer right now they're not

94
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,639
doing much but they're just standing

95
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,039
there you see basically big conductive

96
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,518
tissue you see the huge microfluidic

97
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,519
device

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
and to give you the

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,319
kind of a

100
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,919
feeling

101
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,958
what is this scale of this micro fluidic

102
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,878
device

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
you can look at these numbers four

104
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,000
million kilometers

105
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,160
of tubes are in the single

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
eucalyptus tree which is ten times

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
distance

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,840
and thirty trees put all the tubes from

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,199
the tree we reach the sun is eight

110
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,159
minutes of life travel it is a huge

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,319
amount of microfluidic system way more

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
than humans have in form of their

113
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,478
vessels

114
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,639
or even nervous system and this

115
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,279
xylem tissue is also

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,680
matched by the little bit shorter but by

117
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,039
flying transported transport shooters

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
from the

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,439
think it is it means that those

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
transport tissue they have to somehow

121
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,800
in my opinion at least interact and

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,720
pre-create this system

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
response this is this is this part what

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
we call right now this is new word

125
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,198
emergent properties this system of the

126
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
tree has these emerging properties those

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
transporters that has emergent

128
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,560
properties of coordination

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,520
among those distilled parts of that

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
so

131
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,599
the observations i have

132
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,120
kind of over the last 10 years of

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
working with drugs

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
that all

135
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,839
almost all biological responses that

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,919
i've studied have always byproduct in

137
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,399
forms of the hydraulic

138
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
properties adjustment or changes in

139
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,439
hydraulic properties whether it's needs

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,720
roots

141
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,879
xylem tissue or fluid there's always

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
no matter what kind of

143
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,360
element we study whether it's nitrate

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,519
sugar transport whatever category is

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,840
always a component of hydraulics

146
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,959
and i try to convey the message that

147
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,279
this hydraulic component may be the past

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,758
dynamic

149
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,559
part of the

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
microphone risk of this macro leading

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
system

152
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,359
that

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,400
can allow for well increasing increased

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
well-being

155
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,638
basically can make the pump

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,199
function in more

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,759
efficient way

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,800
so the puzzle that we have

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
is we have those whole levels the

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
difficulty of studying this kind of

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,918
question of this kind of a

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,840
paradigm

163
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,839
is that we have to study

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,038
some kind of a stick to shower but

165
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
anyway we have this

166
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,318
part of

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,560
a different scale from molecular scale

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,600
subcellular same

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,439
scale to true to medium space of several

170
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
centimeters when we have tissues

171
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,000
interact to hold let's say in my case i

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,318
like to sew the whole tree and how we

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
can combine all those elements together

174
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
is a big question

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,680
challenge technical challenge

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,879
so first i will try to explain or not

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
say just

178
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,038
put you in a through the

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,478
way how i thought about it why can't

180
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,918
they come up with this idea that they

181
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,478
have to this microbiology system has to

182
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,359
be a part of the

183
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,240
informational system in trip by the by

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,879
looking at three different unique

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,879
parts of

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,399
through three different unique

187
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,719
responses of plot to particular

188
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,959
environmental triggers and how they

189
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,360
translate to water

190
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,439
adjustment hydraulics of fats and how

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
they can eventually meet

192
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,279
the

193
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,719
this premise of emerging properties that

194
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,959
they call plants

195
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
so i will go through three examples root

196
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,519
nitrate update sugar transport and

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,079
concentration of co2

198
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,560
and this is the first it's about root

199
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,878
update and nitrate update virus one of

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,639
the observations that i made recently

201
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
was that

202
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,360
when we apply nitrate to previously a

203
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,360
little bit starved nitric starch plants

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
of course nitrate presence will trigger

205
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,000
dietary transporters nitrogen be taken

206
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,519
out by root but at the same time we

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,120
noticed that plant increased extremely i

208
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,439
mean extremely but within very few

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
seconds within 30 seconds changes its

210
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,959
hydraulic properties of roots by

211
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
allowing more water to go through the

212
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,038
membranes of parenchyma cells and

213
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,439
and this

214
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,000
this two slides show

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,320
tomato and cucumber

216
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,639
and the

217
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
a and b chose tomato become the response

218
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,918
to nitrate addition to the solid

219
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,799
solution and then the blue line

220
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:47,439
shall increase versus control green line

221
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,719
show the increase of flux through the

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
root

223
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,399
completely

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
unrelated

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,639
to any changes of

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,639
driving force this was not caused by

227
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,319
changes driving force highly pressured

228
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,120
braking or small degrading across the

229
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,360
road it will just change by the cellular

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,839
adjustment of cell

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
cell properties which is the lower graph

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
shows the

233
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,359
test of the

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
half-time water flow through cell

235
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
membrane in the parenthema cells

236
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,640
and

237
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,199
bars show that

238
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,958
application of nitrates to roots

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,240
will require required costly drop in the

240
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,559
resistance of membrane watercolor

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
so here we have this nitrate application

242
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,958
resulting in the

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
chant in the

244
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,079
properties of hydraulic properties of

245
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,958
fire

246
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
and so

247
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,759
what causes at the molecular level this

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
change we are getting was of course

249
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,240
aquaphoring but

250
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,680
we were trying to find out what how this

251
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,240
signal of nitric translate is what

252
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,519
what creates the change

253
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,159
in micro

254
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,839
between membrane components what part of

255
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,439
this nitrate transfer cut creates a

256
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,760
change and this is

257
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
we use the tongue state time state

258
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,799
applications to decide whether we're

259
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,559
trying to block the

260
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:19,278
nitrate assimilation but with time state

261
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,119
hoping that maybe some by-product of

262
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,320
nitrate from hydrogen as the innovation

263
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,278
but will

264
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
let us

265
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,200
decide which part of the pathway is

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
responsible for adjusting water

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
component of the

268
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,199
quadratic cloud

269
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:38,078
and we successfully stopped the response

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,959
of nitrate

271
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,359
on cucumber but not on tomato

272
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,838
with time state when we checked in both

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,879
cases the

274
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,760
nitrate until nitrate

275
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,159
the

276
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,278
nitrogen simulation part was blocked in

277
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,600
both cases but in case of the

278
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,639
cucumber we also noticed that we blocked

279
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
the

280
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,519
uptake nitrate transporters into the

281
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,679
application of time state so they gave

282
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,639
us a very nice simple experiment to see

283
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,639
which part of the pathway is responsible

284
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,958
for the

285
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,720
for changes in aquaporin activity

286
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,319
because tungsten

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,879
in tomato the other one

288
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,879
shows the

289
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,519
nitrate in tomato

290
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,240
taxi tomato blocked the nitrous

291
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
dissemination part but did not do

292
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,879
anything to

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
to

294
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:38,399
blocking the reporting activities when

295
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,399
we change when it when in cucumber

296
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,559
and cucumber

297
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,720
we chime we block nitrate transporters

298
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,759
at the same time we

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
block the active activity of aquaponics

300
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,679
at the same time so they they did not

301
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,760
not block that they did not respond to

302
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,120
the presence of lightning so it was

303
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,039
obvious that nitrate inside this cell is

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,879
responsible for increasing the

305
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,000
conductance of the

306
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,320
membrane so we injected nitrate glue

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,839
back all of the cells and we

308
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
get back

309
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
we activate the cochlear implant and

310
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,078
increase the water flow

311
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,159
to the cell so in this case i did kind

312
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,759
of a short inside of the cell but

313
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,159
at that point i

314
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,639
as i am a whole plant biologist i

315
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,278
kind of let this go to the

316
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,360
people in my lab to try to study what

317
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,200
molecular level responses are involved

318
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,519
in this type of

319
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,759
response when i went to

320
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,600
bigger picture try to understand why

321
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,278
factory father changed nitrate activity

322
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
with

323
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,600
by adjusting the watercolor

324
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,600
and this is an overview of the

325
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,240
concept that we had is that

326
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,600
in when there is no nitrate present

327
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,759
basically takes up water and nitrate as

328
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,000
they are available in the soil however

329
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,000
when

330
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,278
when suddenly one place

331
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
nitrate which is a mobile nutrient if

332
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,078
the soil shows up due to the rain event

333
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,000
or some activity of microbes around one

334
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,078
part of the root system

335
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
each plant would like to take it out but

336
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,838
as it triggers out the nitric

337
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,000
transporters up regulates nitrogen

338
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,920
transporters might be clean the nitrate

339
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,679
presence in the surface of the root so

340
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,838
it would be beneficial for grams to

341
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,159
bring more nitrate lower the root by

342
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,040
increasing the flux rate of water

343
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,240
so if it can change the flux rate over

344
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,759
the root

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,600
then it would be

346
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,838
automatically increasing availability of

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
nitrous it's a feed forward effort and

348
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
when over time

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
plant nitrate is

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
it is mobile nutrient we shift from one

351
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,120
spot to another

352
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,119
plant can turn off water resistance i

353
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
mean turn out the

354
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,799
uptake of water in one part of the root

355
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,879
system move it to another part when the

356
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,958
nitrate is present and again

357
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,039
benefit from having the

358
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,039
flow range toward the root

359
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,879
and this was the concept so

360
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,039
we then tested it

361
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,399
on hydroponics and we built a new system

362
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,879
with two roofs

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,198
split root system two balances and then

364
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,480
we provide one

365
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,879
part of the

366
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
root with the

367
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,439
with the

368
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,719
nitrate

369
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
and

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,879
you can see on those crops that there

371
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,480
was immediately met by increased water

372
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,600
dropping from this part of the roof and

373
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,959
the other part dropped down the optical

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
because they need the plant is

375
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,518
collecting water from where the hydrate

376
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,320
is and when we rotated the roots they

377
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
immediately switched back and nitrate

378
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
became the

379
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
plant with nitrate the roots with

380
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,919
nitrate presence was able to take up

381
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,240
more water with migraine when the other

382
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,078
one was shut down which gives us the

383
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,639
feeling that this is an interesting

384
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,359
example of

385
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,000
seemingly unrelated processes nitrate

386
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,159
updating and water up when one is really

387
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,799
increasing the potential

388
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,278
of the other turning on the water from

389
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,879
nitrate gave us and gave the pump a

390
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,120
chance to take up

391
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,120
to benefit from taking up more nitrates

392
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
when the nitrogen is available but also

393
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
it gives us

394
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
this static

395
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,519
distribution of roots in the soil

396
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,759
with mobile nutrients that can shift

397
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,679
from time to time from place to place or

398
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,120
can be triggered by microbial activity

399
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,679
in different places you can temperature

400
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
degrees of water available

401
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,479
this can

402
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,958
allow plants

403
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,959
despite being immobile to chase

404
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,000
nutrients

405
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,399
by adaptation of physiological activity

406
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,480
turn on here rules and the calculations

407
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
in the other one so this is one of the

408
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,239
examples of how plant can adjust

409
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,039
hydraulics

410
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,039
to

411
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,879
seemingly non-related

412
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,120
physiological activity

413
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,039
so we can put together two pieces of

414
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,639
puzzle two different levels from

415
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,879
molecular several levels to hollywood or

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
part of the root system level

417
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,799
the other example

418
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,519
that comes from my study is the

419
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,758
interaction between sugar

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,919
transport and

421
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,000
anxiety transport

422
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,159
this is a very simplified view what

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,120
happens but

424
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,519
when sugar is transported

425
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,240
there is expectation that there are some

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,560
ions being recycled over time to

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
maintain the sugar flow from the shoot

428
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,119
to the root

429
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
and

430
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
interestingly when this happens those

431
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,639
ions goes from

432
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,639
fluorine

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,919
it goes from chlorine to xylem tubes

434
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:52,078
and flow up back to the

435
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:55,360
cells at the top of the plant and this

436
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:58,679
is interesting because destroying

437
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,680
this flower

438
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,240
the presence of ions in this island can

439
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,399
change

440
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,318
the resistance of the xylem itself so

441
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
those the tubes that are in the flow in

442
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,838
the xylem they

443
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,759
conduct water

444
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,198
and for a long time they were assumed

445
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,759
that they are

446
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,160
permanent pictures that they like act

447
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,759
like pipes but they like 10 years ago

448
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,798
you find out that they're not acting

449
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,798
like

450
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,119
mere pipes they they are

451
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:35,038
also dynamic you can adapt their

452
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,038
resistance to waterflow

453
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,840
they can adapt resistance to presence of

454
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
ions in this item that can come from the

455
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,918
zeitgeist interaction and these are the

456
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,959
graphs that shows increasing flow rate

457
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
of

458
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,759
in the xylem different concentration of

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,679
potassium in the in the sub

460
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,000
and

461
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,840
percent of related flow fluorine

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,319
due to the individually desired tubes

463
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,399
and this was later on we showed that

464
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,399
this is really

465
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,360
related to

466
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,600
border pit membrane properties

467
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,000
these are border physically with our

468
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,759
links between two adjacent

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
vessels in the plant

470
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,759
one of them here

471
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,759
one of those

472
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,360
one of the border pits here is open and

473
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,719
you can see through so this water goes

474
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,319
to one side

475
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
to the other side of the vessel to

476
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,480
another

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
vessel element

478
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
to those border pits that are composed

479
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,038
of

480
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,558
the hybrid materials composed of many

481
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:57,119
fibers gels and

482
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,000
potentially some parts

483
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,519
and when we look closer closer at the

484
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
scores

485
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,839
they are

486
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
this is a recent afm analysis of the

487
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,639
border path itself

488
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,199
when

489
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,160
just two fasting images shows two

490
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,319
different moments two different

491
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
uh

492
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,599
properties of borderline memories the

493
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,439
one on the left

494
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:27,199
shows the membrane is produced

495
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,759
this is the space

496
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,759
i think this is

497
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,879
this is the this is the

498
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,119
elevation image of the

499
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,280
afm atomic force microscope when we

500
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,719
probe the surface of it and you can see

501
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,519
that this is

502
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,279
this is kind of a flat surface very

503
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,839
difficult to

504
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,759
to distinguish anything underneath this

505
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,918
fiber structure of the order fit

506
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,400
membrane is hidden under the general

507
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,038
kind of material and when we expose it

508
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,679
to 50 micro molar concentration of

509
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,480
basically this gel in those border fits

510
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,120
it collapses making it much more

511
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,079
strict and much harder surface and much

512
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,839
more features on it we have potential to

513
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,240
see the

514
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,079
the

515
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,440
fibers these are black

516
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,839
lines here they

517
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,080
and

518
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:25,038
also you can see you can see kind of

519
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,918
long quick clarification you said 50

520
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,158
micro mole over this means i mean

521
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
sorry in this case it's 50 millimolar

522
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,520
yeah

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,519
because we wanted to get it very strong

524
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,319
usually in plants it goes from

525
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,879
a few from from 2 millimolar to 7

526
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:44,319
millimolar here is we wanted to see the

527
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,480
big change and we did see it and if this

528
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,558
change collapse the gel

529
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
to make the surface much stiffer but at

530
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,038
the same time much more permeable to

531
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,038
water

532
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,960
and again this is the microscope

533
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,679
those images were showing this

534
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,679
is this interaction of ions being

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,679
recycled from flow and

536
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,000
at the might end and then microscale

537
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,000
level

538
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,120
change at the

539
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,520
structure of border with membranes and

540
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,519
when we look at the whole plant level

541
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,200
we can try to understand why can't

542
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,879
bother to change this micro

543
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,558
micro

544
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,400
through the properties of this micro

545
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,200
fluidic systems

546
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,440
for is there is there any physiological

547
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,000
meaning for it or biologically for a

548
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,159
well-being of the whole map to do it we

549
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,200
did a long time ago with peter meltzer

550
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,159
here we did this study of

551
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,880
when we took the plant

552
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,280
this was a tobacco and we took parts of

553
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,159
this island attached them to

554
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,399
tubes and then we flow in one case the

555
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,600
eye water in our way the i was randomly

556
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,759
substituted the eye water with

557
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,839
artificial stuff composed of true

558
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,599
whatever we can read in the book how

559
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,038
with artificial stuff and then the

560
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,678
moment we substituted with the

561
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,960
artificial stuff the part with the

562
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,240
substitution

563
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,720
was

564
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,120
increased dramatically the flux rate of

565
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,240
water from the particular part of the

566
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,158
pump allowing to say that

567
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,759
composition of salt

568
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,679
can really change the rate of

569
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,558
utilization of water through this

570
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,519
particular heart anxiety when we go back

571
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,480
to the

572
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,400
water

573
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,319
the resistance increased and the water

574
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,640
update decreased from this particular

575
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,639
zone

576
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,480
so this is a really complicated system i

577
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,119
this was everything so far was done

578
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
and

579
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,399
outside the plant or in case of

580
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,440
with artificial sub here i wanted to

581
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,559
decide is it true that by dealing with

582
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,480
or

583
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:57,440
changing the property of transport

584
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,919
employment i can induce changes in xylem

585
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,000
rate of water delivery to come

586
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,080
so this is a

587
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,200
setup where plant

588
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,439
was tortured in extreme ways

589
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
by the fact that it was pressurized in

590
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,840
the roots it was on the balance then we

591
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,640
changed the light condition humidity the

592
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,918
top

593
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,720
to

594
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,240
and to affect the flux

595
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,919
and then it was also

596
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,679
the flight was gurgled to change the

597
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,960
way that time

598
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,159
uh

599
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,240
to to induce the flop to to force plants

600
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,240
to stop transporting the time and

601
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,038
eventually we are able to measure

602
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,640
between two transducers t1 and 2 we are

603
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,640
able to measure resistance of this

604
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,679
island and

605
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
also

606
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,840
determine from

607
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,879
the rate of water flow in the plant

608
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:52,879
which allow us to find out that indeed

609
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,200
with moment when flying was disturbed

610
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,840
the resistance of xylem increased

611
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,798
dramatically so it is

612
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,519
completely related one to the other that

613
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,839
as long as plant can recycle ions can

614
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,839
maintain

615
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,278
it can maintain

616
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,278
preferable xylem flux conditions if it

617
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
cannot transport ions

618
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,159
i mean the recycled ions through the

619
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,679
decline

620
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,600
from glyphosate

621
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,640
the resistance of plants

622
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,158
to water flow dramatically increases

623
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,240
and how does this

624
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,600
play the role in the whole plant

625
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,440
environment interaction that's that's an

626
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,480
example that i can think about but i

627
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,919
would like to

628
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
later on

629
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,640
to study in details but in shape

630
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
conditions with all those

631
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,120
aspects of low photosynthetic activity

632
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,240
low export rate low ion circulation

633
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:54,558
this results in high resistance to water

634
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,839
flow so those parts and plants that are

635
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,000
in shape they may not get water

636
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,879
in opposite situations when one of the

637
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,599
parts

638
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,400
one part of the body is exposed to sound

639
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,519
just entire activity of transport and

640
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,679
recycling alliance increases the

641
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:16,000
capability or

642
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,519
capacity of xylem for water transport

643
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,599
and

644
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,839
can enhance water delivery to most

645
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,319
productive plant parts

646
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,199
so this is again a system where those

647
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,558
minuscule changes or unrelated seemingly

648
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
unrelated

649
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,839
part of plant biology like blind

650
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,558
transport and recycling of ions can

651
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,759
force or can make

652
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,960
induce

653
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,440
the

654
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
increased productivity

655
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
plants in

656
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,840
areas when plants really needs this

657
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,759
particular

658
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,319
situation and you can envision that over

659
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,759
time when sun is going in the forest

660
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,519
different parts of the

661
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,440
tree crown will be exposed to sun at a

662
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,240
different time and only those that are

663
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,960
getting most light will be most

664
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,798
supplied with water and ions from the

665
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,038
from the side

666
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,839
third so this is another part is you can

667
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:11,038
put together again a cellular level or

668
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,240
sub-cellular leather information

669
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,158
with

670
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,319
tissue level adjustments and improved

671
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,960
performance

672
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,558
next example is coming from leaps

673
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,480
this is something that i am studying

674
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,119
currently so i don't have a nice

675
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,278
description of it however when leaves

676
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,278
are

677
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,798
i mean they compose you know they

678
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,719
compose

679
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,519
a lot of cells but mesopostals and

680
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,038
conducting tissue cells and when we look

681
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,720
at them

682
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,640
the interesting aspect that we're

683
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,159
finding out right now is that presence

684
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,038
of co2 inside cells changes the

685
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,880
aquaporin activity

686
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,960
in the cells too this is again a

687
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,039
by-product of our foreign activities

688
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,440
that allow or stop

689
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,839
water being delivered to and injure

690
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,240
ourselves or changes resistance of water

691
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,839
being delivered from zion to epidermal

692
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,519
cells or plants

693
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,199
and interest

694
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,359
the interesting part is that the more

695
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,558
co2 there is in the leaf

696
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,639
the more resistant is the pathway

697
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,879
between xylem and

698
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,520
stomata and the more resistance is this

699
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,000
pathway it means that stomata has harder

700
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,119
time to get water so if there is any

701
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,599
loss of water they will shut past them

702
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,439
and how this will play in the whole

703
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:34,000
well-being of belief it might be that

704
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,000
when

705
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,640
it might be the leaves that are in the

706
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,319
shade i.e they are not productive they

707
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,480
have increased level of co2 because

708
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,519
there is no much photosynthesis in the

709
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,919
juice so if those leaves can reduce

710
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,079
the loss of water

711
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,000
then they will automatically

712
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,639
preserve this water for most productive

713
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,640
beams that need water and they can cause

714
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
a lot of water so if they reduce

715
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,159
the water loss

716
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,798
due to the department they have higher

717
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,360
concentration around them then they will

718
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,359
be able to

719
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,759
utilize this water in other parts of the

720
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,398
plant similar to adjustment of

721
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,398
resistance to design

722
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,240
so this is the third puzzle i mean not

723
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,480
two puzzles together again we have

724
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,319
cellular component

725
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
co2 uptake but at the same time it

726
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,639
translates insult to aquaporin

727
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,640
and affects the ability

728
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,320
and lost water

729
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
so in this case we have the

730
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
little elements

731
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,599
smaller research components

732
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,200
getting us to

733
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,359
another

734
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,120
steps emerging properties of the entire

735
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,240
system how those little parts can create

736
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,038
a plan

737
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,038
that is responsive to

738
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,558
environmental cues

739
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,480
and trigger some

740
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,480
higher level and organismal level

741
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,759
adjustments

742
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,278
so

743
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,119
this is the question i have how to

744
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,720
understand the vascular network if it's

745
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,038
composed of

746
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,640
millions of kilometers of

747
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,558
vessels and

748
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,200
millions of cells

749
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,038
that compose that provides

750
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,679
capacitors for water and there are those

751
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,519
resistances between cells and this is

752
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,200
just i should just

753
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,278
make it a

754
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,600
bigger picture but this is just a small

755
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,079
part of

756
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,119
the equation

757
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,639
and

758
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,678
to start it we we have this problem that

759
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,440
all those

760
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,559
this research has to be done on the

761
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,558
vessel the conduct water under tension

762
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,200
so any disturbance to it makes it

763
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,440
possible to just stop the transport or

764
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,519
they done in deployment which

765
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,840
is under positive pressure but then the

766
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,440
disturbance to it also stops the flow

767
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,558
this time proudly

768
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
and

769
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:02,240
interestingly

770
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,319
anything that i try to do is met by

771
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,319
this this fact that this is from

772
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,278
methodological challenges is

773
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,678
very well confirmed by all the reviewers

774
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:14,159
that i have to meet on my way

775
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
since and this is no additional chart

776
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,000
just send you letters that are longer

777
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,319
than your papers and why

778
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,079
something is wrong with the methods

779
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,519
but unfortunately they never say what i

780
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,000
should improve they haven't been

781
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,278
criticized but that's okay

782
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,519
so fighting with it i i have to

783
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,038
why this is difficult because scales of

784
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,879
a preservation we have to observe

785
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,398
something you get microscale

786
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,360
and

787
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,119
and somehow translated to tens of liters

788
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,199
of the tree

789
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,959
there's as i mentioned before

790
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,440
everything is in the plant every

791
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,440
transport is intra cellular there is

792
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,159
really no extra cellular

793
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,679
xylem vessels are cells

794
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,440
and flaxseed machines are not outside

795
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,278
black sevens inside the plant views

796
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,759
everything is small

797
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,398
and they under tension and

798
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,839
they under high pressure so what we can

799
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,479
do

800
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,359
i tried so this is a long term project

801
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,038
so it started many years ago

802
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,359
and i think that age stroke will

803
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,079
recognize this little device on the left

804
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,519
with probably that his first attempt to

805
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,119
measure or just

806
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,278
create the tension in the microbiome in

807
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,719
my biomedical device when we're trying

808
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,720
to measure load of

809
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,919
generate transpiration in

810
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,720
microfluidic device and measure tension

811
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,720
for the first time

812
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,880
this was

813
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,879
not silicon what was this pdms

814
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:48,240
and of course the moment we did this the

815
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
first thing we always get was embodies

816
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
at the time when we connected to the

817
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,679
tube there was an embrace and no more

818
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,679
just spitting function

819
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,398
but

820
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,398
so the next step i did with

821
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,519
was to develop an artificial leaf

822
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,158
where we were trying to

823
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,558
generate fluxes not through it really

824
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,880
but through the bubbler

825
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,879
and all those examples of what i tried

826
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
to do they end up in some kind of a more

827
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,159
or less

828
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,240
published material except that they did

829
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,159
not yet contribute to answering the

830
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,798
major questions

831
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,799
but i hope

832
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:31,278
but like this one this this paper

833
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:35,038
this this evaporative device allowed us

834
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:37,200
to create a better understanding of vein

835
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,319
vein spacing in the path

836
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,840
what drives the white hole in fact eight

837
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,839
millimeters of lane this

838
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
weight many millimeters of vents per

839
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,720
square millimeters of

840
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,960
beam tissue versus let's say

841
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
uh

842
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,440
that had one millimeter of anchor

843
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,760
millimeter of surface of it

844
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,159
this device allowed us to

845
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,440
design or better understand the scaling

846
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,440
of the nation if we use

847
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,759
the other part so this is this is kind

848
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,480
of an overview of method that i try to

849
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,319
develop to understand the

850
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,960
well-being of fun so this is by a

851
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,678
beginning of the device that we

852
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,798
bio that we try to understand the flying

853
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,000
cloud

854
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,918
in using the first micro

855
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,480
microfluidic device when we are able to

856
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,000
separate two

857
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,480
two micro channels with the

858
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,919
semi-permeable membrane and analyze the

859
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,919
rate of flow

860
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
versus the concentration of sugars and

861
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,038
size of the plant tubes

862
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,839
which gave us the ability to predict

863
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,960
why certain plants have the tubes that

864
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,079
are like try to cover this a 50 micron

865
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,038
diameter clam tube when the uk industry

866
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,398
has

867
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,359
constructed about 15 micrometer diameter

868
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,599
tube

869
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,359
or why

870
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:05,119
tomato has 25 megapixel 100

871
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,199
despite the different sizes different

872
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,719
distances that this artist transported

873
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,358
and this is a scanning law that we

874
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,158
developed when we can

875
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,398
predict the leap size

876
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,838
might be the loading

877
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:22,638
sample for

878
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,320
for for photosynthetics to employ

879
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,838
is related

880
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,159
to

881
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,320
i mean times one third of the

882
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,760
power of stem length gives us the

883
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,519
predicted rate radius of the of the

884
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,480
planet which is kind of an interesting

885
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,679
finding

886
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
that

887
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,480
can

888
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,039
be expanded across a lot of different

889
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,918
sizes of plants from arabic galaxies to

890
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,918
become industry

891
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,800
also so this

892
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,119
these are the viability part now i try

893
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,200
to develop methods that will allow me to

894
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,440
look inside the plant and this is one of

895
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,439
the methods that i call the remote

896
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
access methods this is remote access

897
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,320
deployment mode where i loaded the dye

898
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,680
into the leaves and

899
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,400
then

900
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:11,679
i'm able to follow up due to the

901
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,280
bleaching of diet the rate of movement

902
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,838
of dying time

903
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,800
allowing me to

904
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:22,000
determine the

905
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,200
rate of flow and hopefully also to

906
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,320
decide

907
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,719
later on right now but later on to

908
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,720
create

909
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,879
to expose those plants to environmental

910
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,879
triggers to see how loyal flow rate

911
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,559
directly affects other particular

912
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,559
hydraulic properties of the plant

913
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,358
this

914
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,880
is

915
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,679
this is another part

916
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,039
i try to loop into the leaps

917
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,319
when i

918
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,279
try to

919
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,200
measure the rate of flow of water into

920
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,640
the knee

921
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,799
to have

922
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,639
to to determine

923
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,920
if i trigger a particular part like if i

924
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,960
change the

925
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,119
availability of co2 in it how is water

926
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,440
flowing in particular parts of the new

927
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,599
change so this is a movie that shows

928
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,039
that i came right now entering the

929
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,599
distribution of water across the river

930
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,519
again i am missing this little part yet

931
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,200
how to

932
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,199
get to

933
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,199
exchange

934
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,160
this is another card so this is bleeps

935
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,720
this is stem this is a

936
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:38,000
work that we did on trying to look

937
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:40,799
inside the stem of the ground using mri

938
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,440
and this movie shows it's kind of

939
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,119
very short you can see this black

940
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,358
little

941
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,800
kind of

942
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,598
sorry

943
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,039
this little black

944
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,119
speck going

945
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,279
through the um right now

946
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,920
this is an anabolic formation in the

947
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,280
plant so this plant was under stress

948
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,119
this plant

949
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,160
was in mri and

950
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,720
at one point we got disturbance from my

951
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,480
from us to the plant

952
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,959
there was a

953
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,519
particular event that showed that there

954
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,240
was employees later on this up here

955
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,880
this so mri proved to be very

956
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,799
hard to look into the

957
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,760
well-being and water distribution in the

958
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,680
stand which gave us an immediate look at

959
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,000
what happens to water in this case the

960
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,679
blue is not water but blue is air what

961
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,719
happens to air inside the plant during

962
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,639
the embolus events how is it distributed

963
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,879
in three-dimensional scale all the time

964
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,199
and how it disappears which proves first

965
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,400
of all that embodies can be revealed but

966
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,960
also shows us that we can look

967
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,760
at macroscale and microscale events that

968
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,000
happens in vietnam

969
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,079
so this is another now we're going below

970
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
ground this is another part of this

971
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,800
system this is

972
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,800
root access

973
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,800
where

974
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,519
when

975
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,680
we make the on-time observation of water

976
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,358
uptake by europe you can see that water

977
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,719
disappears from

978
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,799
root and shows

979
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,399
we can calculate how much water at what

980
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,920
time is being taken out by one

981
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,320
particular pump

982
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,960
and this is the two pictures here it's

983
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,720
after two hours the color brighter color

984
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,720
they were covered in red

985
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:32,078
more water was being taken up at that

986
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,399
particular time from particular zombies

987
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,320
and you can see that two are in the park

988
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,079
in this particular system we have to

989
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,119
shift the water update from the top to

990
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,800
the bottom and again i this technique is

991
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,599
developed

992
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,839
to hope to make it possible to put

993
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,838
together

994
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,119
some

995
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,838
additional

996
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,160
like other nitrates to this system and

997
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,799
see how this nitrate will influence what

998
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,519
they're having on the soil

999
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,440
the problem

1000
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,440
okay so there is another car so there's

1001
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,599
more more of those there's insider

1002
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,400
inside i call it because then we try to

1003
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,079
do

1004
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,639
looking inside the planet very

1005
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,880
microscopic very small levels to see

1006
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,480
droplets in vessels or

1007
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,880
how the heat look like inside during the

1008
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,639
active transportation these are the scm

1009
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
pictures

1010
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,039
so they not really show the active or

1011
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,879
real-life elements but at least they

1012
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,480
gave us the feeling

1013
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,640
how the environment looks like so when

1014
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,760
we try to model it later on we can get

1015
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,759
the true dimensions from the system and

1016
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,280
learn how they interact with the

1017
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
environment

1018
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,599
and direct access

1019
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,280
to plants this is a micro probe that we

1020
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,880
poke into design

1021
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,160
and the pressure graph here shows that

1022
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,680
i was poking going in the xylem probe

1023
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:58,799
pressure to the town and eventually i

1024
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,960
force it to

1025
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
to generate some tension

1026
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,679
and

1027
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,239
most likely

1028
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,399
embolize it a little bit because

1029
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
and then over time

1030
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,680
the pressure probe reached the higher

1031
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,679
and higher pressure of almost two bars

1032
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,239
and at the end

1033
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:21,118
i i was not in the room in that farm no

1034
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,598
one was in the room it suddenly hit

1035
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,358
what i call the repeating moment go down

1036
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,318
to negative pressures and embolize the

1037
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,480
game

1038
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,239
so this was this is an example of direct

1039
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,119
practice to silent and observation of

1040
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,118
embodies revealing

1041
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,280
and last the moment

1042
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,920
is the last kind of slide here this is

1043
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,040
i try to overlay all those physical

1044
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,440
measurements of system on

1045
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,159
whole transcriptome analysis

1046
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,200
check what genes are being triggered at

1047
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,719
particular physical events

1048
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,159
during the

1049
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,679
during the

1050
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,719
time

1051
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,838
i mean

1052
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,919
if we

1053
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,239
force particular spots like force and

1054
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,039
this is cycle about anybody's repair if

1055
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:10,639
we force plants to embody and then wait

1056
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:12,079
for repeating we can check what pathways

1057
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,920
and what

1058
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,119
particular processes are being

1059
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,880
upregulated due to this response

1060
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,160
so each of those

1061
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,160
techniques that i use

1062
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,880
require some kind of a miracle to happen

1063
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,240
each one is extremely complicated

1064
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,039
and i call every researcher miracle

1065
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,598
and when we have 10

1066
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,239
different aspects to measure

1067
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,160
simultaneously it's a huge miracle here

1068
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,078
we have to measure

1069
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:48,000
50 or 60 different elements

1070
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,920
simultaneously at a big macro scale and

1071
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,239
it's extremely

1072
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,240
interesting from the perspective of how

1073
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,118
to do it and i don't know how to do it

1074
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,039
yet this way going around us people

1075
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,680
and put together the picture how this

1076
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,119
plant is capable of responding to a lot

1077
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,679
of stimuli

1078
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,519
and how this local stimuli spread across

1079
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,358
the hydraulic system

1080
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,880
and how they interact with other kinds

1081
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,639
of stimulus and how they create this

1082
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,920
hybrid i call it the high drug

1083
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:20,318
informatics how they do this

1084
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:24,960
hydroinformatics will allow plants to

1085
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:27,599
interact with environment and create a

1086
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
created

1087
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,000
shape the tree

1088
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,239
that

1089
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,960
that is well adjusted

1090
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,838
to the environment and how those

1091
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,920
changes influence the fluxes inside the

1092
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:42,639
pump

1093
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,960
and

1094
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:45,759
make the blood work all together

1095
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,079
and

1096
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,400
so now sorry

1097
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,119
now i can go to the beginning which is

1098
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,440
from micromasters of microbics and say

1099
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,480
how this hydraulic integrated blockable

1100
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,039
autonomous responses

1101
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,039
are being

1102
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,960
are made plant vascular system to be the

1103
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,199
dynamic coordinator of everything that

1104
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,159
happens in the country very narrow very

1105
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:17,279
short areas

1106
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:20,759
and i i know i'm not too long hopefully

1107
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,760
45 minutes

1108
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,439
any questions

1109
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:48,358
um

1110
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:13,838
but it takes few years probably so i'm

1111
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,838
just looking rather for people

1112
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,399
or for themselves but

1113
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,358
just using some information that you can

1114
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,200
provide but i mean this is

1115
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,279
as i said this is a very difficult

1116
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,199
problem from the perspective of

1117
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,720
combining all those

1118
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,719
measurements into one big system

1119
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,799
and every time we try to measure

1120
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,799
something it's one miracle we have

1121
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
so modelling is going to be a big part

1122
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,039
of it

1123
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,960
and we use models to even model the

1124
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,559
biome by

1125
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,079
mimicking devices

1126
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,679
where we know everything about the

1127
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,160
system and we still

1128
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,159
have to model parts of it

1129
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,559
to understand what's happening here so

1130
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,799
indeed it's been more difficult but for

1131
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,960
the for example structure of the

1132
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,839
internal structure of leaves makes the

1133
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,838
boundary conditions

1134
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,119
i mean it is not easier it just makes it

1135
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,119
more difficult

1136
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,719
do you have a hypothesis about how co2

1137
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,719
effects at the

1138
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,679
uh foreign is as i said it is kind of we

1139
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,720
started to do it recently so we don't

1140
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,719
have the hypothesis however

1141
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,078
we i don't have

1142
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,279
a clear view

1143
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,839
how does

1144
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,400
events

1145
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,119
of

1146
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,119
the nitric oxide

1147
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,439
we would require probably

1148
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,519
one hospital for two graduate students

1149
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,440
to direct

1150
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,679
you know analysis of

1151
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,440
expression of some genes or activity of

1152
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,519
proteins and

1153
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,200
i don't i don't even imagine how to

1154
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,960
start thinking about these signaling

1155
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,719
molecules which ones are being

1156
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,838
responsible for it

1157
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,759
we can probably predict

1158
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,759
whether concentration of sugars are

1159
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,319
important or

1160
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,400
what what whether ph

1161
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,000
in the cell was due to co2 concentration

1162
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,079
might be important which is a

1163
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,280
possibility because ph was shown to

1164
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,839
affect

1165
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,680
so you increase co2 level chinese ph of

1166
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:35,358
water in the hypoplastic might include

1167
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,239
which part of it is

1168
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:42,598
responsible for the second lifetime

1169
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,598
so here you're going to also have

1170
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,318
there is a lot of things that co2 can

1171
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,759
just affect very general question the

1172
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,559
experiments that you do are almost seem

1173
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,760
to be

1174
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,759
directed toward trees

1175
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,759
yeah because

1176
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,839
but in any case

1177
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,920
do you

1178
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,759
do similar experiments on herbaceous

1179
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,318
times really small plants in these

1180
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,119
qualitative differences

1181
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:22,239
they i can i show trick because i like

1182
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:26,318
them but unfortunately most of my work

1183
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,318
was done on unfortunately

1184
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:33,358
on the herbaceousness i mean i do for

1185
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:36,000
semi-finals but we work with cucumber

1186
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,000
tomato

1187
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:39,318
tobacco

1188
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,039
soybean

1189
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:44,719
and popular

1190
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,599
and many other trees

1191
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,239
i

1192
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,280
have kind of a question rhythm

1193
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,439
not

1194
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,519
specific plant

1195
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,838
so if i have a question and i go

1196
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,599
downstairs to the greenhouse of the room

1197
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,279
and i find it on

1198
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,680
it's good for me i learned the name

1199
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,680
later

1200
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,839
so i really don't mind what i'm starting

1201
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,800
to put on again the confidence there

1202
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,119
and often we have i just don't i just

1203
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,119
gotta just take the first time and i can

1204
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,800
you know this was nice this one

1205
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,800
and then i asked the people what

1206
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,838
but i like since i work with arnold

1207
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,318
arborito

1208
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,318
i like free so i always show the tricks

1209
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,598
so it seems to me one of the problems

1210
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,960
with modeling is you latch on to some

1211
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,559
idea

1212
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,240
and then you model everything around

1213
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,599
that

1214
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,439
and you

1215
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,599
as a result you may have looked

1216
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
something else that might be more

1217
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,519
important

1218
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,680
but

1219
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:58,480
the instance is that struck me

1220
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:01,199
is when you have shade versus sea

1221
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,480
sun leaves leaves in the shade versus in

1222
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,318
the sun

1223
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,240
most of the water was going through the

1224
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,519
leaf in the sun

1225
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,759
you suggested that this was because the

1226
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,960
leaf was

1227
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,400
photosynthesizing altered the level of

1228
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,519
co2 the co2 all the water flow

1229
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,838
but

1230
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,880
the most important thing with regard to

1231
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:25,358
transpiration is going to be temperature

1232
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,200
and your shade leaf is not going to be

1233
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:30,239
at such a high temperature as the

1234
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,838
sunlight could you not explain this

1235
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,199
entire movement

1236
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,880
on the basis

1237
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,279
of temperature influence on

1238
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,358
transpiration rather than going and

1239
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,359
worrying about the small changes you're

1240
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,679
liking against co2

1241
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,400
i i'm not trying to explain the level of

1242
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,759
transpiration and trying to explain

1243
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,559
the resistance

1244
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
yes

1245
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,960
of course the sun temperature there will

1246
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,800
be more transpiration in this summary

1247
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,199
and if you have a constant resistance

1248
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,839
let's say one

1249
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:03,199
the drop of pressure

1250
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,358
with particular level of flow

1251
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,519
you'd have i don't know

1252
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,358
another one let's see one megapascal

1253
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:11,280
drop across the factory

1254
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,000
however if you can drop this resistance

1255
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,160
half then you for the same transpiration

1256
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,358
rate you're dropping pressure would be

1257
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,078
on the half

1258
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:22,318
so your you will be able for fun to be

1259
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,440
able to keep stomata open to sustain

1260
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:28,400
this transpiration without

1261
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,400
dropping the pressure

1262
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,960
so what i'm trying to say is not how

1263
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,358
does this influence the transpiration

1264
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,679
rate but how fun can we distribute

1265
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:41,199
limited resources between parts of

1266
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:43,440
plants to most productive ones so yes i

1267
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,879
wanted to be transparent as much but i

1268
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,559
wanted to do the

1269
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,960
low pressure drop so they don't need to

1270
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,119
jump shut stomata

1271
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,400
if you increase resistance the load is

1272
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,720
suddenly

1273
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,039
suddenly there will be not enough water

1274
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,118
capacity transport capacity president

1275
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,558
and stomata will shock transpiration

1276
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,079
will be the same

1277
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,000
but there will be no

1278
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,160
production because there is no co2 out

1279
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,159
there

1280
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,519
okay so it's not about how much water

1281
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,119
goes to particular parts but how one can

1282
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:15,920
manipulate and redistribute water

1283
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,920
between the parts

1284
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,719
right at the beginning you're talking

1285
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,838
we're talking about sort of thousands of

1286
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:27,919
buds and repeated parts of plants i was

1287
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:29,920
immediately highs

1288
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,079
and that you know sort of to some degree

1289
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
in sort of a hive organism

1290
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,599
all these different uh

1291
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:40,399
you know individually capable parts but

1292
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,000
somehow achieving coordination

1293
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,519
to what extent do you think that you

1294
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,199
know if you're modeling the resistances

1295
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:48,000
of your

1296
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,439
your examples tended to focus on sort of

1297
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,960
the

1298
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,519
proximal

1299
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,199
uh functional aspects of what was

1300
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,639
happening locally in the changes of

1301
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,799
existence but

1302
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,879
what extent do you see that as sort of a

1303
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,839
long-distance communication pattern sort

1304
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,920
of like the bee

1305
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:08,719
dance where the patterns of resistance

1306
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,559
and the resulting hydraulic properties

1307
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,519
patterns of water potential are actually

1308
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,240
sort of a

1309
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,480
communications network that allows the

1310
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:19,118
different parts of the plant to

1311
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,838
coordinate yes so as i said this is a

1312
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,960
dynamic project yes i do

1313
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,358
you know that there are a lot of

1314
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,119
capacitors on this

1315
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,400
schematic

1316
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,318
and of course

1317
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,559
if you if you have this

1318
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,960
system with some capacitor which sells

1319
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,160
certain capacitors the spread of

1320
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,639
hydraulic signal or changes in the

1321
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,639
in the distribution of the retention

1322
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,639
industry or changes in distribution of

1323
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,679
pressure in deployment

1324
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:47,920
will

1325
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,078
not be instantaneous across the plants

1326
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,400
they will happen in time and then

1327
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,280
depending on the disturbance level they

1328
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,680
can disappear at certain distance so yes

1329
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,680
the the degree of the

1330
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,838
response or the

1331
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,078
the way that thumb is constructed or the

1332
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:06,078
capacitors of the of the system they

1333
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,480
will influence the spread of

1334
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,760
hydraulic adjustment of the plant

1335
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,920
and

1336
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,760
in any way this is

1337
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,480
i think that this hydraulic can serve as

1338
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,359
a kind of a fast dynamic first level

1339
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,318
response it will be later matched by

1340
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,639
all kind of chemical responses

1341
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,960
that are required by

1342
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,960
physical delivery of something from one

1343
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,079
part of the plant to another and it is

1344
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,519
probably

1345
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,519
another level of

1346
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,400
response that i am not studying but it

1347
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,119
would be very interesting to see how it

1348
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,400
changes in distribution

1349
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,200
the fast response

1350
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,838
much later is much later on by

1351
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:50,399
phytohormone distribution and other

1352
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,759
signaling molecular distributions

1353
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,720
but i do think that it's not

1354
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,280
it's not on the short distance local

1355
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:02,000
chain but it's spreading if one part of

1356
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,960
the route changes the water potential

1357
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,280
inside the root this signal or

1358
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,199
i would call the signal but this

1359
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,119
the change in one part because it's

1360
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,318
interconnected will influence

1361
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:17,760
distribution of potentials or tension in

1362
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,759
the entire system to certainly

1363
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:25,480
other questions here

1364
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,480
are there questions in geneva

1365
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:28,558
um

1366
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,920
first of all i want to thank you for a

1367
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,440
really

1368
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,680
thought-provoking type of a seminar

1369
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,599
and really a seller all the way to the

1370
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,639
try to explain things for four player

1371
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,798
bases

1372
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:44,318
on the very first section that you had

1373
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:46,000
with the root uptake and the nitrite

1374
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,159
and maybe i just missed in the detail

1375
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,920
but what was the concentration where

1376
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,480
you're seeing these

1377
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,760
influx or the changes in the flux rate

1378
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,880
of the water

1379
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:01,200
so depending on the plant we we were

1380
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:04,480
trying to to use plants that are having

1381
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:07,358
less nitrate than in the cropland so

1382
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,280
basically between one and below one

1383
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,920
millimolar

1384
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,559
of nitrate in the field conditions

1385
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,798
and when we change it to about one

1386
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,760
millimolar they were already responding

1387
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:22,400
to it later on we used basically 0.5

1388
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,760
millimolar and 5 millimolar is kind of a

1389
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,440
fast

1390
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,319
frustrated change

1391
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,440
but

1392
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:31,199
we try to use the more

1393
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,318
natural environment concentration for

1394
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,318
nitrate than properly

1395
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,440
how rapid on the

1396
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,838
response to the internal

1397
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,400
economic resistance and the

1398
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:54,880
relief with the sun versus shade

1399
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,639
how quickly would that respond

1400
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,880
because if we have

1401
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,759
for example clouds go over

1402
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,000
or

1403
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,040
sun moves and these go in and out of

1404
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,719
shade

1405
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,960
uh how quickly

1406
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,639
did that response occur and was it

1407
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,159
equally reversible

1408
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,480
at the same rate

1409
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,480
you mean

1410
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,000
this

1411
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,400
i don't have right now the dynamics of

1412
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,838
it and how fast it happens right now we

1413
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,280
are at the level of

1414
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:22,719
enthusiastic

1415
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,519
wow that we can

1416
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,798
see of good affects and so basically we

1417
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,519
collect

1418
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,599
we do mostly

1419
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,960
the physical

1420
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,640
we can measure the response

1421
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,119
within

1422
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,920
several minutes right now

1423
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,640
maybe you can think faster but i cannot

1424
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,400
get higher time resolution

1425
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,440
so we see that there's evidence of

1426
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,559
between several minutes

1427
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,798
you can

1428
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,798
in aquaponics

1429
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,359
so how do you depart the effect of the

1430
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,000
nitrate

1431
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:07,598
on the root water uptake and then the

1432
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
effect of the nitrate on the hydrogels

1433
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,000
shrinking

1434
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
very easily uh what i did i cut the

1435
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,239
roots

1436
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,079
applied the nitrate at the same

1437
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,078
concentration and i found

1438
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,559
the effect of

1439
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,720
like 10 percent or less

1440
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,000
versus the flaxes that were manipulated

1441
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:36,318
by by nitrate undamaged roots that are

1442
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,559
40 or 60 percent which suggest that it

1443
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:39,759
was mostly

1444
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,680
resulted

1445
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,520
from the root and also the resistance of

1446
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,558
the radial resistance of the root in

1447
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:48,480
this particular case is about 50x higher

1448
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,599
than the resistance of internal diagrams

1449
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,280
so 10

1450
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,280
change in diameter

1451
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,519
translate to less than one tenth of a

1452
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,359
percent to 100

1453
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,599
of the total resistance

1454
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,400
of blood so it was meaningful comparing

1455
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,000
to what was doing in response to

1456
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,318
medication

1457
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,760
now i have a second question to that so

1458
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,159
what about the root cap or the

1459
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,480
rhizosphere zone where there's a gel

1460
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,679
there is that responding to ions and

1461
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,159
affecting

1462
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,759
water absorption at all or if you had a

1463
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,239
chance to

1464
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,240
throw like different salts on to the

1465
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,239
system

1466
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,960
everything was just behind me but not

1467
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,960
behind very close to super ice dawn

1468
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,679
like 80 to 90 percent of water was

1469
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,079
flowing close to the sugar ison when the

1470
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,078
tip of the growing part of the roof was

1471
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,640
responsible for less than five percent

1472
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,480
of water out there so even big changes

1473
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,118
in the

1474
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,119
properties

1475
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:04,318
it might change in the dry soils when

1476
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,318
the root growth

1477
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,960
well

1478
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:21,440
magic will be here through tomorrow if

1479
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,599
you uh would like to uh get a meeting

1480
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,480
with him that's probably possible to

1481
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:31,000
come up after uh right now um

1482
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,000
let's thanks watch again for us

1483
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:44,039
this has been a production of cornell

1484
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:44,039
university on the web at cornell.edu
