00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,320
University good afternoon everyone as

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,759
Jenny said my name is Megan Williams and

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,960
today I will be discussing our work on

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,359
investigating the nitrogen management

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,039
and alphalpha variety performance in a

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
dual use kza alphalpha in our cic system

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
so let's start out by breaking this

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,518
title down into its components to help

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
us better understand the why and the how

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,640
of this study starting with perennial

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
crops and their

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,799
benefits first some stats the

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
agricultural sector accounts for more

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,558
than onethird of all Global greenhouse

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,799
gas emissions with around 11% of those

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,399
emissions coming from synthetic nitri

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,439
fertilizers including its manufacturing

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,960
Transportation application and po post

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,799
application soil emissions which make

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,320
synthetic edine fertilizer account for

22
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,878
around 2% of global annual greenhouse

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,679
gas emissions synthetic nitrogen

24
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,000
fertilizers are the main source of

25
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,159
nitrogen in conventional Agriculture and

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,959
wheat is one of its top users as one of

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,080
the top three crops in the world

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,199
covering around one and a half% of the

29
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,959
earth land area perennial grains have

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,200
been identified as a potential

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,199
sustainable alternative to annual grains

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,118
like meat due to their wide ranging

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,840
benefits which include soil health

34
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,159
benefits from increased below ground

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,280
biomass inputs improved water

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,759
infiltration and access carbon

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,478
sequestration and lower overall carbon

38
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,159
emissions with their year-to-year

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,239
longevity allowing for reduced tillage

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,680
and for few tractor passes for

41
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,078
planting here we can see a side by-side

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,079
comparison of the root profiles of

43
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,559
annual wheat here on the right and the

44
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,438
perennial grain crop known as

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,600
intermediate wheat grass here on the

46
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,478
left these deep roots are what are

47
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,478
largely responsible for the improvements

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,200
to soil

49
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,879
Health next let's dive deeper into

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
intermediate weat grass as a perennial

51
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,239
grain crop also known as perza just a

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,640
disclaim kza is technically just the uh

53
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,359
trade name for a specific cultivar of

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,598
The Grandin product of intermediate

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,478
wheat grass but because cenza is a lot

56
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,878
easier to say than intermediate we grass

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,640
and because we did use that specific

58
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,719
cultivar in our work I'll should be

59
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,839
saying cenza for the rest of the

60
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,239
presentation so while initially

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,280
cultivated in the US as a forage crop

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,599
intermediate weak grass was selected for

63
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,080
development as a perennial grain species

64
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,439
over other peral grasses towards traits

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,000
that include High grain yield and size

66
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,000
as well as grain qualities like

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,878
nutrition and taste the intermediate

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,800
weak grass cultivar known as Minnesota

69
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,518
Clear Water became the first perennial

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,319
grain commercially available under the

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,920
trade name kza kza grain has been used

72
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,158
to make a wide range of products

73
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,199
including beer flour pasta cereal and

74
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,519
more and I personally can endorse the

75
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,598
fact it's very tasty um however despite

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
Kenza being selected for development as

77
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,959
a pral grain there are still reasons why

78
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,759
Kenza is not yet a household name

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,000
despite successful breeding efforts to

80
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,959
increase its grain size current of grain

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,919
is still about onethird the size of

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,840
commercial annual wheat has been

83
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,079
estimated that it'll take another 24

84
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,439
breeding Cycles to get KS of grain size

85
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,519
up to par with wheat additionally Kerns

86
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,000
of graani Neals consistently do decline

87
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,200
over time in this graph from latell at

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,959
all we see two different populations of

89
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,878
intermediate weed grass both

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
significantly declining in Grain yield

91
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,359
from year one to year two this grain

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,599
yield decline makes Farmers less likely

93
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
to want to maintain a Cen stand for

94
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:37,199
multiple years thus negating some of the

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,040
perennial benefits so beyond breeding

96
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,759
for grain yield maintenance over time

97
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,679
research is being carried out to

98
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,518
understand how agronomic management

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,360
practices can affect current of grain

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,280
yields over time while still maintaining

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,079
the sustainability benefits of its

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,318
perality findings in the 2018 paper by

103
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,680
Tois at all suggest that intercropping

104
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,598
cenza with the legum forage crop does

105
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,480
have the potential to better maintain

106
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,359
currenza grain yields over time time

107
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,280
when compared to fertilized monoculture

108
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,280
alone so next we're going to talk about

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
how intercropping sits in our

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,239
sustainable perennial

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,560
framework intercropping is the practice

112
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,798
of having two or more species of crops

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,680
in one field at the same time Studies

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,358
have shown that intercropping has a host

115
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,000
of benefits compared to Conventional

116
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,758
monoculture including yield increases

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
which can lead to a higher land use

118
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,360
efficiency where the same yields can be

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
produced on less land as well as higher

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
yield stability over time we can see

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
these Trends here in this figure from

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
Lee at all where they intercrop maze

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,560
with other grain crops including wheat

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,439
fabine soine chickpea and oil seed

125
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,800
across multiple sites and nitrogen rates

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,918
they found that grain yields were

127
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
consistently higher in inner crop and in

128
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,599
monoculture and that average grain yield

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,159
increased over time when compared to

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,360
monoculture inner species interactions

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,960
lead to effects like lead suppression

132
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,680
increases in nitrogen and carbon in the

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,038
top soil beneficial in refuge and

134
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,240
disease and pest suppression all of

135
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,439
these effects and more come together to

136
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,918
create the increases in yield land use

137
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,160
efficiency and stability documented in

138
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,839
intercrops now that we understand the

139
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,840
benefits of perennials kza and

140
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,679
intercropping in general let's look at

141
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:22,079
why we specifically chose alala to

142
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,519
intercop with our K Alfalfa is a leum

143
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,439
and legum symbiotically associate with

144
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,959
nitrogen fixing resal bacteria in the

145
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,800
soil and by trading carbon resources for

146
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,918
the nitrogen fix by these Rovia they

147
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,000
live in the nodules formed on the lum's

148
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,279
roots like you can see in the picture

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,600
here on the right and this nitrogen not

150
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,439
only benefits the legum crop and reduces

151
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,639
their need for synthetic Nitro

152
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,519
fertilization but also can contribute

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
nitrogen to the soils to be taken up by

154
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,758
other plants in the interring system

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
nitrogen transfer to soils and crops is

156
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,199
accomplished through root and nodule

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
tissue decomposition root exitation or

158
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,199
even directly from the legume to nearby

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,680
crops through plant Associated micro

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
mediated

161
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,319
transfer research has shown that legumes

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,399
in inner crop with non-legumes do have

163
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,479
the capacity to transfer as much

164
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,239
nitrogen for area as monoculture legumes

165
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,159
and if enough nitrogen can be

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,439
transferred from legumes to the other

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,680
crop and inner crop to still support

168
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,478
profitable Crop Production then less

169
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,598
synthetic nitrog fertilizer can be

170
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,598
applied overall to the inner crop

171
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,000
reducing both fertilizer cost and

172
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,319
Associated

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,199
emissions alala was selected for

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,280
intercropping with kza in the system

175
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,120
because it is a widely used profitable

176
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,719
and perennial forage crop Studies have

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,918
found that alpha alpha nitrogen

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,240
transferred to grasses like krenza

179
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,918
increases overtime with production year

180
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,478
indicating that its use in a perennial

181
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,758
inter croing system can not only confer

182
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,079
previously mentioned intercropping

183
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,759
benefits but also more nitrogen to the

184
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,079
system as each year

185
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,080
passes as alala is widely used there are

186
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,560
many varieties that have been sprad for

187
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,318
specific performance metrics one metric

188
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,079
is fall Dy rating which rates alala fall

189
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,280
regrowth on scale of 1 to 11 with one

190
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,240
having the least fall regrowth and 11

191
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,198
having the greatest fall regrowth fall

192
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,639
dorcy is Loosely correlated with winter

193
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,280
hardiness and fall dorcy ratings between

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,918
three and five are well suited for

195
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,679
northern states that experience soil

196
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,359
freezing and so we used ratings of three

197
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,240
to five in our Al varieties selected for

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,560
this experiment and here in this picture

199
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,038
we can see some alala and some Kenza in

200
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,639
our Crow together here at New York

201
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,038
so even if intercrop and kza with the

202
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,840
legum is able to help slow grain yield

203
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,598
Decline and reduce n fertilizer costs

204
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,918
Curr of grain still simply is not yet as

205
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,680
high yielding and thus not as profitable

206
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,598
when compared to annual wheat so farmers

207
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,439
interested in growing corenza may need

208
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,759
to tailor their management techniques to

209
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:56,879
man to maximize profit utilizing a dual

210
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,840
use system is one potential method a

211
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,919
dual use cropping system is one with the

212
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,399
intended purpose of both harvesting

213
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:06,598
grain and utilizing vegetative growth as

214
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,719
Forge for livestock economic analyses of

215
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,399
dual use systems have shown that can

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
both improve the profitability of a

217
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,038
cropping system and reduce business risk

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,000
additionally dual use systems can

219
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
provide a bridge and feed quality and

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,959
quantity gaps for livestock at different

221
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,758
times of the season analyses of cenza

222
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,158
systems have specifically shown that the

223
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
financial risk of KR of grain production

224
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,478
can be reduced by managing the system

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,679
for high forage yield thus providing the

226
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,958
farmer income not only from grain but

227
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,519
from its forage as well further

228
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,718
intercropping Al ala with Kenza would

229
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,360
then not only benefit farmer bottom

230
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,480
lines by increasing yields per area and

231
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,399
reducing notion fertilizer costs but

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,039
then also presents the opportunity for

233
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,679
multiple sources of income through the

234
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,399
Dual use cropping system that being said

235
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,799
though ideal current and management

236
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,159
strategies to maximiz profits are still

237
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,278
largely dependent on current grin prices

238
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,838
at Market which are still shifting as

239
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,078
the current of Market

240
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,279
develops so to summarize what we've

241
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,120
learned so far to help reduce

242
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,480
agriculturally Associated greenhouse gas

243
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,600
emissions we can utilize perennials over

244
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,600
annuals and Leverage The Yield benefits

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
from intercropping to help reduce

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,759
emissions and pollution Associated

247
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,639
nitrogen fertilizer production in use we

248
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,519
can utilize legumes and in crop to

249
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,000
provide biologically fixed nitrogen to

250
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,600
the system to help reduce grain yeld

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,600
decline in kernza intercropping bling

252
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,680
should be investigated and to help

253
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,720
kernza grain f makeup for small CS of

254
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,879
grand yelds compared to wheat they can

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,079
manage their system for dual

256
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,919
use now that we see the why of the

257
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,000
system we can finally get into the how

258
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,879
of our experimental objectives designs

259
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,519
and analyses in my first chapter we

260
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,958
investigated whether in our croping

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,120
Kenza without Alpa can reduce the need

262
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,119
for synthetic nitrogen fertilization

263
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,360
while maintaining or improving grain and

264
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,839
forage yields and quality compared to

265
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,800
monoculture we also St to understand how

266
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,680
yields changed over time in this inner

267
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,919
cropping system and different levels of

268
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,599
nitrogen fertilizer as well as how all

269
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,240
of these parameters varied based on

270
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,720
planting locations across the United

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,200
States and my second chapter we wanted

272
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,560
to understand how alop variety affects

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
the performance of this INR system and

274
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,359
compared alop varieties with three

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,959
different F

276
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,839
ratings so in order to understand the

277
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,919
effect of environment on the current Z

278
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,720
out the system we replicated this

279
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
experiment at four locations across the

280
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,839
United States here at Cornell University

281
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,000
of Wisconsin Madison University of

282
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,640
Minnesota and at the land Institute in

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Sal Kansas we had four replicates at

284
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,720
each location and 23 treatments in each

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,440
breath treatments included two cropping

286
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,399
schemes in our crops and monoculture our

287
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,399
monoculture plots were seeded at about

288
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,639
11.2 kilograms per hectare and our crop

289
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,120
plots were seated at 5.6 kilos per

290
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,079
hectare of each species in what was

291
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,519
known as a replacement in cropping

292
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,399
design which is where rows are replaced

293
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,759
with the second crop rather than the

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
second crop being planted in between

295
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,039
rows as we can see here Kansas itself

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
did have a slightly different planting

297
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,599
scheme due to planting equipment

298
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,119
limitations but those differences were

299
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,480
accounted for in the

300
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,039
analysis data collection included Curr

301
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,879
of grain yield Cur of Forge biomass and

302
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,360
off Apple forage biomass we also

303
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,278
collected weed biomass but did not

304
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,839
include it in the following

305
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,278
analyses we harvested both grain and

306
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,320
forage biomass in a quadrant basis by

307
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,919
hand and here we can see a hand

308
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,680
harvested plot from last summer in New

309
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,799
York we completed summer harvests of

310
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,039
grain and forage once grain reached

311
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,759
maturity and another harvest in the fall

312
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,519
before first Frost in year two locations

313
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,240
of available labor also harvested

314
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,278
biomass before currents of stem

315
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,839
elongation in the spring but spring

316
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,078
Harvest data was not included in the

317
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,399
following analyses after the spring

318
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,559
Harvest plots were mowed and Ura was

319
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
applied here we can see a picture of

320
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,039
alala biomass being harvested from a

321
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
quadrat in the fall the canas location

322
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,799
did did not have sufficient regrowth for

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,879
any fall harvests so we don't have their

324
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,439
data for that and we also don't have any

325
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,159
year 2 data for Minnesota as they had to

326
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,920
replant their experiment in the next

327
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,958
year due to rodent issues um each

328
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,278
replicate had both monoculture and

329
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,679
intercrop plots fertilized at one of

330
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,600
five different nitrogen rates increasing

331
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,958
in increments of 40 kilograms per

332
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,320
hectare from 0 to 160 kilg of nitrogen

333
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,359
FR we used three different alala

334
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,879
varieties Hest 360 with a fall Dy rating

335
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,600
of three Shockwave VR with a fall Dy

336
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,480
rating of four and WL 365 HQ with a fall

337
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,480
dcy rating of five only shock wave was

338
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,879
planted at all five nitrogen rates

339
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,079
because we didn't want to have hundreds

340
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,679
of plots at each location um so Hest and

341
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,519
WL were only planted at zero and 80

342
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,479
kilograms of I per hectare so we have

343
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
one big experimental design for both

344
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,360
chapters but use different subsets of

345
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,879
the data for analysis each chapter

346
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,480
of analysis after the Grain and biomass

347
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,679
was harvested Forge biomass was ground

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,800
and analyzed using Neo infrared

349
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,120
spectroscopy in our modeling of Forge

350
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,078
quality we use both crud protein values

351
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,759
and relative feed values because they

352
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,519
both indicate the nutritive quality and

353
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,838
usability in livestock the relative feed

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,240
value is calculated using parameters

355
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,800
from that NE infrared spectroscopy to

356
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,480
help understand the performance of

357
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,078
forage once fed to livestock we analyze

358
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
the forage quality of each species

359
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,958
separately so we also calculated a total

360
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,479
crude protein and total relative feed

361
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,319
value for inner crop plots by adjusting

362
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,600
the forage quality values based on the

363
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,000
proportion of biomass yield made up by

364
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,120
each species and despite breeding

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,240
efforts kza still has some threshability

366
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,639
problems meaning that the grain does not

367
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,039
always easily separate in its outer Hall

368
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,839
thus skewing some of the masses that we

369
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,159
got from our grain yield here we can see

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,720
some curs of grain still in its Hall and

371
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,958
here is some dehaul um so weuse a

372
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,480
digital imaging and analysis software to

373
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:07,078
estimate the proportion of dehal grade

374
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,920
in a given subsample which we then used

375
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,838
form adjustments on the total grain

376
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,879
yield for clock we were unable to

377
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,320
complete this Imaging yet for year two

378
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,519
so we used year one adjustments in order

379
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,680
to calculate the year two DEH hold grain

380
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,679
yields so please keep in mind that

381
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,719
technically the year two grain yield

382
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,838
results are preliminary moving

383
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,680
forward Forge harvests from each

384
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
quadrant were converted to a kilogram

385
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,439
per hectare yield and then both

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,159
mass-based yields and land inclement

387
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,880
ratios were modeled for biomass Harvest

388
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,958
more on land inclement ratios in the

389
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,278
next

390
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,039
slide linear mixed effects regression

391
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,039
models were created for each individual

392
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,958
Harvest because we did expect to see

393
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,599
large differences between both fall and

394
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,159
summer Harvest and year one and year two

395
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,320
results were log transformed to me

396
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,958
assumptions and post talk analyses

397
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,360
included analysis of variant and pawise

398
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,000
comparisons the factors that we included

399
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,360
in the nitrogen rate study were of

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
course nitrogen environment and cropping

401
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,278
system and factors included in the

402
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,320
variety study where genotype environment

403
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,480
and croing system so as mentioned lent

404
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,440
ratio our intercropping was in a

405
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,519
replacement design meaning that there's

406
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,800
half the seaing rate of each crop in in

407
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,440
crop compared to monoculture to be able

408
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,799
to compare the performance between

409
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,360
monoculture and in crops we can use the

410
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,319
land of clant ratio to visually explain

411
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,000
this if here in yellow we have a

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,959
monoculture of Kenza and here in green

413
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,039
we have a monoculture of alala covering

414
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,518
the same area and here we see our alala

415
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,318
cenza inner crab over the same area with

416
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,360
half the total area taken up by each

417
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,599
species we for example may expect to see

418
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,000
six kilos from a hectare of Kenza that

419
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,199
is not an accurate number but easy

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,120
numbers for the example um and we may

421
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,278
expect to see four kilos from a hectare

422
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,919
of alphalpha so with half of the seaing

423
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,399
rate in our inner crop we'd expect to

424
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,679
see half those yields in inner crop but

425
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
due to the

426
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,758
facilitative effects of intercropping

427
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,078
that lead to overyielding as discussed

428
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,639
earlier we often actually see greater

429
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,399
yields in a given land area like in this

430
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,159
example if we saw three kilos from Alpa

431
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,399
and four kilos from cran using these

432
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,039
expected and actual yields we can

433
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,278
calculate the partial land equivalent

434
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,958
ratio for each species and then sum them

435
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,759
to find the land equivalent ratio so

436
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,958
this example the partial L for corenza

437
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,199
would be the yield in in crop compared

438
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,479
to the yield in mon culture and if we

439
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,758
see a value greater than 0.5 for the

440
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,039
prod L we then see an over yielding

441
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,000
effect in that species the same

442
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,679
calculation can be done for alala

443
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,360
comparing intercrop to monoculture and

444
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,638
if we see a value greater than 0.5 we

445
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,839
see over yielding and we can add these

446
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,360
values together to figure out our land

447
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,800
flent ratio for an entire in our crop

448
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,519
plot and comparing expected or

449
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,679
overyielding to expected and if we see a

450
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,879
value greater than one we see over

451
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,119
yielding in the hole in our prop

452
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,798
plot so with that we can finally get

453
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,558
into some results for the niten rate

454
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,720
study um we'll start with brain yield so

455
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,639
for both years we saw significant

456
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,838
interactions between environment which

457
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,919
is eating the table and nitrogen rate

458
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,599
which is n in the table as well as

459
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,720
environment and cropping system which is

460
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,159
C in the table Our Stars indicate

461
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,000
significant levels from our anovas and

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,360
at a P value of 0.5 with more stars

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,079
indicating a greater degree of

464
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,159
significance

465
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,240
here we can see M mean grain value mean

466
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,080
grain yield values in kilograms per

467
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,359
hectare at each nitrogen rate at each

468
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,960
site with lines fitted from our linear

469
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,119
mixed effects regressions lines in red

470
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,640
are from year one data and lines in blue

471
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,879
are from your two data with dotted lines

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,360
being monoculture krenza and solid lines

473
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,160
being intercop data as we can see in the

474
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,439
graphs NE gen rate only had a

475
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
significant effect on Gran yield in New

476
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,679
York in year one and at Wisconsin in

477
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,519
year two for the sites that did not have

478
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,400
a significant difference in Grain yield

479
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,839
between nitrogen rates this indicates

480
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,240
that applying nitrogen does not

481
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,759
meaningfully increase grain yields in

482
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,960
either proing system so a farmer could

483
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,640
reduce or eliminate nitrogen application

484
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,840
while still maintaining great

485
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,280
yields with the environment by cropping

486
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,199
system interaction the effect of

487
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,079
cropping system did vary by sight but we

488
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,038
only see a significant difference in gr

489
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,359
yields between cropping systems in New

490
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,759
York and gear

491
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,639
one no signicant difference in Grain

492
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,200
yields between cropping systems shows

493
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,320
that despite half the seating rate of

494
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
corenza in in crop intercrop grain

495
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,279
yields were still comparable to

496
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,000
monoculture grain yields overall the

497
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,918
effects of environment that we do see

498
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,038
here and will see across many of our

499
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,038
response variables may come from a lot

500
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,440
of sources including variability and

501
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,519
temperature precipitation soil nutrient

502
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
loads soil types and wheat pressure just

503
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,440
to name a few for example here at New

504
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,200
York we had weed pressure in the form of

505
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,440
white clover which encroached on

506
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,798
monocultural curs of plots as the Clover

507
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,159
filled in the vacant leg Niche this

508
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,038
could have affected the nitrogen load in

509
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,039
the soil although we did still see an

510
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,440
effect of nitr rate in these plots in

511
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,679
New York another factor that may have

512
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,360
affected brain yields was lodging we did

513
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,679
observe lodging at high nutrtion rates

514
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,359
in both intercrop and monoculture and as

515
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,200
we can see here in this picture of

516
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,839
monoculture corenza at 160 kilg hect a

517
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,798
lodging may not only decrease grain

518
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,399
yield but also make the grain Harvest a

519
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,359
lot harder for Farmers through planting

520
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,320
to combine to PL grain

521
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,158
grain our grain partial land infl ratio

522
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,960
results support these claims about the

523
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,960
effect of croing system and nitrogen

524
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,759
rate on grain yield we did not see

525
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,798
significant effect of nitrogen rate on

526
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,359
grain fure l in either year indicating

527
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,079
that any overyielding effects are

528
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,038
independent of nitrogen

529
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,359
application these graphs show the

530
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,919
response of grain fure ler to nitrogen

531
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,959
rate in both years at all Sites the dash

532
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,200
red line is at 0.5 above which indicates

533
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,000
a yield advantage in INR

534
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,038
year one and year two grain partial ler

535
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,640
results showed that grain yields had a

536
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,679
yield advantage in the crop compared to

537
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,000
monoculture across rates and locations

538
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,360
except at New York in year one Kansas in

539
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,480
year two and at 160 kilograms of n per

540
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,158
hectare in year one if competence

541
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,159
intervals are taken into account we do

542
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,960
see some outliers at Kansas which may

543
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,400
have skewed the year one data in favor

544
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,038
of a gr yield advantage in in crop um

545
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,120
but as year 2 gr yields preliminary we

546
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,720
do hesitate to make any strong claims

547
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,879
about the effect of nitrogen rate or

548
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,079
Copic system on grain yields over time

549
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,200
we generally do observe that year two

550
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,399
grain partial L values were higher

551
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,319
across locations and nitrogen rates in

552
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,519
year two than year one which can

553
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,240
indicate that intercropping may help

554
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,879
amarate grain yelds declining over

555
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,240
time next we can look at the forage side

556
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,520
of this dual use system there was a

557
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,480
three-way nitrogen rate environment

558
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,079
proin system interaction in year One

559
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,919
Summer year one fall in year two summer

560
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,038
as well as a significant effect of

561
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,159
environment as well as a nitrogen rate

562
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,319
by cobic System interaction in year two

563
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,039
fall which highlights that total forage

564
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,359
yield reaction to cropping system and

565
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,319
nitrogen rate is very sight specific

566
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,719
which does make sense as for yields can

567
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,278
be highly dependent on site specific and

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,919
annually variable factors like

569
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,759
precipitation temperature and nutrient

570
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,400
availability now would also be a good

571
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,240
time to recognize that the alphalpha

572
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,798
stands were not managed in a typical

573
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,599
carb pattern usually alphalpha stands

574
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,839
are harvested multiple times over a

575
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,119
summer growing season which maximizes

576
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,240
forage yields and quality but because

577
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,359
our currs of forage cannot be harvested

578
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,558
in the summer to avoid disrupting brain

579
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,678
development Alfalfa also cannot be

580
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,519
harvested in inner crop so we also

581
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,200
didn't Harvest monoculture alphaalpha

582
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,158
until green yield time as well in this

583
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,319
picture you can see our senior research

584
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,600
associate Julie Hansen holding up some

585
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,678
of this late summer monoculture Al Alpa

586
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,199
you can see it's very stemy it's lost l

587
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,759
of it leaves and therefore it's going to

588
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,798
have a pretty low forage quality um but

589
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,240
because we're most most interested in

590
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,519
comparing inner crop plots to

591
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
monoculture parenza just to see how the

592
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,639
prev presence of alphaalpha benefits

593
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,839
overall yield and quality we still

594
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,200
included monoculture alphalpha as a

595
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,199
benchmark that being said here we have

596
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,319
some graphs of our total forage biomass

597
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,880
yields by nitrogen rate cing system and

598
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,558
location we now have three lines

599
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,080
comparing inner crop to monoculture

600
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,519
Kenza and monoculture alala with a

601
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,278
different color and representing

602
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,119
different harvests across the two years

603
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,200
we only saw a significant response of

604
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,918
nitr rate in monoculture perza where

605
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,960
there was a positive correlation between

606
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,360
nitrogen rate and total forage yield

607
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,038
which is expected for a grass that

608
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,599
cannot fix its

609
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:48,240
own we also saw in New York in year one

610
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,038
in their fall Harvest there was an

611
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
inverse relationship between nitrogen

612
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,158
rate and total forage yield in in crop

613
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
plots because we do not see a

614
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
significant positive response to

615
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,278
nitrogen in intercop plots this inter

616
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
this indic Ates that intercropping Kenza

617
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,000
with Al alfha provides the opportunity

618
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,320
to reduce or eliminate nutrtion

619
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
fertilizer application and costs will

620
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,240
still maintaining High total forage

621
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,400
yields when compared to monoculture

622
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,519
current Zone additionally we found that

623
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,320
intercrop total forage yield was

624
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,319
significantly higher in monoculture

625
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:21,839
corenza across Nation rates in the fall

626
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:24,399
Harvest of both years we did not see

627
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,038
this effect in summer Harvest but some

628
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,320
locations did have higher summer total

629
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,720
forage yields at lower rates than

630
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:33,439
monoculture corenza a higher total

631
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,600
forage yield in intercrop during fall

632
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,400
harvests but not summer harvests shows

633
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,439
that a system like this may be best for

634
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,120
grain Farmers looking to get higher

635
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,159
yields and qualities from their fall

636
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,839
forages but that still recognize that

637
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,960
their inner crop summer forage yields

638
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,399
may not necessarily be higher than Kenzo

639
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,240
monoculture across cropping systems we

640
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,559
generally saw a decrease between years

641
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,159
one and two summer Harvest total forage

642
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,759
as expected however intercrop total

643
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,640
forage yield was higher High than

644
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,879
monoculture Curr a total Forge yield

645
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,759
from your to Summer Harvest indicating

646
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,240
that the farmers could benefit from a

647
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,720
greater total Forge yield over time with

648
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,200
the inner crop then monoculture

649
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,798
kzone we saw the most dramatic changes

650
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,519
in total board yield over time in Kansas

651
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,599
across all cropping systems in year one

652
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,158
we did observe a much higher total mon

653
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,319
precipitation at Kansas in the late

654
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,399
spring compared to year two so our

655
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,759
hypothesis is that this precipitation

656
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,079
may have increased soil water

657
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,679
availability during either critical grow

658
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,079
growth periods or just throughout the

659
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,000
entire growing season which could Boler

660
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,839
forage yields and actually make the year

661
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,359
one for a yields more of the outlier

662
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,319
than year

663
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,119
two we can look at our ler results again

664
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,319
to understand whether intercropping

665
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,278
convered a total forage yield Advantage

666
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,519
compared to

667
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,839
biculture we only see a significant

668
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,599
response to n rate in year two summer

669
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,519
where there was an inverse relationship

670
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,918
between nitrogen and ler indicating that

671
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,119
Forge yield advantage in an ACR is more

672
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,159
likely at lower nitrogen rates in other

673
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,798
words a higher nitrogen fertilizer

674
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,640
application in monoculture is more

675
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:09,960
likely to match any yield Advantage

676
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,440
conferred by intercropping than a low

677
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,079
nitrogen rate overall ler results

678
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,360
consistently showed an advantage for

679
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,199
intercropping across nitrogen rates

680
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,639
except at 120 to 160 kilograms of

681
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,360
nitrogen per hectare the year One Summer

682
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,559
and 160 kilograms a year

683
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,479
two we saw the L values were higher in

684
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,879
year two than in year one for both

685
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,960
summer and fall harvest in Wisconsin for

686
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,559
summer harvest in New York and at low

687
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,519
ntion rates in Kansas a greater yield

688
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,158
advantage in in crop in year two is

689
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,200
likely tied with the fact that root and

690
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,960
nodule DEC composition is the main

691
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,038
mechanism for nitrogen transfer from

692
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,240
legumes and these tissues just have had

693
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,359
more time to turn over by gear

694
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,720
two so while Forge biomass yields are

695
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,918
important forage quality is extremely

696
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,839
important when feeding forage to

697
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,559
livestock and therefore can a large

698
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,839
impact on

699
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,720
profitability we saw a significant

700
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,839
three-way interaction in year One Summer

701
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,319
and varying interactions between the

702
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,439
factors for other harvests while our

703
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,398
Nova results tell us that nitrogen rate

704
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,880
had a significant effect on total fruit

705
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,639
protein we in fact see that there was no

706
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,200
significant difference in total cruit

707
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
protein between nitrogen rates within a

708
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,759
given cropping system and location

709
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,959
monoculture alphalpha total cre protein

710
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,319
was significantly higher than

711
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,079
monoculture Kenza which is expected When

712
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,720
comparing a leum to a

713
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,720
grass total forage crud protein values

714
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,480
in inner crop plots were higher than

715
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,480
monoculture corenza regardless of

716
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,519
nitrogen rate this indicates that inter

717
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,960
croing corenza with the legum does in

718
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,599
fact confer a forage forage quality

719
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,840
benefit however the inverse relationship

720
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,359
between total CW protein and nitrogen

721
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,240
rate in New York more Harvest that we

722
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,719
can see here was contrary to

723
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,919
expectations that providing more

724
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,159
nitrogen to the system would reduce

725
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,000
nitrogen scarcity in their or increased

726
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,559
total gr protein one hypothesis is that

727
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,519
this may have been due to higher

728
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,440
nitrogen availability leading to a

729
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,519
greater nitrogen allocation to the grain

730
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,880
rather than the forage but as we don't

731
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,879
have grain quality data this hypothesis

732
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,399
cannot yet be tested overall both the

733
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,559
general lack of effect of nitrogen on

734
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:21,158
the total cruit protein as well as that

735
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,000
decrease in total cruit protein with

736
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,880
increaseing nitrogen indicates that

737
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,079
farmers in croing currents and alphalpha

738
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,039
could again save money while maintaining

739
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,439
forage quality by decreasing their

740
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,798
synthetic nit

741
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,519
applications we also observed that fall

742
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,519
Harvest had higher improv protein than

743
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,480
summer Harvest which was expected with a

744
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,200
shorter regrowth period between summer

745
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,319
and fall Harvest compared to Spring

746
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,278
Harvest and summer Harvest while not

747
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,558
statistically compared we also generally

748
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,839
saw that year 2 crude protein values

749
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,038
were equal to or greater than year one

750
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,480
values which is expected again with

751
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,839
transferring more nitrogen over time as

752
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,839
tissues

753
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:00,839
decompose all right so for total

754
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,120
relative feed value we only saw a

755
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,240
three-way interaction in year two summer

756
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,199
but nitrogen rate only had a significant

757
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,440
effect on total RFB in in crop plots in

758
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Kansas in year two summer where total

759
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,759
RFB decreased with increasing ntion rate

760
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,080
here we do that additionally at New York

761
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,960
and Wisconsin in year two summer there

762
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,639
was no significant differences in total

763
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,079
RFB across cring systems and nitrogen

764
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,799
rates this with the fact that we did not

765
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,960
see a significant effect of nitrogen

766
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:32,200
during other harvests indicates that

767
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,200
there is no total RFB advantage to

768
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,120
applying nitrogen to intercropped Cur

769
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,440
alal systems while we saw significant

770
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,518
cropping system effects across harvests

771
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,399
intercrop total RFB was generally

772
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,200
greater than or equal to RFB in

773
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:49,558
monoculture crza acrost locations and

774
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,159
harvests both Total CP and total RFB

775
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,440
were generally higher in Fall Harvest

776
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,000
and summer Harvest across locations prop

777
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,759
systems and N rates though we did not

778
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,119
yet analyze spring Harvest we would

779
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,839
expect to find similar things with

780
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,038
spring quality higher than summer

781
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,079
quality this higher quality forage in

782
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,000
these marginal Seasons could be more

783
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,480
valuable to Farmers by helping Bridge

784
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,119
any existing heat quality gaps after the

785
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,919
main forage growing

786
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,439
season so to recap our results from the

787
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,759
nitrogen rate study we did not see a

788
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,558
significant effect of nitrogen on grain

789
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,119
total forage yields or total forage

790
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,720
quality in intercop intercropping

791
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,359
significantly increased fall total

792
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,360
forage yields and intercropping

793
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,519
increased forage quality when compared

794
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,398
to monoculture corenza and while not yet

795
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,960
modeled we generally observe that grain

796
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,439
yields did decline over time but

797
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
preliminary results indicate that

798
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,120
intercropping may decrease the rate of

799
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,720
grain yield decline over time these

800
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,079
results indicate that a dual use

801
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,839
intercropped Curr alpha alpha system may

802
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,720
be a viable route for maintaining Curr

803
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,678
of grain production for more profitable

804
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,519
Farm uh more profitable systems for

805
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,559
Farmers when compared to monoculture

806
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,240
Kenza by reducing n input needs and at

807
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,798
those lower nuring rates increasing

808
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,759
grain and forage yield over time over a

809
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,519
given area increasing forage quality and

810
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,119
potentially maintaining higher grain

811
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,240
yields Over time however to truly

812
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,199
identify the best system further work

813
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,440
must be done to understand the cost and

814
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,038
benefits of the Curr cenza alphalpha

815
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,919
system based on the cost of nitrogen and

816
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,200
the value of the Grain and forage yields

817
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,960
over time based on the markets most

818
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
readily available to

819
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,079
Farmers hopefully you're still with me

820
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,278
we have just a few more slides of

821
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,798
results for the alphalpha variety study

822
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:37,359
which are luckily pretty

823
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,158
straightforward um so first of all even

824
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,599
though we only fertilized all three of

825
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,399
the varieties at two nitrogen rates we

826
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,558
found that there was no significant

827
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,918
interaction between nitrogen rate and

828
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,440
variety for any of the response

829
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,399
variables so we removed nitrogen as a

830
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,798
factor in all models there were also no

831
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,638
significant genotype by Crossing system

832
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,319
genotype by environment or three-way

833
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,439
interactions for any of our response

834
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,398
variables which indicates that no one

835
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,000
variety is better suited to a single

836
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,678
environment than another nor are any

837
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,359
varieties better suited to inter crop

838
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,600
with than another we did see significant

839
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,079
environment by cropping system

840
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,079
interactions indicating that

841
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,000
intercropping success does vary with

842
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,558
environment which is what we also saw in

843
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,079
the last chapter so we'll start with our

844
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,440
forage and grain yield results I promise

845
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,278
this slide is not as scary as it looks

846
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,558
um we did not include currents and

847
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,880
monoculture yields in total forage

848
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:32,759
quality or models because there is no

849
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,240
level of variety of alphalpha from cza

850
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:38,480
monoculture so for cza yields we only

851
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,880
looked at variety performance in in crop

852
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,480
that being said we did see an effect of

853
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,080
variety on alala forage yields and total

854
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,200
forage yields in year one for both

855
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,199
alphaalpha yield and total forage yield

856
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,159
the variety shock wve V led to

857
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,840
significantly higher summer yield than

858
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,320
WL 365 HQ and significantly higher fall

859
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,720
yield than in highest this indicates

860
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,240
that out of three varieties Shockwave v

861
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,880
may be the most profitable choice for

862
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,319
for yelds at least in year one its

863
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,760
performance may have been correlated

864
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,519
with the B dorcy rating but it also may

865
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,240
have had additional attributes not

866
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,319
Quantified in the study that may have

867
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,120
led to higher total forage yields while

868
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,519
there's no significant differences in

869
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:21,479
alphalpha or total forage yield in year

870
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,798
two additional data in year three May

871
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,240
better eluate the trend in total foral

872
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,000
changes over

873
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,159
time with the environment by crop

874
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,960
actions intercrop total forage yields

875
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,720
were higher than monoculture across

876
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,798
sites and harvests we did not see any

877
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,880
effect of genotype on currents of forage

878
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:42,759
or grain yields which indicates that no

879
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,760
one variety increases currenty yields in

880
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:48,240
in crop more than

881
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,960
another we did not see a significant

882
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,599
effect of genotype on total ler across

883
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Harvest indicating that no one variety

884
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,439
leads to a greater forage over yielding

885
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,798
effect in a crop compared to the other

886
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
variety

887
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,398
while no variety was statistically

888
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,759
greater than another all the variety's

889
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,278
total L confidence intervals did exceed

890
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,278
one indicating a re yielding effect

891
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,119
except for shock wve VR in year One

892
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,398
Summer which is interesting considering

893
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,959
we did see it had higher total forage

894
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,719
yields like in the nitrogen rate study

895
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,880
we did see a sign significant effect on

896
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,798
environment in total L as we can see

897
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,039
these box plots and we might not see it

898
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,359
in these graphs because they're on

899
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,759
different scales but we did see a total

900
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,479
ler that was greater in Fall than in

901
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,000
summer

902
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,159
harvests so we see similar Trends in

903
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Grain partial ler there were no

904
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,000
significant effects of genotype across

905
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,839
years which indicates that no one

906
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,679
variety leads to a higher grain yield

907
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,678
Advantage andr than another while no

908
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,720
variety was statistically greater than

909
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,600
another confidence intervals indicated

910
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,000
that a grain yield advantage in a croing

911
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:59,959
is likely for both shock wve BR and Hest

912
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
360 in year one but not for WL 365 HQ

913
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,919
variety performance in in crop again

914
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,960
varies with environment and we saw in

915
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,398
year one in New York confidence

916
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
intervals actually did not show that

917
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:13,239
intercropping gave a grin yield

918
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,839
Advantage for any variety which may have

919
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,158
been related to the lodging we've

920
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:20,078
discussed

921
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,519
previously so for our forage quality

922
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,119
there was no significant effect of

923
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,480
genotype on total CW protein or total

924
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,559
relative feed value which indicates that

925
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,000
no one variety prefers forage quality

926
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,599
advantage in inner crop over another

927
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,679
while the effect was not uniform across

928
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,119
environments there's generally a lower

929
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,838
total crude protein in total relative

930
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,599
feed value in inner crop compared to

931
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:44,279
monocultural Alpa which is expected with

932
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,679
the lower proportion of lanss inner crop

933
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,679
while we did not include monoculture

934
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
crims and Analysis we would expect there

935
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,720
to be lower forage quality than

936
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,760
intercrop as SE in the previous chapter

937
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,279
as and as well we would also expect to

938
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,440
see no effect on currents of forage

939
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,760
quality from genotype

940
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,000
to summarize our findings for the

941
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,040
alphaalpha variety study out of the

942
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,239
three varieties tested we did not find

943
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:07,519
one to be better suited to the

944
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,358
environments tested and we did not find

945
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,800
one to be best suited to intercop perza

946
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,039
we did find that variety had a

947
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,119
significant effect on Al for yield and

948
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:18,358
total forage yield in year one with

949
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,039
shockwave BR more consistently providing

950
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,199
a higher yield than the other two

951
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,079
varieties variety did not have a

952
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,439
significant effect on currents of grain

953
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,680
yield or forage yield total forage of

954
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,720
grain over yielding forage quality while

955
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,159
we saw some effect of variety on total

956
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:36,199
forage yields we cannot definitively say

957
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,920
that this was effect of qu dorcy rating

958
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,199
of Shockwave as this was a rather narrow

959
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,720
study only using three varieties of

960
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,679
three fall dmy ratings which may not

961
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,480
have actually been representative of the

962
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:50,919
Fall Dy group we also only tested these

963
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,318
varieties across four locations and

964
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,519
there may have been other attributes of

965
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,639
the varieties besides fall Normy rating

966
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,759
that contributed the role in these

967
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,719
results to bring together all of our

968
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,079
findings from this cenza alphaalpha in

969
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,799
propic experiment our results show that

970
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,880
a farmer focused on cenza grain yield

971
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,880
production could potentially benefit

972
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,880
from a dual use corenza alphaalpha in

973
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,599
our cin system with brain yeld

974
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,760
advantages during the summer and a

975
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,000
higher Forge biomass of higher quality

976
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,079
in the fall while increasing profits

977
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,519
through synthetic nitrogen need

978
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,680
reduction we also found that fall dormy

979
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,960
reading may not have an effect on

980
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,838
alphaalpha variety performance in the CR

983
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,598
findings we recognize the study was

984
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,719
limited we only have two years of data

985
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,920
only four locations and only three ala

varieties with only three full Dy

987
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,280
ratings there's plenty of work to study

988
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,519
and future studies could continue to do

989
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,359
to overcome these limitations to better

990
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,639
improve our understanding of the Dual

992
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,440
we plan to include a third year of

00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,039
harvest data next year and longer term

994
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,880
studies are generally important for

00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,759
perennial systems both this study and

996
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,240
future studies could be improved through

997
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,040
more thorough modeling of relevant

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,960
and will continue to be important as we

1007
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,119
pursue larger grain sizes and yields

1008
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,280
slower yield toin and optimize currer

1009
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,680
for use in inner crop and of course

1010
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,000
there's plenty of other management

1011
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,399
effects that could be investigated

1012
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,159
Beyond n

1013
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,240
fertilization different Health Alpha

1014
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,399
varieties should be tested for or bred

1015
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,879
for inner crop more work on that coming

1016
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,318
soon um and overall while findings are

1017
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,838
promising economic analyses will be very

1018
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:52,039
important to understand how reducing n

1019
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,039
fertilization and intercropping and a je

1020
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,800
use system actually affects

1021
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,759
profitability in Farmer bottom lines

1022
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,079
with that I'd like to thank my committee

1023
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,680
members for the guidance and kindness

1024
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,000
and my collaborators for their patience

1025
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,960
and support I'd like to thank my lab

1026
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,800
members for all the laughs in the field

1027
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,639
and all the help in the field and of

1028
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,440
course my friends and family for their

1029
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,400
unwavering love and support it was such

1030
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,358
a privilege to work on this project and

1031
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,079
I really love my time at Cornell but I'm

1032
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:20,838
also very excited for my next chapter

1033
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,560
back in Virginia and with that thank you

1034
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:23,838
all for your time and please feel free

1035
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,440
to ask any

1036
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,440
questions

1037
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,440
about logic did you

1038
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,079
environment so we did not analyze that

1039
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:38,480
but we did largely observe it mostly at

1040
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,839
New York in year two um other locations

1041
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,519
definitely have observed it um and there

1042
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,440
is some work saying that lodging rate is

1043
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,759
likely associated with higher ntion

1044
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,119
rates um but no one has specifically

1045
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,880
looked at environment effect that yeah

1046
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,119
but we except way very naive question

1047
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,920
about these systems I know they're going

1048
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,160
to have to be renovated like alala has

1049
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,760
to be renovated how long do these go

1050
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:05,759
before typically you repl and you

1051
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,160
renovate the whole right so that's one

1052
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,960
of the problems with the currens of

1053
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:13,199
forage yield def so in my first graph we

1054
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,000
saw that those uh intermediate we grass

1055
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,239
successions they declined after one year

1056
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,760
typically the literature says that they

1057
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,479
yield decline is after two years and for

1058
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,160
forage yield decline we typically see

1059
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,358
them after around three years for both

1060
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,358
kza and Al Alpha so right now we're

1061
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,318
looking at Farmers um probably wanting

1062
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:32,358
to renovate after three years but the

1063
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:34,239
more work we can do on the system to

1064
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,559
keep yields higher for longer we're

1065
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,879
going to have that three perennial that

1066
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,358
fit over time so the the typical

1067
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,720
alphalpha renovation would then be your

1068
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:47,480
cycle because the turns it with

1069
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,399
keep

1070
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,880
yes

1071
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,599
question think

1072
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,559
inter that is the question um a large

1073
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,359
part of it is is thought that by keeping

1074
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:04,440
nitrogen rates consistent and higher

1075
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,318
over time in the field then we reduce

1076
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,159
that limitation and make sure that gra

1077
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,159
meals get Stay High um and also it might

1078
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:15,559
just be one of those incing effects that

1079
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,679
have not been fully understood yet um it

1080
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah I think there's still more work

1081
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,039
that needs to be done there to truly

1082
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,159
understand the effects of that yeah I

1083
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,159
think Jake's work found that

1084
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,480
y

1085
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,480
totally fellow kza kza

1086
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,760
homie

1087
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:54,199
yes

1088
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,199
question understand you're saying you're

1089
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,639
notec but it not

1090
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:09,280
protein but not effects where's all

1091
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,279
[Music]

1092
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,800
the what part of the system

1093
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:21,279
going that is a great question so the

1094
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,200
question is about if we're not seeing a

1095
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,400
nitrogen effect where is that nitrogen

1096
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,159
going in the system is it running off is

1097
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,639
it going to weeds um those both options

1098
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,318
so when we're not seeing a nitrogen

1099
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,838
effect in inner crop it is essentially

1100
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,920
because the legum is helping provide

1101
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,480
enough nitrogen that the cenza does not

1102
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,079
need to continue to forage for the

1103
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,599
excess nitrogen um so we would expect it

1104
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,800
to either stay in the system or go to

1105
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:52,800
beads or run off um or potentially if

1106
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,160
there are any other changes in um

1107
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,079
nutrient balances maybe go into other

1108
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,078
organisms within the system

1109
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,960
yes no I totally agree so we did some

1110
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,119
baseline testing on our soils but it was

1111
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,480
not in depth I'm not sure if all Lo Pati

1112
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,440
actually tested um and that was mostly

1113
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,760
just to make sure that our nitrogen and

1114
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:23,838
our potassium and our potassium and our

1115
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,040
sulfur and our what am I you know the

1116
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,358
big ones yes phosphorus thank you making

1117
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:31,159
sure that they were all in Balance um

1118
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:33,719
but I think that more in depth like

1119
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,799
analysis of nitrogen cycling throughout

1120
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,039
the whole system would be really

1121
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,480
interesting to understand where

1122
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,480
everything is

1123
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,519
going yeah good question um so we handh

1124
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:57,639
harvested let me see if I can find a

1125
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,039
good example

1126
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,920
what we

1127
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:05,480
did um here so you see how I'm basically

1128
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,318
grab a bundle you basically cut the gr

1129
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,000
heads off the bottom we dry them we

1130
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,679
brush them but that's hard mode that is

1131
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,719
experimental mode um theoretically we

1132
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,358
can use combines one of our locations

1133
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,759
Kansas actually did use a combine to

1134
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,199
harvest in year two because they had

1135
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,640
limited data or limited labor for hand

1136
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,919
harvesting so and we do have some

1137
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,519
Farmers that are actually growing

1138
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,119
parenza on farm and they use a combine

1139
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:29,119
that

1140
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,480
yeah thank you very much Megan that was

1141
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,720
great lot of work U and a lot of

1142
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,358
intriguing data work you do I was

1143
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:44,078
wondering whether you had nitrogen

1144
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:46,799
uptake data and you could calculate from

1145
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,519
the tradeoff between adding nitrogen and

1146
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,519
the lack of nitrogen uptake or or

1147
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:56,079
somewhat a nitrogen transfer

1148
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:58,000
equivalence from leum to non leum to

1149
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,920
answer May question I'll provide some

1150
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,480
find points on the mechanisms why

1151
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,720
nitrogen doesn't increase Feld because

1152
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,199
it's a tradeoff between getting from the

1153
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:12,919
legum and getting fertilizer and

1154
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:15,960
somewhat cleverly use the data to

1155
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,000
calculate that transfer rate yeah so we

1156
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,318
actually did calculate a parameter that

1157
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,039
we called relative field which actually

1158
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,519
a lot of things but the way we

1159
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:30,000
calculated it we compared inter crops

1160
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:33,480
plots at zero zero nitrogen rate to

1161
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,480
monoculture plots of perza and alala at

1162
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,599
the different nitrogen rate levels and

1163
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,599
using that proportion then we could

1164
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:45,079
basically estimate how the inner crop

1165
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,680
clots with no NES fertilizer compared to

1166
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:52,280
fertilizer effects in other plots um so

1167
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:53,838
we kind of did do some fun data stuff to

1168
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,040
approximate that but we didn't really

1169
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:59,480
find any results that were surprising

1170
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,558
more exciting or necessarily worth

1171
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,000
including in a 45 minutes but I do have

1172
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,599
that in my paper if you would like to

1173
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,199
see that time but I agree I think a more

1174
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,800
thorough understanding of where the

1175
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:11,799
nitrogen is going in system is really

1176
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,879
important um I had two considered two

1177
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:20,039
questions one is do you know the the

1178
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,880
yield decline that you get in the second

1179
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,119
year has anybody looked at nitrogen

1180
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,200
immobilization by the microbes are you

1181
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,838
sort of feeding the microbes and instead

1182
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,318
of feeding the crop when you're adding

1183
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:34,639
that fertilizer and then a follow-up

1184
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:37,000
question to that is how much is the

1185
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,078
yield declin been investigated in out

1186
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,159
years so if you waited three four five

1187
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,559
years to your yield start coming back

1188
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:45,199
because something is changing below

1189
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,960
ground and they basically just stay low

1190
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,598
uh for your first question um we have

1191
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,119
not specifically investigated that yet

1192
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,318
in the system seeing whether

1193
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,480
mobilization is a large factor in that

1194
00:45:52,318 --> 00:46:00,039
decline um and in terms of whether or

1195
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,358
not we see uh regression basically um I

1196
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,039
have not seen any of that in the

1197
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:07,239
literature it pretty typically is just a

1198
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,119
steady downward decline um and there's a

1199
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,719
lot of thought on what may be causing

1200
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,920
that um some of it is greater amounts of

1201
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,719
leaing out and tillering well not

1202
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:22,680
tillering but um basically reallocation

1203
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:22,679
of resources away from brain and towards

1204
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,558
bionas yes Jenice

1205
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,720
yes good question and the question for

1206
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,880
people don't here um was whether or not

1207
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:47,118
we actually checked if the alphalpha had

1208
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,640
any nodulation going on so we did use uh

1209
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,800
pre-treated seed for the alphalpha so we

1210
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:54,358
hopefully saw some RI Association but we

1211
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,480
did not check nodulation rates so we

1212
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:59,880
were just assuming that the Rises were

1213
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,079
doing their job down there um and with

1214
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,800
the results that we saw at low nitrogen

1215
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,119
rates in intercropping we assume that

1216
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,318
they were giving some nitrogen um but

1217
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,280
with the fact that intercropping itself

1218
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:15,079
even without legums in the system can

1219
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,640
still contribute over yielding effects

1220
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,318
then it is hard to untangle that so we

1221
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:20,719
did not check nodules but we do assume

1222
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:22,960
that there were at least some doing

1223
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,959
their

1224
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,838
drop if not

1225
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,199
yes acoss

1226
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,759
thees n

1227
00:47:54,159 --> 00:48:00,920
application yeah so n application was

1228
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,760
done in the spring um basically during

1229
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,119
regrowth right after spring mowing um so

1230
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,559
around April early May time frame and

1231
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,960
all the NS applied just as at one point

1232
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,440
in the year um and we could potentially

1233
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,280
see different effects if we did a split

1234
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,280
oblation the year but that's not the

1235
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,440
experimental design we went with um in

1236
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,960
terms of weed control we largely let

1237
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,159
that um left that up to sites so we know

1238
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,599
that for example with or Minnesota I

1239
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:28,799
think did some spraying for shepherd's

1240
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,599
first um and Kansas Kansas had plent

1241
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,280
problems they had aloh bevel they had

1242
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,280
spray for different

1243
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,079
um yeah so each site only did their

1244
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,319
management as they saw fit so like New

1245
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,599
York we didn't really do much management

1246
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:47,000
and we certainly saw plenty of clover we

1247
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,200
saw um we see a lot of perennial weeds

1248
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,798
in the system as people know in

1249
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,919
perennial systems you have a shift

1250
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:58,880
towards peral we l Timothy we have

1251
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,960
Canadian pistle all that so and even our

1252
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,680
reps varied and how weedy it was um but

1253
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,798
yes weed management is one of the large

1254
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,719
problems in theal system can't just

1255
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:10,559
especially with a system that both has

1256
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,838
grasses in it can't you know you have

1257
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,519
different modes of action when you're

1258
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:18,798
spray can't necessarily you know just

1259
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,798
blanket apply any we

1260
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,000
treatments he thanks thanks all for
