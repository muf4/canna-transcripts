1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:15,678
University would U I was asked by Neil

3
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:17,759
to uh continue this General topic of

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,359
horticulture and a changing climate that

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,320
they've had for the semester and asked

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
me to to talk about fruit crops and

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,518
especially apples and grapes that I've

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:33,119
worked on for uh quite a long time and

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,238
uh so I uh would be happy to do that I

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,479
would like to acknowledge Rd Gano from

11
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,000
the climate Center um and also Dave wol

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,799
from Jonathan comto as we've worked a

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,600
lot together over the last year or so on

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,038
a project funded by Nera the energy

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,840
research and development uh project to

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,280
look at climate effects on um uh various

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,239
aspects it's a very broad ranging

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,480
project uh on uh climate effects on New

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,640
York so I've been focusing on the apples

20
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,200
and grapes and would like to give you a

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,879
quick overview of what we think are some

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,000
of the uh important factors that are

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,280
occurring now as well as in the future

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,959
but a lot of the climate information is

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,719
from art uh so I have to definitely

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,759
acknowledge contributions there so

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,879
really some of the key questions are uh

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,359
you know has our climate been changing

29
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,519
recently already I me are we just

30
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,759
looking at potential uh climate change

31
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,679
or are we really talking about uh a

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,079
continuation of climate change uh what

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,799
happen some of the effects on apples and

34
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,599
grapes uh in New York due to the climate

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,320
change and then uh what changes are

36
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:54,919
expected U for our climate uh over the

37
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,718
next 15 20 30 40 70 80 years or so uh

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,159
and what are likely to be some of those

39
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,038
effects um obviously there's lots things

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,039
you can talk about um but first let's

41
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,878
let's just see you know um point out

42
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,640
that the climate is already changing uh

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,560
there's really not too much doubt about

44
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,199
that um especially in the last 40 or 50

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,878
years uh the annual temperatures across

46
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,598
New York it warmed by almost 2 degrees

47
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,159
Fahrenheit which is a major change on a

48
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,639
climatic scale uh the winter

49
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,680
temperatures are warm by nearly 5

50
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,839
degrees

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,439
F uh so the uh Winters are tending to

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,360
warm up more than the uh Summers which

53
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,280
is generally good for most of us we're

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,280
willing to let the War uh the winter to

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,120
warm up more um and then the date of

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,878
last spring Frost has become um quite a

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,640
bit earlier I'll show some data on that

58
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:53,399
um and that there are about two more

59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,518
days per year uh over 90 Dees Fahrenheit

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,959
um and of course that varies with your

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
location in the state but there's been a

62
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,719
an increase in numbers of very hot days

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,319
as well um this is a plot from art just

64
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,680
showing the the general Trend over about

65
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,679
100 Years of the

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,599
U the uh Top Line of the black

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,959
regression lines is the 100-year trend

68
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,158
which is about almost 3 degrees warming

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,000
over the last 100 years uh but he also

70
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:30,318
made a regression from

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,400
1970 uh or 1980 I guess it be um sorry

72
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,359
1970 this stops in

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,360
2000 um of course we've we've had some

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,519
of the hottest years since that um grass

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,920
stop so uh the regression since about

76
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,239
1970 has been quite a bit steeper with

77
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,039
about four and a half degree warming

78
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,480
over the last 30 years which is not only

79
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,878
a large amount of warming but it's a

80
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,158
large amount of warming over a very

81
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:59,000
short time period um and as I mentioned

82
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,719
the winters have been warming more than

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,840
the Summers

84
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,120
um this U is from a project with uh that

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,200
art worked with us on for the grape

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,719
industry but basically uh took his

87
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,238
highresolution uh algorithms to estimate

88
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,639
temperatures between weather stations to

89
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,679
get more of a high

90
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,600
resolution um map of uh temperatures and

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,519
we had him go backwards for about 30

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,000
years and generate these high resolution

93
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,839
estimates of daily temperatures uh

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,600
backwards for about 30 years so we could

95
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,638
summarize them over a 30-year period

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
which is really what you need to look at

97
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,840
at climatic change rather than just five

98
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,839
or 10 years U but what we could see is

99
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:50,599
even in that short period uh these plots

100
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:54,719
are uh the U average number of days per

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,840
year with temperatures below minus1 Fen

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,960
that's a threshold value for uh grapes

103
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:06,198
especially uh uh for grape bun kill for

104
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,478
benifer grapes the premium wine grapes

105
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,639
so that's sort of a a key temperature

106
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:15,560
for the uh uh winter hardiness issue for

107
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:19,800
grapes um and so on the uh on the top

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,120
left you can see the plot uh in which on

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,840
the uh uh the left side of the scale or

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,519
the warmer temperatures the Reds and

111
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,959
oranges yellows are warmer and then the

112
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:34,359
blues and pures greens are colder and so

113
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,120
in the upper left you can see the during

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,240
that 1980 to

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,639
1990 uh period uh what the uh General

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,280
Distribution was and you can see why uh

117
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,918
The Grapes the wine grapes that are

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,638
growing are growing in the Finger Lakes

119
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,839
uh near the Lakes um a little bit up

120
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,160
Hudson Valley and then obviously on to

121
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,560
Long Island because those are the warmer

122
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,240
uh spots but then uh we just shifted to

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,879
the last 10 years of the data set uh

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,280
that were generated at the time in the

125
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,439
lower right and you can see by just

126
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,758
comparing them uh significant changes in

127
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,240
the warming of the winters U and the

128
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,639
numbers of days with with these uh

129
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,280
killing temperatures so uh and actually

130
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,639
if you look at Pennsylvania you can see

131
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,318
the really dramatic change so these have

132
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,720
been uh very very strong changes in just

133
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
quite a short time

134
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,199
period um now some of the implications

135
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,120
of that

136
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,639
uh we looked at those uh that was sort

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,560
of an overview this is just Geneva uh

138
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,199
data and in the plot you can see we

139
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:47,280
plotted the coldest temperature each

140
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:50,759
winter um since 1948 or so on up to this

141
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,799
year and uh what you can see is

142
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,199
obviously you're interested in the uh in

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,199
the transit the bottom uh because those

144
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,080
are the uh the ones that really cause

145
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,960
problems for the the industry and so I

146
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:08,719
put a bar on there showing about -1 to

147
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:11,680
-5 or 16 uh fah is the sort of danger

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,919
zone where if you're minus 10 or so

149
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,478
that's into the bud kill uh point above

150
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,318
that you'll lose some buds but it's not

151
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,240
a commercial uh real problem you get

152
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,720
below minus1 then you can really start

153
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,478
having some uh problem with but since we

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
removed most of the buds from great

155
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,839
lines anyway we can tolerate significant

156
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,239
am of Bud kill but then when you start

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,399
getting down to- 15 16 you're looking at

158
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,199
Vine kill so that's sort of your danger

159
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,959
zone and you can see that before 1980 or

160
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,240
so about every four or five years or so

161
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,878
there was a significant kill and uh and

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,879
that was U rather discouraging to

163
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,439
Growers um but since about 1980 until uh

164
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,520
we had a couple of cold years there in

165
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:04,719
04 and 05 uh but since uh during that 22

166
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:07,038
years period or so or 23 year period uh

167
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,520
we didn't have any uh dramatic we have a

168
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,839
little bit of Bud kill but not a

169
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,680
significant winter injury and I think

170
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,799
this really allowed our benifer wine

171
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,439
industry to to develop

172
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,879
dramatically um in 1980 I think we had

173
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,120
around 20 or 22 Wineries and now we have

174
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,080
uh I think it's about 300 now in the

175
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,598
State uh and uh many of them most of

176
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,199
them really have been interested in

177
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,319
growing wine cream so I think the uh

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,278
these winter warming trends that we've

179
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,919
had have been uh really quite positive

180
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:42,519
for uh the grap and wine uh industry in

181
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,159
New York so it's an example of one of

182
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,959
the positives of uh climate change when

183
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:51,000
you're on the cold side you you will see

184
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,799
some positives so um and then of course

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,519
that was the winter we can look at the

186
00:08:52,799 --> 00:09:01,078
length of the growing season a similar U

187
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,240
way of showing this and uh it's um it is

188
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,958
increasing it's not quite as dramatic

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,919
and easy to see but if you look for the

190
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,799
uh the oranges and the Reds uh clearly

191
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,799
you're seeing more of those um in the

192
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:19,199
later um later years and somewhat less

193
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,159
of the uh blues and greens um so the

194
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,440
season has been getting uh getting

195
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,879
somewhat longer

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,079
um as well uh then the warmth of the

197
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:34,120
growing season uh is it really uh uh are

198
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:36,879
the season getting warmer and uh again

199
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,360
comparing the same way uh yes it appears

200
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:43,360
that the that they you're getting more

201
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,639
of the oranges and reds uh coming into

202
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,120
New York uh you can see the warming

203
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,919
going up the Hudson Valley and the

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,278
Finger Lakes are uh are getting warmer

205
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:57,000
again so again quite a bit of evidence

206
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:59,559
that uh that says we're U our growing

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,519
seasons are are getting some long

208
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,759
they're getting somewhat warmer the

209
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,000
winters are getting uh quite a bit

210
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,838
warmer um and these can have have had

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,360
some significant effects we

212
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,760
believe um now one other thing that uh a

213
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,680
lot of times we don't really talk about

214
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,879
as such the CO2 in the in the atmosphere

215
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,399
uh obviously is one of the drivers for

216
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,720
climate change and that it absorbs uh

217
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,639
infrared heat being reradiated from the

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,120
uh uh from the earth and that's why it's

219
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,639
a greenhouse gas um so uh but it also

220
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,919
has Direct effects on on plants and

221
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,319
we'll talk about that in a little bit

222
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,838
but one of the things that's uh that's

223
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,040
very striking uh is the uh is how

224
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:50,279
rapidly the uh carbon dioxide is going

225
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:54,000
up um in the U in the

226
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:57,360
atmosphere um now when I came if you

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,839
follow this uh 320 parts per million

228
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,839
line over right about just above the

229
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,680
printing um it was uh when I arrived

230
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,040
about an INF gas analyzer uh as part of

231
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:13,559
my startup money so I uh started

232
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,559
measuring the CO2 in the air it's 320

233
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,319
parts per

234
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,159
million now it's 380 parts per million

235
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,879
so there been a 60 part per million

236
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:26,519
change in atmospheric CO2 just since

237
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,360
I've been measuring it now the point is

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,240
that the atmosphere is changing rapidly

239
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,240
not that I'm

240
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,240
yeah I mean I I think some might think I

241
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:41,838
should be measured in geologic time but

242
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,959
U but it's a just the uh the rapidity of

243
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,000
the change in the CO2 is is just

244
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,199
astounding and so just a comparison I

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,200
just went back and I circled that uh

246
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,959
that change that occurred over like 35

247
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,800
years uh versus a uh one of the changes

248
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:02,199
during uh uh way back when that it maybe

249
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:06,240
took 50,000 years to have a similar type

250
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,839
of change so um the uh the point is it's

251
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
not only going up and it's higher than

252
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,720
it's ever been but it's going up fast

253
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,518
and uh and it's just not something that

254
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,040
uh that we can ignore uh but it does

255
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,078
have some uh there can be some positive

256
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,679
effects of that as well so um in general

257
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,919
you know we'll see it's a it's going to

258
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,759
be a good news bad news type of story

259
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:36,000
yes do they know drove the CO2 down in

260
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:40,000
that earlier time uh they do I

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,720
don't uh we'll have to ask youan there's

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,879
a lot of there's volcanic activities and

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,600
u a lot of geological stuff going on so

264
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,919
no I I don't really know all the reasons

265
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,879
for

266
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:59,399
that um okay the U also our besides

267
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:02,278
temperatures uh the rainfall has been uh

268
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,919
uh changing somewhat uh it actually

269
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,480
hasn't uh it's been increasing

270
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,559
slightly uh generally the increases when

271
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,440
you have a warming period in a cold area

272
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:14,319
like this um the increases in

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,800
precipitation tend to be in the spring

274
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,480
and in the fall because in March or in

275
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,479
October November when in the past it

276
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,159
might freeze and be you know quite dry

277
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,240
conditions and and some snow uh if it's

278
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,039
warmer and the lakes stay warmer then

279
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,440
you tend to get more uh uh rainfall in

280
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,759
that period um the uh the Summers tend

281
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,399
to not change quite as much but overall

282
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,600
there's a little bit of a trend in U in

283
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,078
precipitation uh being similar or

284
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,800
increasing somewhat uh but the uh the

285
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,000
tendency has been in a couple couple

286
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,519
different things one is that it's tended

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,720
to be more erratic rainfall so heavy

288
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,959
rainfalls a 2in type of of uh rainfalls

289
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,519
occurring and so if you have the same

290
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:06,359
amount of total rain but you're getting

291
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,639
it in fewer major heavy downpours then

292
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,399
you may be expecting to have more drops

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,480
in between um if you're getting the same

294
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,078
amount of rain also if you have a heavy

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,480
downpour a lot of times you get a lot of

296
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:21,000
runoff so the rain may not be as

297
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,079
effective as uh more frequent small

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,480
amounts of rain so that's one thing we

299
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,958
need to uh be aware of for the future is

300
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:33,480
that it's expected to have that Trend

301
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:36,958
continue more and more also snowfall has

302
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,000
declined by AR says as much as 20 inches

303
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,679
in some parts of the state um I know

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,639
around here talking to people that have

305
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,879
lived here all their life they've seen

306
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,440
you know quite dramatic change drop offs

307
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,559
and the am snowfall but in some of the

308
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,680
lake effect areas they've tended to get

309
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:57,758
increase of rainfall because of the lake

310
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:00,198
surface temperatures warming up and

311
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,240
provid providing more heat more humidity

312
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:06,198
for Lake Effect

313
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,600
snows uh so uh there's a lot of things

314
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,120
going on although the totals are really

315
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,440
not changing

316
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,360
dramatically um also we've looked uh it

317
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,639
seemed as though we've been getting more

318
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,600
droughts U and U this is a longterm plot

319
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,360
more of a

320
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:30,560
meteorological um uh estimate of of

321
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:33,278
drought and uh this case anything above

322
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:38,479
the line is a drought anything below the

323
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:41,919
line is is a u um is more of a wet year

324
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,440
and so um there was a period in the

325
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:48,278
1930s uh that one highest peak I think

326
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,759
was 33 and that was an extreme drought

327
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,958
uh and uh you know the Dust Bowl that

328
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,680
sort of thing uh those tended to

329
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,439
correlate with the warmer temperatures

330
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,599
at that time uh that I believe is

331
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,639
related to a high Sol activity at that

332
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,959
time however the solar activity is

333
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,120
really at one of the lows now apparently

334
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:12,159
so um the uh this uh plot only goes

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,759
about 1997 the next over the next 13

336
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,240
years we' we've continued to have

337
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,519
significant droughts and um off and on

338
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,399
but more erratic we've hardly have any

339
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,198
average uh years lately that tended to

340
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,559
be U you know cold and wet orot dry uh

341
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:31,039
so um we uh we do

342
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,719
expect that we're going to have

343
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,078
continued erratic weather so we will

344
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,560
have droughts and we will have floods

345
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:40,039
probably um so that's something that has

346
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,239
been occurring uh actually the anomaly

347
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,639
really is the

348
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,680
1970s there were hardly any droughts at

349
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:50,759
all it was a relatively cool and uh wet

350
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:55,198
wet period uh throughout that whole

351
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:57,159
Whole Decade so um okay so what have

352
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,879
been some of these some of the impacts

353
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:03,159
mentioned a few but I did list that U uh

354
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,640
the premium wine industry which based on

355
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:08,480
the cold tender varieties like Cabernet

356
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,880
and charday uh have really been able to

357
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,160
expand uh greatly a lot of the expansion

358
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,480
has been supported by uh by research on

359
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,919
learning how to uh how to grow The Vines

360
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,720
for better coold tolerance and how to

361
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,959
prune them or wait not prune um but I I

362
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,798
believe a lot of it's been allowed to

363
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,960
occur because of the climate change

364
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,400
um Bloom dates are tending to get

365
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,360
earlier I'll show show you that uh

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,640
giving somewhat longer growing seasons

367
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,038
and our fruit crops are crops that are

368
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,160
able to take advantage of that some

369
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,480
plants you know you plant them and you

370
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,240
know 80 90 days or whatever they they're

371
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,880
done and then if you have a longer

372
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,200
growing season you you really don't take

373
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,320
advantage of it our crops being

374
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,319
perennials come out as soon as they can

375
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:03,519
in the spring and uh they not really uh

376
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,119
uh day length uh controlled so in the

377
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,639
fall if you have a nice long fall they

378
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,719
just keep their leaves and they keep

379
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,600
keep

380
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,279
functioning um and really the places

381
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,079
that have the highest yields are the

382
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,200
ones that have the longest growing

383
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,599
Seasons uh because our apples and grapes

384
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,159
are able to adapt to the length of the

385
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:27,439
growing season uh so that's a real

386
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:30,840
advantage of our to the crops um and uh

387
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,720
also apple trees been looked at dry

388
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,959
matter production and potential yields

389
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,919
um and they really are able to take

390
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,480
advantage of of long growing Seasons

391
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,440
such as New Zealand where they can uh

392
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,440
they can typically produce almost twice

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,400
as much fruit per hectar as we can in

394
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,080
New York and it's not warmer uh so

395
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,960
they're able to do this primarily

396
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:59,359
through uh the extended growing season

397
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,240
um okay so uh know of course some of the

398
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,439
warmer seasons and the uh and the

399
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,359
droughts not only drought but a cool

400
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
drought doesn't have nearly the effect

401
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,399
as a hot drought uh so when you get uh

402
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,400
warmer warmer years and then you get

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,919
droughts on top of it the effect is is

404
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,480
even stronger so we've had more years

405
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,520
was with some drought symptoms occurring

406
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,400
at least in the last 40 to 50 years and

407
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,200
u u and that's the need for irrigation

408
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,798
more grow been putting Irrigation in or

409
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,679
wishing they had irrigation

410
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:36,400
uh and uh but that can be quite good

411
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:39,000
though for red wine varieties kernet

412
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,798
family don't do very well when it's

413
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,400
really moist and humid uh during the

414
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,119
during the whole season so the drought

415
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,080
years are the years that we get really

416
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,558
nice red Cabernet type wines and uh

417
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,960
Justin chin here can talk talk to you

418
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,879
all about some of the reasons for that

419
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,120
so um so there are there's a mixture of

420
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,640
things that that are happening because

421
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,359
of that uh now let's look at some

422
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,640
examples uh here's the date of Apple

423
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:13,119
Bloom uh these are these are from about

424
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,440
19 I think 65 or so up until the present

425
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:19,038
and uh you can see as with any

426
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,360
biological responses are quite variable

427
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,960
because they're responding to the to the

428
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:27,279
climate uh but overall there's been a

429
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:31,000
very significant Trend uh the rate of

430
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:34,839
change has been uh about 8 days in over

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,159
that 40-year period uh or so so it's a a

432
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,918
quite Market increase or earlier Bloom

433
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,919
of

434
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,000
apples U and of course we're expecting

435
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,640
that to uh to

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,599
continue uh this is a plot from fonia

437
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:57,640
where uh a uh uh the conquered Bloom

438
00:20:53,599 --> 00:21:00,319
dates were collected from a uh uh a one

439
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,520
experiment that sha set up pool

440
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,399
continued Terry baits have continued so

441
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:10,158
these are actually data from the same

442
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,640
exact plants for 50 years uh so uh again

443
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,080
you can see the uh the trend is quite

444
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,960
clear not quite as much 5 and a half

445
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,918
days or so over that time period uh and

446
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,798
I think that's because uh grapes Bloom

447
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,759
about a month later than Apples and it's

448
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,119
more more into the summer which hasn't

449
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:32,000
been warming quite as much uh but again

450
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:33,359
still a fairly clear trend for climate

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,759
based

452
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,639
responses uh now I mentioned the CO2

453
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,158
that is a uh not only adds to The

454
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:47,080
Climate the heating issue uh but it's

455
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:50,320
also used by plants and uh um so we have

456
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:53,158
done some studies with our whole canopy

457
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,720
balloon Chambers here where we can CO2

458
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,960
enrich them and we've done some CO2

459
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,079
response curves now these are short

460
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,919
shortterm responses so a lot of uh uh a

461
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:08,359
lot of different plants will show a

462
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,200
similar type of response um many plants

463
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,439
when they're grown at higher CO2 levels

464
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,038
uh downregulate because they're really

465
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,679
not able to utilize that extra carbon

466
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:19,919
and so then they tend to downregulate

467
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,038
the photosynthesis so that they don't

468
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,278
really see a dramatic effect in over

469
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:27,879
long run uh we have not really been able

470
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,679
to do the free air CO2 enrichment

471
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,679
studies need to be done with our fruit

472
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,600
crops but in general uh plants that have

473
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,600
a lot of sinks that can adapt and you

474
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,119
can if you can add sinks to take

475
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,079
advantage of the extra carbon those

476
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,119
plants tend to respond much better to

477
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,199
long-term uh carbon dioxide enrichment

478
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,278
and that's one thing about especially

479
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,558
with apples uh the number of apples are

480
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:56,159
set early in the season and during that

481
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,678
time of the season when they're really

482
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,240
being set and the final crop numbers

483
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,960
being uh established that's the time

484
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,200
when the plant is under carbon deficit

485
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,759
so we've done some uh we've done some

486
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,200
shter term studies with CO2 enrichment

487
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,798
or even injection of sorbitol into the

488
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,519
trees and been able to cause a very

489
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,960
dramatic increase in the Set uh of those

490
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,759
trees so we're expecting that apples

491
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,400
will respond quite uh quite well to the

492
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,480
uh to the extra carbon because the

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,038
carbon is limiting at the time they they

494
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,038
set the sinks and there's lots and lots

495
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:36,319
of extra sinks usually a commercial crop

496
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:38,440
may only uh be 5 to 10% of the flowers

497
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,720
so we've got a lot of extra syn capacity

498
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,240
that we can add so uh so we think that

499
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,159
uh that uh increased yields due to that

500
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,079
increase CO2 may be a very

501
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,559
significant factor and uh uh the the

502
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,960
increase just as I mentioned from 320 to

503
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,519
380 is enough to really increase the

504
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,919
photosynthesis of the tree and from

505
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,278
models would suggest that there should

506
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,880
have been some some increase in uh in

507
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:09,278
Fruit set and yields uh just over the

508
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,120
last 30 40 years due to that of course

509
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,000
we don't have a real experiment to to

510
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,319
prove it but um so I think we these

511
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,519
crops again are are ones that are likely

512
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,918
to respond to the climate and in some

513
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:25,000
ways and some positive ways too so what

514
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,600
about the future what's what's going to

515
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,278
happen uh I don't want to go through all

516
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,158
the change information Dave wolf covered

517
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,798
a lot of that I think maybe art is going

518
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:41,278
to uh to talk also um but for those that

519
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:44,720
didn't hear Dave uh just a few slides to

520
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:48,278
sort of set the uh stage uh there have

521
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,759
been several studies on the uh report of

522
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,599
Northeast climate impact

523
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:58,440
assessments uh and they're available uh

524
00:24:53,599 --> 00:25:00,678
online at climate choices.org um and so

525
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,798
done a lot of work and Dave's been a key

526
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:08,200
contributor to that um and so it's

527
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:11,079
climate ch.org also if you're interested

528
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,080
in grapes uh there was a nice article in

529
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:18,158
the Practical Winery magazine by U uh

530
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:22,599
kill and Fields that gives a good review

531
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,278
and summary of uh of that so um

532
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,759
basically the climate models run have

533
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,558
different scenarios and I I don't want

534
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,879
to go into all those but basically a lot

535
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,519
of the comparisons that the uh that I'll

536
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,520
show here were done with the lower

537
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,879
emission scenario and that's basically

538
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,558
saying that uh that we actually wake up

539
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,200
as a society and we stop cranking all

540
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:48,079
this extra CO2 into the air and we level

541
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,319
it out and maybe eventually bring it

542
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,000
down maybe by the end of the century so

543
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,720
that's that's you know we really behave

544
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,720
well and then the uh the higher one uh

545
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:05,679
in red is if of as usual keep keep going

546
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,000
um and um so on this uh there's been

547
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,159
about we mentioned about two degrees

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,359
warming since 1970 just up until today

549
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,600
about last 40 years uh even with a even

550
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:20,038
with a good lower emissions scenario uh

551
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,119
because of the inertia of uh of

552
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:26,119
something like this massive as our um

553
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,798
oceans and climate uh they still expect

554
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:32,239
to see something around a 4 to six type

555
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:35,440
of increase um so even at least doubling

556
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,880
of what we've already seen recently uh

557
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,720
then of course the higher scenario which

558
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,000
I think is almost being shown to be not

559
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,440
as high as it even should be um is uh

560
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,038
more in the 6 8 10 12 degrees uh which

561
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,159
of course is a huge change in in our

562
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,679
climate uh but they using these to sort

563
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,840
of bracket what we think would be best

564
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,399
in worst case scenarios uh and they use

565
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,678
this Ty of illustration this is from the

566
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:06,319
those Publications I mentioned uh

567
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,159
that're basically saying in yellow U on

568
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,319
the left is Upstate New York and on the

569
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,080
right is the New York City region um if

570
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:18,079
you look at Upstate uh from the you know

571
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:21,519
historical climate in in our position

572
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,558
there uh that by the end of the century

573
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,679
uh with the best case scenario would

574
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:29,000
probably going to be more like Virginia

575
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,200
climate in terms of temperature um

576
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,919
and then of course with the uh business

577
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,720
as usual High emission scenario we'd be

578
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,840
more down into South Carolina Georgia

579
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,319
you know Atlanta kind of uh kind of

580
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,720
conditions uh in 60 to 80 years um and

581
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:51,119
that's that's within some lifetimes here

582
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,919
so it's a uh it's sort of a scary uh

583
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,798
scenario now of course it's very greatly

584
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,840
simplified because the climate won't be

585
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,079
exactly that way but this just gives an

586
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:01,359
idea of the the typ of when you start

587
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,319
talking about those changes and what if

588
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,398
you look to see climates that have those

589
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,119
types of uh climates see where you are

590
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:12,158
so

591
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:16,479
um this is also some data U believe from

592
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:20,200
art um that showing the uh in the

593
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,480
outline in red is the historic area for

594
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,440
uh snowfall and snow cover during the

595
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:32,038
winter um and then in the the white

596
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,240
shows again late 60 80 years from now uh

597
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:37,558
the uh the type of areas that will have

598
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,359
snow cover uh with with their

599
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:44,398
predictions and with the uh temperature

600
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:47,678
patterns um now the exact implications

601
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:50,839
of this uh a little bit hard to say in

602
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,600
some cases uh snowfall and snow cover is

603
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,240
particularly helpful for perennial

604
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:57,678
plants to be able to uh especially for

605
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,599
some of the wine grapes to be able to

606
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,600
cover

607
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,678
base of the plants now we can't depend

608
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,918
on it but if it does cover the plant it

609
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,919
is a very good insulator so U it may

610
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,360
help us uh survive from those few really

611
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,360
cold spells that we do get um but it

612
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,839
looks like we're not going to be able to

613
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,918
depend on that in the uh in the near

614
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,000
future so that's a pretty dramatic uh

615
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,799
change and again that's one of those

616
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,759
sort of Tipping Point things it doesn't

617
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,679
take too many degrees of change to go

618
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:33,038
from uh uh snow to rain

619
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,480
and uh and Chang the U um snow cover

620
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:39,038
there's also been some uh I just saw

621
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,880
today some data on ice on the great

622
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:45,158
lakes and even though you know it still

623
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,120
varies a lot in the last uh um in the

624
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,640
2000s there's been U quite a few years

625
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,959
where there's very very little ice

626
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,320
formed and I I can remember on senica

627
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,558
lake in the 70s it actually uh freezing

628
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:04,000
all the way down dress in and now uh

629
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:05,319
probably the grad students here been

630
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,159
here several years probably have not

631
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,599
seen any ice at all so uh there have

632
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,880
been really dramatic changes in the U in

633
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,079
the lakes also and of course they're

634
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,159
they're very large bodies to to change

635
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:20,119
very much so um again mentioned that

636
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,278
it'll be warmer but there'll also be

637
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:26,398
spikes not only cold spikes but hot

638
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,359
spikes and so U uh New York City is is

639
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,759
the Hest Place basically state so

640
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:36,119
they're very concerned about that and so

641
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,919
um this plot uh that art provided shows

642
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:43,158
the number of days per year uh the main

643
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:47,759
plot over 90 uh degrees and again on the

644
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:50,760
left the 1961 to 90 the long term uh and

645
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,960
then the U the different U lower and

646
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,759
higher uh emission scenarios showing you

647
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,519
know dramatic increases in the numbers

648
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,158
of days over 90 and then the set just

649
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,558
shows that they're expecting days over

650
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,840
100 to maybe go from you know a couple

651
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:09,359
this uh per year to uh maybe late in the

652
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,359
season with the high emission scenarios

653
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,199
up to 25 almost a month of over 100

654
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,079
degree temperatures in New York city

655
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,840
that has some really major implications

656
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,519
for uh for the city and the state uh and

657
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,839
I just looked back and uh and this this

658
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:30,480
summer Central Park had 34 days over 90

659
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:33,678
degrees uh I think there were 17 days in

660
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,599
July that were over 90 degrees um and

661
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,320
that's in Central Park so it's not it's

662
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:42,638
not like at an airport a lot of pavement

663
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:45,158
either so um any Cas so they're we're

664
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:48,079
expecting to see extremes and also

665
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:51,200
obviously extremes out out in the

666
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:54,519
country as well um as I mentioned the

667
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,278
end reation this is a plot uh showing

668
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,120
the types of variation this is something

669
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,440
that's a lot more difficult to predict

670
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,839
because of uh you know predicting clouds

671
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,840
and rainfall is a lot more a lot harder

672
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,480
uh but they uh they did some averages

673
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,158
and and basically they're showing for

674
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,278
this region that there's not going to be

675
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,960
a dramatic change there'll be a gradual

676
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,519
increase I think over that time it look

677
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,880
looks like it's maybe getting up in that

678
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:26,319
you know 10 to 15% at most uh type of U

679
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,840
of increase in yields of of rainfall and

680
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,879
again I think primarily spring and fall

681
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,759
as we get into the warmer Winters and

682
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,360
less snowfall uh then it turns into rain

683
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,519
uh but we're not going to be seeing a

684
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:43,119
lot of reduction in in U rainfall that

685
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,839
some other regions have been seeing uh

686
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,359
so that's that's one of the good news um

687
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,798
but again they they're predicting as we

688
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:54,199
have been seeing greater uh heavy

689
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:57,119
rainfalls and then maybe dry periods in

690
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,720
between okay so uh let's talk about some

691
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,278
of the uh likely impacts I talked about

692
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,200
some and we talk a little bit more and

693
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:09,880
project more into future uh okay some of

694
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,639
the uh main factors would be warmer

695
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,600
Winters what are the implications of

696
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:18,798
that uh more droughts and heavy rain uh

697
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:23,558
longer growing Seasons higher CO2 in the

698
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:26,278
air and uh um and likely with uh with

699
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:28,278
warmer wedes more Pest and disease

700
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,919
pressures and weeds

701
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,798
um because we won't be killing them off

702
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,639
during the winter as much so uh let's

703
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,879
look at U few examples and see what uh

704
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:43,359
what we might be expecting many of them

705
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,960
are extensions of what we have seen uh

706
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,439
but again it might be two or threefold

707
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,159
uh the effect that we've been looking at

708
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,080
uh with the warmer Winters obviously we

709
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,600
may be able to grow warmer uh you know

710
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:58,240
more tender varieties especially in the

711
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,199
the wine grape uh area

712
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,399
uh New York is becoming a very

713
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,480
well-known wine producing area now and

714
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:11,440
uh with the expansion uh there's a a

715
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,838
great future for the uh industry uh and

716
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,519
being able to have a wider range of

717
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,559
grapes that can be grown here uh will be

718
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:23,559
very positive for the industry

719
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,039
um however uh in the shorter term we may

720
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,000
eventually get to the point where we

721
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,039
never have any real winter kill many

722
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,079
places but uh but in the shorter term we

723
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,838
may have this sort of up and down

724
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:39,000
situation we'll have a warmer winter but

725
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,799
because we may have warmer periods

726
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,239
during the winter The Vines May de

727
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,879
acclimate some and so even if it's

728
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,918
warmer we may still get winter injury

729
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,960
not because of the temperature so much

730
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,759
as because of the fact that we've had

731
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,800
deactivating periods and uh we've

732
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:03,040
already seen this uh this just some

733
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:08,119
plots from Nelson excuse me Martin

734
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:12,358
Gan about the uh Bud acclamation for

735
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:14,680
Cabernet resling and conquered um over a

736
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,000
couple different years just showing the

737
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:20,679
the general pattern and as you can see

738
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,559
in the top uh top part part here uh the

739
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:26,000
same general pattern of the uh of the

740
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,159
grapes these would be the uh the

741
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,519
temperature pretty these lt50 or the

742
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:35,239
temperatures of which 50% of the buds

743
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,599
will Kill U and you can see on the top

744
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,679
graph that as you go down through the

745
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,000
season there's some differences in the

746
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,480
uh uh in the varieties uh but if you

747
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,920
notice say compar conquer and and

748
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,159
Cabernet Cabernet on top is quite a bit

749
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,280
slower to get to its maximum hardiness

750
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,358
if you follow down out by January and

751
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,680
February they're really not as different

752
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:01,000
as you might expect but during the early

753
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,719
part of the Season Cabernet is more

754
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
tender uh but yeah it's a little bit

755
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,559
hard to follow the lines but if you

756
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,559
follow them when they come out of this

757
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,000
of the winter and the

758
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,639
spring the uh the conquer comes out more

759
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,440
quickly and the Cabernet is a little bit

760
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,358
slower so um it shows that there's some

761
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,400
different patterns of acclamation

762
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:25,039
acclamation and de acclamation that that

763
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,639
could be uh quite important we need to

764
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,039
understand those uh because if we have C

765
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,440
weather patterns and we can have

766
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,000
varieties that better suit or less

767
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,000
responsive to those warm periods that

768
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,318
may be U uh may be quite helpful U now

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,280
the bottom plot just shows uh the

770
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:44,519
temperatures were going along and then

771
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,560
they really dropped dramatically and

772
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,719
they hit a point where the Cabernet were

773
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,039
killed but they hadn't really

774
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,199
equilibrated yet and so the other

775
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,480
conquerors and recing were able to

776
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:59,000
survive uh now we saw that uh this

777
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,800
example in a couple different years one

778
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,559
that I mentioned was uh

779
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:10,519
2004 uh the U 2004 was the January uh

780
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,920
part of this plot and uh so in the in

781
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,039
the dark blue you can see the uh these

782
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,519
are the daily minimum temperatures and

783
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,960
so they were bouncing along in uh

784
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:25,119
November December or so and in

785
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,960
1994 which was a year that we got almost

786
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,200
you know we were within a degree or two

787
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,159
of the same

788
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:34,480
cold temperature at the very end down in

789
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,838
the bottom um but you could see that uh

790
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,240
in the period before the coldest

791
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,920
temperature the uh the minimum

792
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,479
temperatures really never got above

793
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,039
freezing they were they always cons

794
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,280
fairly consistently cold and so the

795
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,679
vines didn't

796
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,519
deaconate so when when they did have the

797
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,399
minus 13 or

798
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,599
14 uh there was butt kill but it wasn't

799
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,160
a major catastrophe for the uh for

800
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,359
industry but in 2004 the Blue Line you

801
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,920
can see that the period just before the

802
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,358
coldest

803
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,280
temperature uh these are the minimums

804
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,960
and a lot of those days didn't even get

805
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,079
to freezing so we had an abnormally warm

806
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,199
period for a significant amount of time

807
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,640
almost three weeks and then it took

808
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,879
about four days four or five days and it

809
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:25,118
just went through the floor and hit

810
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,160
minus 15 16 depending where you were and

811
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,559
there was massive fine kill and mendous

812
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:34,719
impact on the industry so uh again the

813
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,679
minimum temperatures that at the very

814
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,838
bottom weren't dramatically different

815
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,679
but it was the uh the warming of that

816
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:44,960
period of the period before the cold

817
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:48,039
that really uh got to us in 2004 so

818
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,159
we're expecting that uh until the

819
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,039
climate warms up quite a bit more that

820
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:56,078
there may be some of these years uh in

821
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,119
between where uh uh where we might

822
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,960
actually see Killing even a higher

823
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:04,280
temperature than we normally see uh just

824
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,119
because of these deating periods uh so

825
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,160
that's that's a uh that's a concern for

826
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:12,240
the industry um there's not really a lot

827
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:16,039
you can do about it uh we basically tend

828
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:18,838
to wait uh until as late as possible

829
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,960
into March and April to do the pruning

830
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:24,159
so that you can uh you can uh remove

831
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,960
canes and and cut the buds to look and

832
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,159
see what percentage of them are still

833
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,519
alive and then can adjust the uh the

834
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,679
pruning uh but we typically we do that

835
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,639
pretty much as a normal procedure now so

836
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,719
so that's something that uh that we

837
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:42,118
think is likely to happen before we get

838
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,118
completely out of the winterkill uh type

839
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,519
of climate now of course if you have

840
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,880
milder Winters then some of the uh pests

841
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:54,199
and diseases that are killed back by our

842
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:58,039
Winters uh in grapes pierces disease for

843
00:39:54,199 --> 00:40:01,519
example uh and there's a lot of other

844
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,000
diseases and pests that uh uh that are

845
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,759
to the south of us and they don't

846
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,599
normally make it through their our

847
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:13,000
Winters here uh are likely to um to make

848
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,760
it it will tend to increase our uh

849
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,119
pesticide loads probably uh because

850
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,960
we're going to have to deal with those

851
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,358
additional uh uh bugs the ones that we

852
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,920
have now probably are not going to go

853
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:26,440
away because the winter is somewhat

854
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,838
warmer they may actually maybe survive

855
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,960
even better so that's a real concern

856
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:32,480
about the warmer climate is uh is the

857
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,480
increased

858
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,159
pesticide herbicide load uh this is just

859
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,559
a an example showing Kudzu which we

860
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:45,480
always think of as a real Southern type

861
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:49,599
of plant but excuse me with

862
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,838
u the uh these plots are basically main

863
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,920
point can't go through all the details

864
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:58,239
but uh it's the uh they relate to the

865
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,720
number of days below Celsius that is

866
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:04,439
really sort of a uh completely kills

867
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:06,639
Kudzu and basically the point is that

868
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,480
kudu is going to be able to move north

869
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,639
if our climate continues to warm this

870
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,960
way so uh instead of great mines growing

871
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,759
all over our trees they might be

872
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,280
fighting with the cutu in in the

873
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,599
future so that is a a real real concern

874
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,640
though um now some of the the timing of

875
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,079
the seasons uh you know we mentioned

876
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:32,159
that uh that the grapes and things uh or

877
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,200
the apples are uh blooming earlier u in

878
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,519
general this is not only just for our

879
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,879
crops but for uh for other uh plants in

880
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:43,079
the spring generally will be arriving

881
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,559
know one to two weeks uh earlier if it's

882
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,480
a lower emission scenario and maybe up

883
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:52,199
to three weeks earlier by again 60 years

884
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,880
from now um that uh you know that may be

885
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,719
quite positive for us if we need the

886
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:01,079
longer growing season uh the growing

887
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:04,439
season is expect to uh uh extend longer

888
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,480
because of that um one of the issues

889
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,960
though uh is if we start getting earlier

890
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,639
Bud break are we going to have more

891
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,440
Frost injury because of that earlier Bud

892
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:17,279
break and I'll show you some data there

893
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,400
um and then of course we expect to have

894
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,319
more summer if the we're getting longer

895
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,240
on both ends um okay this issue of uh

896
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:28,318
spring Frost uh we went back and looked

897
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,318
over that same of time that I showed you

898
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:35,440
the Apple uh data for Geneva and we

899
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:38,960
looked for the uh the last 28 de fhe

900
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,159
minus 2 uh Celsius temperatures in the

901
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,280
spring uh because plant tissues uh don't

902
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:48,838
freeze at zero take a couple degrees

903
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,599
below zero to uh to uh freeze the super

904
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:57,358
cooling of the soles um so we uh we did

905
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:59,280
plot uh the uh uh the line above above

906
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,960
the uh that same regression I showed you

907
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,559
from the Apple Bloom and then the

908
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,960
regression down below is for the last 28

909
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:11,720
degree Frost and you can see that uh

910
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,240
that the uh those frosts are getting the

911
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,318
last frost is getting earlier and

912
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,118
earlier in the uh uh in the year as well

913
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,639
and actually the rate of change is

914
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,318
somewhat faster than the rate of change

915
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,799
in the Apple plume uh 11 days over the

916
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,800
40 years versus eight eight or eight and

917
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,480
a half days I think it was

918
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,440
um so uh so it doesn't necessarily um

919
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,920
look like we're we're going to be

920
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,039
expecting more Frost than average I

921
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,639
think one of the one of the difficult or

922
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:46,079
or uh ones to predict is many times the

923
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,480
frosts occur because of uh clear skies

924
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,559
and a radiation Frost well trying to

925
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,280
predict radiation and cloudiness is is

926
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,160
something that's really really difficult

927
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,720
um and so that that one has a huge a bar

928
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,000
and there you know climatologists are

929
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:04,558
saying well I don't don't try to um you

930
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,358
know get anything uh too specific on

931
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,040
that that part but in general it doesn't

932
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,639
it doesn't look like frosts were staying

933
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,838
the same and our crops are getting

934
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,159
earlier uh they seem to be going along

935
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,480
pretty much the

936
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:22,440
same uh okay so then if we have a you

937
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,599
know warmer uh Summers here's a study

938
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,800
saying okay uh for uh growing uh premium

939
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:33,838
wine Gra and these would be in the uh

940
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,640
relatively cool to M to moderate warmth

941
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,239
growing season which is a fairly fairly

942
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,159
simplified way of looking at it uh but

943
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,719
there was a study done where they they

944
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:48,000
looked to uh uh to see what were the

945
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,719
likely changes in uh climates that are

946
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,400
suitable for that uh that type of

947
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:57,919
growing season and uh basically I'm

948
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,358
going into a lot of detail As you move

949
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,440
to the right you can see that uh say on

950
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:06,679
the upper left the areas that are

951
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,079
suitable uh they U they show a lot in

952
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:13,519
California Oregon Washington um and even

953
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,960
in Arizona uh in that area Central

954
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,519
Valley of California it does have a lot

955
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,639
of grapes but they're just saying it's

956
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:23,920
not it's not Optimum for premium quality

957
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:27,039
you know cabern and chard type of uh

958
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,680
condition so uh but in the future

959
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,759
they're they're expecting California to

960
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:36,239
really have very restricted areas that

961
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:39,240
will be uh more of the Napa Valley orino

962
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,358
Sonoma type of conditions uh but in the

963
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,279
upper right hand corner you can see that

964
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,719
they're really expecting the Northeast

965
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,319
to be one area that is uh benefited by

966
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,959
uh the growing season now again it is a

967
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:53,599
very simplified approach which um I

968
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,440
don't want to be too much into it but it

969
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,559
does it does suggest that uh that you

970
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,200
know we to benefit where other other

971
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:03,800
places are going to be excessively

972
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,318
hot

973
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:10,400
um now besides just looking at the

974
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:12,239
general Trends and uh and doing some uh

975
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,160
uh qualitative estimates of what might

976
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:19,399
be going on uh we did try to use our uh

977
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:22,399
carbon balance models um that we've been

978
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,720
uh developing at one for grape and apple

979
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,400
and this is a simulation that we did

980
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:32,159
with our VM grape model where we looked

981
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,760
at uh this is the simulated daily CO2

982
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,399
fixation uh or daily and daily

983
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,599
respiration uh

984
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,800
pervine and uh with the uh with the

985
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:47,039
heavy and the black line uh the black

986
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,800
lines you can see is the uh the top the

987
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,679
top lines are the photosynthesis and the

988
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,839
lower ones are the

989
00:46:50,679 --> 00:47:01,078
respiration um and the uh black wine is

990
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:04,400
is taking a an average of a current year

991
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,640
that was a a quite average year and I

992
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,920
put together we pulled some months out

993
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:13,318
from different years that uh that had an

994
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,358
average average average mean temperature

995
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:19,719
but we wanted to keep that variation not

996
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:22,440
just using a flat uh mean so uh so that

997
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:26,399
is sort of our current situation and

998
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,000
then uh and then we added 5° C to see

999
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,160
what would happen Happ with a 5° warming

1000
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,880
of the average but we kept that same

1001
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:39,039
variation so uh uh you can see several

1002
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,119
things one is uh obviously you uh as we

1003
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,519
got warmer we didn't necessarily see any

1004
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,480
higher maximum photosynthesis of the uh

1005
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:50,759
of the plants uh because we're in our

1006
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,880
summers pretty close to Optimum as it is

1007
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,480
uh where you did see a difference is

1008
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,599
that because we had a warmer growing

1009
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,800
season the trees get started earlier and

1010
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,720
so you end up with a longer growing

1011
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,519
season so the uh the red line is shifted

1012
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:07,639
off to the right the later part of the

1013
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,440
growing season and so you can pick up

1014
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,400
extra dry matter of production there uh

1015
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,920
but of course the warmer conditions lead

1016
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,240
to more

1017
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,680
respiration and as you can see on the

1018
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:23,039
red lines um there are more days that

1019
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,279
have really uh suboptimal photosynthesis

1020
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,719
and these would be the heat spikes that

1021
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,280
we' be expecting to

1022
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:33,558
so we're using the simulation models to

1023
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,200
try to uh to look at some of these and

1024
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,400
so this is just sort of a summary then

1025
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,239
on the top showing that between those

1026
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,960
two seasons we suggested that there're

1027
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,118
added up to about a 20% increase in the

1028
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,880
total

1029
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,039
photosynthesis uh about a 35% increase

1030
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,760
in the

1031
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:54,440
respiration and because of the

1032
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,119
respiration flower so uh when you take

1033
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,480
the difference we got about 10 to 12 %

1034
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,160
or so increase in accumulated dry matter

1035
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,440
by having that extra 5° so it's some

1036
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:09,838
positive effect but it's not a dramatic

1037
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:14,159
effect um the

1038
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:16,239
U uh so the summary then would be um

1039
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,399
that with that warmer year we reach

1040
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,838
those temperatures for Bud break about

1041
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,480
two weeks earlier than normal and end up

1042
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:26,719
with a 4 to5 week longer

1043
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:29,159
season uh there will be some more phot

1044
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,759
synthis but because of the increased

1045
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:36,159
respiration the net effect isn't as

1046
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:39,520
great uh the real uh real concern so are

1047
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:42,798
um possibly not averages but those those

1048
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:46,199
spikes those heat spikes that uh uh may

1049
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:48,280
be very detrimental to fruit quality and

1050
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,318
they're seeing a lot of this a lot more

1051
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,960
in places like Australia where where

1052
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,838
they're getting heat spikes and it's

1053
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,039
really causing U some problems with

1054
00:49:53,838 --> 00:50:01,480
quality not necessarily yield uh um so

1055
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:04,079
overall there's probably a net positive

1056
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:08,079
there may be some episodes that may be

1057
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:11,559
maybe um a

1058
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,920
concern okay um so what uh what about

1059
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,000
the situation with you know more more

1060
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,200
heavy rains and maybe droughts in

1061
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,280
between okay that suggests that we

1062
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:25,318
probably need uh sites that will have

1063
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,240
both excellent drainage and good water

1064
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:28,599
supply well

1065
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:30,078
you know if you go to a really well-

1066
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,960
drained site a lot of times you're short

1067
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,798
of water and if you have a site that

1068
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,720
holds a lot of water you can get a lot

1069
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:39,719
of heavy rains you may be in trouble so

1070
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:42,279
uh we definitely will'll need very good

1071
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:46,039
erosion control so we'll probably have

1072
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,480
to use cover crops uh to uh to be able

1073
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:51,000
to stabilize the soil and those will

1074
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,159
tend to use water also in between time

1075
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,318
so um maybe the best sites especially

1076
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:59,440
for grapes will be uh sites will be you

1077
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:01,920
know very highly drained But be sure to

1078
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,920
have irrigation a drip irrigation system

1079
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,880
with it um and in many ways that

1080
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,599
actually is a simulation of some of the

1081
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,798
some of the very best Vineyards in the

1082
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,838
world that produce the best quality

1083
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:15,920
extremely well drain but then they they

1084
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,679
actually naturally have Deep Roots they

1085
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:23,519
have a supply of water and so maybe we

1086
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:25,239
have to artificially um use that

1087
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,559
approach

1088
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:30,439
um okay some of the other things though

1089
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,839
is that uh with more ertic

1090
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,159
precipitation uh you also get more more

1091
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:37,400
erratic rainfall because if you have

1092
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:39,798
droughts typically you've got more sunny

1093
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,599
conditions because the air is dry and

1094
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:46,199
when it's wet you've got to have clouds

1095
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:48,440
to to that precipitation so uh many

1096
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,879
crops don't particularly respond that

1097
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,559
much to say a three or 4 day period it

1098
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,880
might have a heavy rain well uh grapes

1099
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,880
and apples really can respond quite

1100
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,240
strongly short periods uh episodes and

1101
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,559
those sorts of things here's an example

1102
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:08,118
just like a heat Spike uh where we can

1103
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,680
look back in our own current uh uh data

1104
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:13,240
and this is a uh was just showing in

1105
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:16,078
Geneva the temperatures and this is

1106
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:18,798
right in that critical period uh for

1107
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,359
Apple set and right at the end of May

1108
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:23,679
early June and we had um it's a little

1109
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:26,798
bit difficult to see but there were

1110
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:31,078
actually about five days of you know

1111
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:34,599
above 80 or so U and very warm nights in

1112
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:37,680
the mid 60s or so just that type of uh

1113
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:41,079
four or five day heat Spike can cause

1114
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:43,239
significant reduction in Fruit set

1115
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,839
especially if the C if the a grower is

1116
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:47,000
applying a chemical thinner right at

1117
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:51,000
that time you can have some dramatic

1118
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,559
loss of fruit uh I was in uguay recently

1119
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,838
and uh about a year ago they uh they had

1120
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:59,640
a very heavy set uh apples and just

1121
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,199
before they were going to fin they had

1122
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,000
four cloudy days didn't rain all that

1123
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,118
much but it was just four really cloudy

1124
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,079
days and they had a massive drop of

1125
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,920
fruit uh just a tremendous drop and uh

1126
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,000
uh it caused not only problems for the

1127
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,798
Growers and not having the crop they

1128
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,798
needed but also that all that thinning

1129
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:22,119
was done by hand and so it threw a

1130
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:23,719
tremendous number of people out of work

1131
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,760
uh so there are a lot of social

1132
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:28,959
sociological issues that came up because

1133
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,720
of that that one 4 day cloudy period And

1134
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,318
The Growers didn't even notice you it's

1135
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,078
not something you think about normally

1136
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:37,519
so that's something that is uh when you

1137
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:39,839
get more erratic weather more episodes

1138
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,079
this could be a real issue for us and

1139
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,358
yet climatic the climate modelers say we

1140
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:49,359
can't predict that type of thing it's

1141
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:52,039
just too difficult so um okay CO2 in the

1142
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,798
air uh it's used for photosynthesis so

1143
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,279
there should be increased possibility

1144
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:59,000
for uh for dry matter uh yield

1145
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,720
especially in our crops that can take

1146
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,400
advantage of that may help with water

1147
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:07,838
use efficiency lot of times the states

1148
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,519
close somewhat uh due to the CO2 even

1149
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,679
though you're getting more

1150
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:13,280
photosynthesis you may be getting less

1151
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:16,399
or not much more increase in the and

1152
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:20,798
water U loss so water use efficiency may

1153
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:23,280
be improved um and the effects on Apple

1154
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:25,880
uh quality and wine quality is really

1155
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,040
not very clear uh there was one study

1156
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,440
with

1157
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,798
and they found more yield of a similar

1158
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,000
quality so uh they didn't really see too

1159
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:36,719
much effect but they didn't really go

1160
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,920
into a didn't get into the flavor

1161
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,838
profiles either so that's a big big

1162
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,318
question mark for the grape side uh and

1163
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,960
there has been work done

1164
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:50,079
Lisa U has done a lot of work where he

1165
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,000
had CO2 enrichment plots and he found

1166
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:57,839
that weeds seem to respond much better

1167
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,599
to uh CO2 than uh than crops in many

1168
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,759
cases so they found that uh that the

1169
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,760
weed weed pressure dramatically

1170
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:09,079
increased with with high CO2 and again

1171
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:13,440
this this may lead to higher u u

1172
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:15,960
herbicide loads and concerns that way

1173
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,639
um so what what are some of the things

1174
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,240
that we can try to do to adapt to it uh

1175
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:24,798
uh you know adapting to this unavoidable

1176
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,838
change uh it's going to require a lot of

1177
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:31,239
flexibility uh we uh some of the key

1178
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:34,519
issues are we need to understand uh how

1179
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:36,759
soil variability May interact with this

1180
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:40,159
with the uh climate variability I

1181
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,319
mentioned about the water cops and heavy

1182
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:46,000
rainfall I need to understand what the

1183
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:48,719
CO2 is likely to mean U and that really

1184
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,199
needs long-term CO2 enrichment studies

1185
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:54,239
which are very expensive and and uh have

1186
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:57,159
become once they were done with the

1187
00:55:54,239 --> 00:56:00,159
primary grain crops then it became not

1188
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:03,838
fashionable anymore so it's been uh

1189
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:06,838
there is one free air CO2 enrichment uh

1190
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,798
project going on in geisenheim Germany

1191
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:11,239
is starting now they'll have grapes and

1192
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,159
some apples I believe in there also so

1193
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,959
it'll be good to see

1194
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:17,879
that and then we need to uh think more

1195
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,760
about and study a little more about the

1196
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:23,960
winter hardiness responses of these

1197
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,760
different um um wine cultivars and maybe

1198
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,240
maybe even if we could grow some of them

1199
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,039
they may have a a response that's not

1200
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:33,719
exactly what we need

1201
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:36,640
um okay some of the adapt we can shift

1202
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:40,000
to better adapted varieties of course

1203
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:43,358
that's U um you know that that's a

1204
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,960
fairly obvious one um the Breeders

1205
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:48,038
ultimately tell us that well we can

1206
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,400
solve everything so we'll uh you know

1207
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,440
we'll just breed better varieties but

1208
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,639
especially in the wine grape area people

1209
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,639
want Cabernet they don't want Geneva

1210
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,960
selection 43

1211
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,759
uh as such you know so it's a lot harder

1212
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,039
when and uh when you have named known

1213
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:09,160
varieties to uh to change that U uh

1214
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,880
genotype blend other other plants that

1215
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:13,239
people don't care about the variety can

1216
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,920
change much more quickly uh so we need

1217
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:20,719
to be U looking also at maybe sites that

1218
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,920
are going to limit the uh or reduce the

1219
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:26,358
effects of the bad uh the bad components

1220
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,599
and then we may need to try to adap

1221
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:30,679
management since we're not changing

1222
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:34,119
genotypes but we do a lot of crop

1223
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:37,558
management with these crops uh so here

1224
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:39,640
uh uh I think probably most of you were

1225
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,798
here for Greg Jones's talk and he gave

1226
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,199
this uh plot showing uh the average

1227
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,798
growing season

1228
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:51,480
temperatures um and where the different

1229
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:54,079
varieties seem to fit uh the uh the line

1230
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:57,079
the dash line on the left is where

1231
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,480
Geneva is currently finger legs pretty

1232
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:02,680
much and you can see that it goes pretty

1233
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,559
much right through greasing P Noir and

1234
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:08,759
Chard is pretty good and we're a little

1235
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,960
bit little bit cool for S blancon and

1236
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,920
Cat Fran is right at the right at the

1237
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,000
edge and then uh as you go down they're

1238
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,798
really not very feasible to grow some of

1239
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,318
these other um varieties now I put the

1240
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:26,280
second line to the right two degree

1241
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:27,960
change and um you can see that that's a

1242
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,039
that's a pretty significant change in

1243
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,400
the potential varieties and a four

1244
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,680
degree change is going to push even

1245
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,358
further so um these uh the level of

1246
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,879
change that we're talking about is

1247
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,239
enough to really uh really make us want

1248
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,440
to be looking uh in the future that's

1249
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,479
not something we have to do right away

1250
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,400
which is good we have a little time but

1251
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,000
uh but it will be uh you know we will

1252
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,639
have an opportunity to grow uh some of

1253
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,519
the things that uh that we can't now

1254
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:00,199
however we may be out of the region

1255
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:02,159
that's Optimum for the things that we do

1256
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:04,679
well like recently you know signature

1257
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,719
varieties uh burgundy is almost getting

1258
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:10,480
too warm for its own Signature variety

1259
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:12,639
of un form so um so that's a that's a

1260
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,079
concern for the future the other thing

1261
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,358
is that any one location if you have

1262
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:19,640
topography you can you know not all

1263
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,038
sides of a hill have the same

1264
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,440
environment so this is in Germany where

1265
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,599
they've uh they've planted a very very

1266
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:31,200
steep south facing vard

1267
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:33,440
to uh to uh change the sun angle so that

1268
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:38,159
it would be more equivalent to like in

1269
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:40,440
say Burgundy France and um so this is

1270
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:43,038
one one approach they've actually been

1271
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:46,720
finding that it has um it's been getting

1272
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:49,720
too warm and so it's almost not Optimum

1273
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:52,318
anymore so one of the things that we may

1274
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,000
do is here we're on the cool side we

1275
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:57,440
we're pushing things on to you know

1276
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,199
better better exposures uh maybe in the

1277
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,559
future uh from that red line we might be

1278
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,960
wanting to go from the from the south

1279
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:08,319
side with these varieties and maybe on

1280
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,318
recing Bring It Around to the north side

1281
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:14,679
and as ski slopes are on North facing

1282
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:16,880
slopes for a good reason uh and and so

1283
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:19,159
you know we may be able to uh actually

1284
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,400
just go around the hill and try to get

1285
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:23,358
away from some of the uh some of the

1286
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,358
warming that way so that may be one

1287
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:29,598
adaptation so and then of practices we

1288
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,000
do a lot of different things uh maybe

1289
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,318
changing the the floor management as

1290
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,119
mentioned the rainfall but also drought

1291
01:00:35,318 --> 01:00:40,079
uh you know putting in

1292
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,960
irrigation uh in GPS we do a lot of work

1293
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,839
but uh now if it's cool we're trying to

1294
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,720
remove leaves to get the fruit into the

1295
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:49,558
Sun and warm it up in warm places

1296
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:52,919
they're happy to leave the leaves over

1297
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:54,920
top of the fruit to shade them so uh we

1298
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,680
are manipulating the climate within the

1299
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,880
plant and that gives us some possibility

1300
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:04,919
of of again manipulating it in a way to

1301
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,920
counteract uh the detrimental effects so

1302
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:11,200
um okay we're I'm sure got a little bit

1303
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,200
long here but U just some uh some

1304
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:17,038
closing thoughts on you know future and

1305
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,798
what research things um one is that we

1306
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,720
certainly need to get a better

1307
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,880
understanding of crop responses to the

1308
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,919
environment uh there has been a lot of

1309
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,200
work over the years

1310
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,599
but many cases it hasn't been the

1311
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,519
interactions between the uh components

1312
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,798
of the environment that we're seeing

1313
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:36,079
changing um and of course whenever

1314
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:38,960
you're trying to look into the future

1315
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,559
you can't do that with experiments uh

1316
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,039
very well so we have to uh use models

1317
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:45,559
more to understand how the plants work

1318
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,440
and then how they're likely to respond

1319
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:50,680
to those changes uh and so I think

1320
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,920
models that have gotten the bad bad

1321
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:57,239
reputation over the years I think we're

1322
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,639
going to have to uh uh you use them more

1323
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,719
and also understand what their

1324
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:03,118
limitations are uh but there's um if you

1325
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:07,239
look to the Future there's not a lot of

1326
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:09,559
choices without uh using the models um

1327
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:12,399
and then also there's there's a lot more

1328
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,880
outside influences there be carbon you

1329
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:18,000
know uh carbon credits and things like

1330
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,000
that uh that U you know may be positive

1331
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,440
or negative depending on the carbon

1332
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,119
footprint we need to understand how

1333
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,559
those things will impact our Growers as

1334
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,358
well as just the plant

1335
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,798
environment uh and then I think there's

1336
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:34,759
a lot of new technologies out and new

1337
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:37,639
new ways of looking at things that U uh

1338
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:40,960
that the Growers are having to be a lot

1339
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:43,358
more aware of and issues of the consumer

1340
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,798
consumer is looking for things there's a

1341
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:50,078
lot more things about carbon reduction

1342
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:53,358
labeling and those sorts of things so um

1343
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,278
these will have big impacts so um so I'd

1344
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,400
like to thank you for your attention and

1345
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:02,480
it's a bit late but I'd be happy to

1346
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:04,680
answer any questions if you have them uh

1347
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,119
question is you have a table for apple

1348
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,960
variety similar to that um not well I

1349
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:12,160
haven't actually put it together I guess

1350
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:16,000
you know sort of in our head we sort of

1351
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:19,199
know certainly Macintosh is a very cool

1352
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,838
uh seasoned apple variety it doesn't do

1353
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,798
well even in the lower Hudson Valley so

1354
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,519
much and certainly not down south of us

1355
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,239
so um

1356
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:31,679
so U yeah we sort of have the concept

1357
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,318
but I haven't seen anyone actually put

1358
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,318
that into a

1359
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:41,559
table other

1360
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:41,558
questions if

1361
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:56,400
okay when Greg Jones was here uh he

1362
01:03:53,119 --> 01:04:00,000
talked about uh in grapes at least

1363
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:02,680
the um bug break was earlier but there

1364
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,358
was also a compression of the the stages

1365
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:06,239
so that uh a more rapid development

1366
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,838
moving through the different

1367
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,358
phenological stages and if I understood

1368
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:14,558
him right it wasn't actually extending

1369
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:17,880
the season for ripening in the grapes

1370
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,119
because um the maturation went more

1371
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,440
quickly at the high temperatures do you

1372
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,079
see anything like that in apples where

1373
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,960
instead of getting the longer season

1374
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:26,440
that you predict is possible because of

1375
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,400
frost days

1376
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,679
just more rapid maturation brings you

1377
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,278
know the Apple crop needs to be

1378
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:38,598
harvested

1379
01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:42,639
earlier yeah actually U it's the the

1380
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:46,440
stages of development tend tend to be uh

1381
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:48,480
all pushed somewhat forward you know the

1382
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,639
I think there's several several aspects

1383
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,000
one is that uh if you're in the spring

1384
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:56,239
so Bud break to bloom something like

1385
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,400
that uh that tends to be driven by

1386
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:01,278
degree days because they're in a fairly

1387
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,838
cool Time of the Season so that will

1388
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:07,559
tend to be compressed if you have a

1389
01:05:02,838 --> 01:05:10,679
warmer warmer period except uh by by

1390
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:12,319
moving earlier in the season the uh

1391
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:13,719
you're always starting about the same

1392
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,400
temperature because that's when the tree

1393
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:19,679
senses it's the right temperature to

1394
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:22,240
begin to grow so unless unless you start

1395
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,919
earlier and have a more rapid warm up if

1396
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:27,399
the warmup rate is the same then you

1397
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,559
would uh uh you wouldn't expect to see

1398
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:32,039
that that period shorten very much and

1399
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,359
so I haven't seen a lot of evidence

1400
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:36,680
saying that the uh that the period from

1401
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:39,318
say Bud break to bloom is is going to

1402
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:42,598
get dramatically shorter uh that tends

1403
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:45,119
to be uh tends to be more of a Mari time

1404
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,640
will be a longer period because it's a

1405
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,960
slower warmup and a continental climate

1406
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:54,318
will tend to be a u more raped one

1407
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,599
because it it heats up very quickly um

1408
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,920
but for us I I don't I don't necessarily

1409
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:02,640
expect to see the difference in that

1410
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,039
period uh to be that much different just

1411
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:08,920
everything is shifted

1412
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:12,440
forward uh the uh the period from with

1413
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:14,278
apple there tends to be a the model that

1414
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,278
was developed

1415
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:21,440
L you know here in at Cornell uh found

1416
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:23,599
that the uh the temperatures after bloom

1417
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,798
during the cell division period tend to

1418
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:29,200
set the number of days to Har

1419
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,679
and uh so the middle of the season the

1420
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:36,118
degree days don't always don't control

1421
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:37,798
uh growth very well uh because a lot of

1422
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,000
times you know you're right at sort of a

1423
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,679
maximum of response and so a few Degree

1424
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,519
Days one way another doesn't doesn't

1425
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:48,798
affect things too much um so I think

1426
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:52,000
generally we expect to see Bud break

1427
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,480
earlier Blom earlier not dramatically

1428
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,278
different Harvest somewhat earlier but

1429
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:00,278
so I think from Harvest I don't really

1430
01:06:57,278 --> 01:07:02,039
think we're seeing very much uh change

1431
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:05,000
in that period except everything is

1432
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:06,960
shifted forward in case of apples but

1433
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,639
one of the limitations of our climate

1434
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,278
for our fruit crops is the post Harvest

1435
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:14,920
period because some years we've actually

1436
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:17,358
harvested fruit with snow on them but

1437
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,559
there's almost no time at all for the

1438
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:24,159
vines to recover for buds or or or

1439
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:26,640
apples to recover just to uh uh develop

1440
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:30,278
additional Reserves get additional root

1441
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:32,558
growth after harvest um so I think I

1442
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,480
think that post Harvest period is where

1443
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,559
you're going to see the biggest effect

1444
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,760
of the climate change and that's a

1445
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,680
period that allows the vines and the

1446
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:45,039
trees to recover from the crop and it

1447
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:50,000
seems to be able to help the crop set

1448
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:53,799
more fruit the next year um so uh you

1449
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
know I I guess I'm I'm still not sure

1450
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:58,400
whether we're seeing that of

1451
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,239
compression um with the types of changes

1452
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:06,680
that we've seen um is there any evidence

1453
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:09,759
for heat stress in vines or apples that

1454
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:15,198
cils growth in the middle of the season

1455
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:18,359
when you get these days above 9 or

1456
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:21,158
Etc yes um I mean we have seen some

1457
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:23,039
cases where we have seen actually uh

1458
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:26,358
sort of bleaching of the leaves and we

1459
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:28,838
had a very hot spell

1460
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:33,199
and the photosynthesis rate was reduced

1461
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:35,519
by uh fairly significant about 20 or 30%

1462
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:39,960
and that tended to stay there wasn't a

1463
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:42,400
recovery to that uh so uh sometimes and

1464
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,000
I know in areas of Central Valley of

1465
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:47,960
California you get real heat spells the

1466
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,759
vine basically shuts down and really

1467
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,079
doesn't uh really doesn't uh produce

1468
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,838
very much and you'll get delayed

1469
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:58,479
ripening because of that so uh yeah I

1470
01:08:54,838 --> 01:09:00,079
think uh there's there's a few studies

1471
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,439
that have been looking trying to

1472
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,119
document that a little bit more but

1473
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:06,198
there's been a lot of observations by

1474
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:09,039
Growers and uh over the years that those

1475
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:10,919
heat spells uh not only cause a problem

1476
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,679
right at that time but they can cause

1477
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,759
problems in terms of longer term

1478
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:19,798
problems of of hurting the leaf function

1479
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:22,560
so U yeah there can be some uh clear

1480
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:24,560
effects of those those heat spells this

1481
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:29,839
has been a production of Cornell
