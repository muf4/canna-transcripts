1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,108
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:08,660
University so the title of my sort of

3
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:10,669
overview takia saw health pioneers in

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,138
emerging frontiers I've already

5
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:17,899
introduced myself there's more about my

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:21,070
bio in the the handout you've got so I

7
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,629
will without further ado proceed on

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,490
what's been exciting to me as someone

9
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,858
who's been working on this at Cornell

10
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,149
since about 20 years ago is when Cornell

11
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,780
first started working in the area of

12
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:35,929
soil health and he is it's just a great

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,579
merging of an era in the science and

14
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:40,399
particularly soil biology and soil

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,899
ecology of major discoveries with our

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,399
old petri dish techniques we really

17
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,289
hardly knew what was going on with terms

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,759
of microbial community in that soil

19
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,519
though with molecular biology learning

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,109
much more just amazing diversity and

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,609
abundance and learning that almost all

22
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:54,229
of those things are very beneficial for

23
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:57,500
farming and learning how to manipulate

24
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,000
them and some of those I talked about in

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,969
my book that came out about 15 years ago

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,829
called tales from the underground but

27
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,659
what this blended with was at the same

28
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,849
time that we were having these amazing

29
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,789
discoveries about learning more about

30
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,069
the life underground the farmers were

31
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,740
becoming worldwide and in new york in

32
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:17,689
particular farmers becoming aware that

33
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,579
while we've had continued productivity

34
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,709
even in increased productivity over the

35
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,390
past century in a lot of cases this is

36
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:25,669
coming at the expense of our soils

37
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,530
gradually degrading particularly losing

38
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,600
organic matter so a lot of farmer

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,150
motivation to do something to rebuild

40
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,879
our Dannic matter make their souls more

41
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,680
productive more resilient and this also

42
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,658
blended with also new information we

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,710
never had before about the biology and

44
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,240
then we're we're learning today about

45
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:43,929
soil health human health in the

46
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,908
environment all those links that farmer

47
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,830
aspect was really captured in book by my

48
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,100
colleague Harold Vanessa can't be here

49
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,349
today

50
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,149
building stories souls for better crops

51
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:54,589
kind of really a how-to for farmers may

52
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,478
the farmers been very familiar with this

53
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,310
and cooperative extensions been through

54
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,929
numerous additions Harold wrote that

55
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,359
with Fred McGraw from University of

56
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,799
Vermont they finally we have our most

57
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,609
recent book here I've got on the list

58
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,020
the one we're gonna hear about this

59
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:07,280
afternoon from David Montgomery at

60
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:09,560
University of Washington growing a

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,818
revolution and in that book he's there's

62
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,990
a lot of things but one thing that I

63
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,879
like he's that I'm very

64
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,770
why we wanted him today for this talk

65
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,900
really does a great job of capturing the

66
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,000
the history the worldwide movement

67
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,370
happening and farming and how we really

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,319
are on the cusp of a major revolution in

69
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,129
in farming and puts it in that

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,969
perspective

71
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,949
so that's fascinating stuff one of the

72
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,599
things that we know today that we had no

73
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:34,129
idea about when I was in grad school to

74
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,469
the age myself but it really wasn't that

75
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,719
long ago when I went to grad school that

76
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:40,189
was plants and what their roots do is

77
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,109
take up water and nutrients for the

78
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:44,419
plants and inker the plant in the soil

79
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,950
we know now that what's probably as

80
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,009
equally an important thing of what

81
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:52,310
plants do is what their roots exude into

82
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,840
the soil they reduce they release a fair

83
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,000
amount of the sugars from photosynthesis

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
which attracts bacteria to them it helps

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,599
them those bacteria can help them mine

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,700
the soil around them for nutrients they

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,409
exude trace amounts of chemicals that

88
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:08,899
inhibit weeds insects and disease

89
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,599
attract all kinds of beneficial microbes

90
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,550
to them and also can release substances

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,229
that literally dissolve nutrients in the

92
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,850
soil the other ones couldn't acquire and

93
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,889
the other thing that we really

94
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,180
appreciate more is how roots towards

95
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,159
their way through the soil and

96
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,930
particularly with compacted soils some

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,400
of them are able to do this help break

98
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,620
up compaction in a more natural way

99
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,539
instead of tillage and also this creates

100
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,909
pathways water oxygen for other roots

101
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,169
perhaps cash crops to follow and of

102
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,579
course they're all sequestering these

103
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,319
roots are sequestering carbon deep in

104
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,030
the profile which otherwise would be in

105
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,250
the air is the greenhouse gas carbon

106
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,830
dioxide so without going to a lot of

107
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,750
details about all this kind of research

108
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,020
a lot of this is going into our thinking

109
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,509
about rotation crops today and fall

110
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,100
winter cover crops learning not just the

111
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,419
amount of biomass they produce which of

112
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,340
course is important getting organic

113
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,079
matter back into the soil crucial to

114
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,700
soil health but these other things they

115
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,580
might do for particular problems

116
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,589
one example is Sudan grass which will be

117
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,290
familiar to many of you our farmers are

118
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,180
working with farmers in the room the

119
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:10,459
Sudan grass is now known to release a

120
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,530
compound called sergo Lyon which can

121
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,030
suppress weeds and also pathogenic

122
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,770
nematodes so if you got that kind of

123
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,839
problem this is a good prescriptive

124
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,000
rotation crop but you've got compacted

125
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,199
soils this is a good one to try it's its

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,060
roots are very capable of getting into

127
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,879
compacted soils now of course also it's

128
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,750
pumping organic matter deep into the

129
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,100
soil and as I say that these these

130
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,319
plants and these substances are

131
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,629
releasing are not only important in

132
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,209
their own lifecycle but can be very

133
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,399
valuable to a subsequent crop to follow

134
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,989
so that's this plant legacy of that but

135
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,829
all of this work is going into what's

136
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,939
happening with cover crop research today

137
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,349
another big thing about cover crops and

138
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,540
this is where really farmers I think

139
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,100
take the lead and often eat us as much

140
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,910
as we leave them Forrester

141
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,680
is um how to you know so even if we

142
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,960
accept and understand that for example

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,600
using all winter crops in the ground

144
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,129
covered increases they have all kind of

145
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,410
benefits trying to integrate that into

146
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,600
our cash cropping systems and a short

147
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,100
growing season is very difficult and so

148
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,629
many farmers are really leading the way

149
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,230
and this is showing a picture of some

150
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:15,480
interceding of a corn crop these

151
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,009
techniques for really integrating this

152
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,050
into our cropping system so a lot of

153
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,589
exciting stuff going on today and we'll

154
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,270
hear more about that today so I talked

155
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,129
about new stuff new discoveries about

156
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,439
what roots do and of course then there's

157
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,490
the whole thing all this soil biota and

158
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,160
all these things we're learning about

159
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,680
them so in addition to roots possibly

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,110
some species releasing substances that

161
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,430
control weeds pests and disease certain

162
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,530
microbes can help us in that way

163
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,370
basically biological control underground

164
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,569
that top picture a cute little picture

165
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,360
of the mouth part of an immature a

166
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,889
little microscopic worm that's under

167
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,930
than many different species in this well

168
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,418
a couple of them are parasitic to plants

169
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,579
but hundreds of these species are in

170
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,959
almost any handful of soil and many of

171
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,430
them beneficial this is a bacterial

172
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,739
feeder the mouth part of a bacterial

173
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,750
finger these microbes of course are very

174
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,160
important in nitrogen cycling and

175
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,930
essential to all life on the planet

176
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,490
actually played an important role in

177
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,019
making all kinds of essential nutrients

178
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,030
for plants and for humans actually

179
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,399
available so they play important roles

180
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,750
and that the nitrogen fixation that

181
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,149
something many people are familiar with

182
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,040
legume crops would I have a picture

183
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,519
there below the that memo toad is

184
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,860
showing some tiny Rhizobium bacteria

185
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,129
nitrogen-fixing bacteria are latching on

186
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,020
to the soybean root a root hair of a

187
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,240
soybean plant leg implant those will

188
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,189
invade the root welcomed by the plants

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,660
because they will capture nitrogen from

190
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,189
the air spaces in the soil in exchange

191
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,590
for forests and baits and we're

192
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,469
more about how to maximize these sorts

193
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,929
of symbiosis all of these creatures that

194
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,120
are in the soil and the large abundance

195
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,500
of them release sticky substances and of

196
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,079
course the fungi that are in the soil

197
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,000
released those five high feed that

198
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,599
helped hold the soil together and this

199
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,819
leads to good soil aggregation which is

200
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,980
amazingly just critical to water holding

201
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,329
capacity and good drainage and swell if

202
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,550
there's no if there's the soil is

203
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:10,500
completely dead and you'll have very

204
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,240
poor soil aggregation without a doubt

205
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,310
and also the roots themselves some of

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,110
the substances they release help hold

207
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,699
cells together so that's another crucial

208
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,770
thing for grabbing flooding resistance

209
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,550
so this is all new information working

210
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:25,439
into our research this is slide from

211
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,939
Matanikau kniffen a researcher at

212
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,620
cornell so biologists who unfortunately

213
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,689
had a family emergency and couldn't be

214
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,840
here today but this is where she lives

215
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,810
in the rhizosphere very narrow zone soil

216
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,369
just within millimeters of all the plant

217
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,199
roots if you pull up a plant there's

218
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,819
that soil it sticks to the roots that's

219
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,069
really the rhizosphere just that really

220
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,899
narrow it's a hot spot a plant subtle

221
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:48,509
interactions involving microbiota and

222
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,969
again most of them are microbiota that

223
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,730
we're called for that send out signals

224
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,520
to attract those microbiota to benefit

225
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,660
them and so we're learning a lot about

226
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,490
controlling that rhizosphere making the

227
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,320
most of it um

228
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,629
Jenny's research really works a lot on

229
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,519
okay so microbial community we know

230
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:07,469
we've known for a long time that many

231
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,539
farmers of course always been concerned

232
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,460
about disease organisms might have

233
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,650
negative effects but how do we how do we

234
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,629
maximize those those big guys in the

235
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,579
soil that might have these positive

236
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,250
impacts on our plant and now and

237
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:22,349
suppress are the pathogens and those

238
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,870
others and so a lot of work on compost

239
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,689
and various ways to manipulate soil for

240
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,819
that purpose

241
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:31,639
I mentioned pioneers I wanted to mention

242
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,999
you know at least one or two going quite

243
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,188
a ways

244
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,949
this is dr. Sahlman Westman who is a

245
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:39,259
professor at Rutgers University one of

246
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:41,120
the first kind of true a University

247
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,759
accredited you might say cell biologists

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,828
working in the 1920s and 30s he had

249
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,230
grown up on a farm and he was convinced

250
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:51,078
having grown up from he saw so many

251
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,789
diseased plants and animals turned into

252
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:55,219
the soil and somehow this the soil

253
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,958
doesn't just he continued becoming more

254
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,089
and more toxic he was convinced there

255
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,698
had to be he coined the term antibiotics

256
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,350
and they helped purify the soil and at

257
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:05,149
the time he was working penicillin had

258
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,278
been discovered but that was the only

259
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,589
antibiotic we really had take a long

260
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,328
story short after years of research he

261
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,949
does he discovered streptomycin and got

262
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:17,048
the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1952

263
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:19,719
I've coming much more to the present

264
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:23,588
time another kind of something that

265
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,329
happened just about 15-20 years ago is a

266
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,859
lot of talk about soil health emerging

267
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:29,649
around the country around the world and

268
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:31,540
here at Cornell but this thing of what

269
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,328
it's kind of a wishy-washy phrase what

270
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:35,738
is that and what Cornell really has been

271
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:38,378
at the forefront of one of the things

272
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:40,329
Bennett is really developing a new kind

273
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,699
of soil test for the 21st century that

274
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:44,558
goes beyond just the chemistry of soils

275
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:47,588
which is what our parents and

276
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:49,749
grandparents knew about pH acidity then

277
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,609
calcium and magnesium and nutrients in

278
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:53,139
the soil but also integrating into the

279
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:55,149
soil test biological and physical

280
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,980
indicators and I don't have time to go

281
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,600
into a lot of detail about Cornell's

282
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,058
comprehensive assessment it's all Health

283
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,350
Program but we have a table in the back

284
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,789
right here and that's got some

285
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,709
information about this and the website

286
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:06,849
there for those of you interested

287
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,258
there's a lot of of course groups

288
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,180
working on this it's a work in progress

289
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,870
we're always updating this and improving

290
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,059
okay I wanna talk a little bit about

291
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,669
chillage now because I talked about one

292
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,709
way of rebuilding our soils building the

293
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,599
organic matter is this idea of

294
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,920
maintaining vegetative cover so

295
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,779
basically as much of the year as

296
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,189
possible sucking co2 out of the

297
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,799
atmosphere and some of that ends up in

298
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,520
the soil as organic matter it's a pretty

299
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,409
good thing um but what happens with when

300
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,029
we plow and till the soil is that over

301
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,969
oxygenates the soil and it really

302
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,559
accelerates microbial activity that's in

303
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,180
the business of breaking down organic

304
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,829
matter there's nothing wrong with

305
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,439
microbes doing that but if they do it

306
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,360
way too fast it's so called we fans the

307
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,430
flames excessive organic matter

308
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,409
decomposition and those nutrients

309
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,419
disappear before plants can even acquire

310
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,149
them and at least out of the soil this

311
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,860
often on this problem of too much

312
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,049
tillage often begins with a problem of

313
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,340
compaction obviously i've compacted soil

314
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,259
a farmer thinks I've got to go out there

315
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,590
and kill it and plow it so you get on

316
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,379
this vicious circle of um compaction

317
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,019
they need to increase tillage that then

318
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,990
leads to declining organic matter

319
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,759
because oxygenating the soil less

320
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,279
organic matter less food for the soul

321
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,610
food web he were so microbes there now

322
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,039
that reduces soil aggregation poor soil

323
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,930
drainage in the summer from vicious

324
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,120
cycle so the way to get away from this

325
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,679
is it still may need some chilies for

326
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,149
very severe cases of course we're also

327
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,089
integrating into this the idea of using

328
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,980
cover crops to be illogically with their

329
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,480
roots help break up the compaction we're

330
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,230
actually thinking about things such as

331
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,730
on performance and and the worth work

332
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,970
they can do helping break these things

333
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,460
um speaking of pioneers seems like as a

334
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,250
biologist I no matter what I'd get into

335
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,980
chose Darwin was there before me so he

336
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,269
was I saw a biologist to his last book

337
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,220
for those of you don't know so we may

338
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:00,569
know about this was a 200 page book on

339
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,160
earthworms the important role they

340
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,070
played before this many of them were

341
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,839
many people just of his parasitic

342
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,100
creatures but quote from him when I was

343
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,410
one of the most ancient and most

344
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,120
valuable of man's inventions but long

345
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,919
before he existed the land was in fact

346
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,600
very cloudy and still continuously

347
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,620
plowed by earth worms

348
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,769
last they just wanted me someone other

349
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,250
kind of technique for um rebuilding

350
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:27,259
ourselves is directly adding organic

351
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,480
compost or manure and our stuffing is

352
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,399
actually more about pure carbon

353
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,170
substance can be fortified in various

354
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,389
ways or attract microbes to it and be

355
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,799
benefit to the soil and so we'll hear a

356
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,929
little bit more about that I'm sure

357
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,289
today as well so it's never a venue

358
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:46,338
reducing tillage crops directly adding a

359
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:49,009
soil amendments I have just a few slides

360
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,200
left um I wanted to talk about what's

361
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,269
really exciting also and we had a

362
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,240
meeting just before this this morning

363
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:58,250
talking about all these win-win aspects

364
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,778
of soil but something that farmers are

365
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,820
motivated to do strictly from the bottom

366
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,769
line maintaining productivity of their

367
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,180
sorrows in improving their climate

368
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,740
change resilience resilience to extreme

369
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,528
weather events particularly droughts and

370
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,299
flooding and erosion the reasons I

371
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:13,309
mentioned aggregate stability etcetera

372
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:15,919
but also it's what we call a natural

373
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,338
geoengineering solution for carbon

374
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,679
capture

375
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,060
so all that organic matter we store in

376
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,639
the soil that's carbon that's usually

377
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,169
sixty percent or so of carbon that's

378
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,549
carbon uh where would that be otherwise

379
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,708
in the in the air is the greenhouse gas

380
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:30,409
carbon dioxide so that's why there's

381
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:32,958
this interest in this linking of a civil

382
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:35,100
health and climate change

383
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,079
finally just a couple more slides um

384
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,899
what I wanted to emphasize is that you

385
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,690
know we are not in New York here way in

386
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,070
the back of the back of the line about

387
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,940
soil health we have really been at the

388
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,760
forefront farmers and researchers and

389
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,550
our agencies like dairy markets for

390
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,588
conservation also USDA NRCS

391
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,389
working with us we've been at this for

392
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,490
more than twenty years this is a full

393
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,338
picture I pulled the slide that's George

394
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,839
always some of you may know him he was a

395
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,510
plant before he's recently retired plant

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,430
pathologist at Cornell really helped

397
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:10,139
form our first soil health program work

398
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,870
team along with myself then now Harold

399
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,730
and Esther Cornell and but this really

400
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,350
we were responding to you see those

401
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,600
growers there we respond to their

402
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,310
interest I don't know I I don't know if

403
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,810
Daddy brands in that picture might be

404
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:24,359
there one about door panel and I think

405
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,189
part of that first team but we want to

406
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,899
focus on today is season we move towards

407
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,100
the end of the day is yes we've done

408
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,450
these great things we're gonna hear some

409
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,370
of the cool things everybody's doing

410
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,100
working on but where do we go from here

411
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,940
how do we really why isn't everybody

412
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,120
adopting these things that we still are

413
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,399
a long way from full adoption and

414
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,110
maximizing and fully benefiting

415
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,458
ourselves so we need to move forward

416
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,490
we'll talk more about that during the

417
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:50,219
day so finally just specifically about

418
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,470
our project New York so health here's

419
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,629
kind of what our near-term objectives

420
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,149
that we're working on um identifying

421
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:00,059
barriers to adoption we're using soil

422
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,879
surveys farmer surveys etc other ways of

423
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,679
looking at that one a funny economic an

424
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,179
environmental benefits one thing a lot

425
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,208
of farmers ask that are interested in

426
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:11,250
this is yes I see and I hear about these

427
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,958
benefits but how long will it take for

428
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,690
me to see those benefits is it going to

429
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,698
be two years five years 20 years because

430
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,529
we'll see in one of our presentations

431
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,469
later this afternoon it depends on which

432
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:23,639
benefit you're talking um so it does

433
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,350
vary and it's going to get better

434
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,149
information about that innovative

435
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,589
cropping systems and so ecology research

436
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,419
we'll hear about that from a number of

437
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,449
our speakers today and some of them been

438
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:35,129
funded through our project research on I

439
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:37,859
would check on compost another thing I

440
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,149
know area of research were funding and

441
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,940
this are very relevant to what's

442
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,278
happening today and very big part New

443
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,990
York so like I said it's everybody it's

444
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,309
not a criminal thing

445
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,930
and it's really promoting stay when a

446
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,379
communication coordination and

447
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,549
collaboration one of our major goals is

448
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,778
almost accomplished and there's several

449
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,969
hours that we'll really accomplished

450
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,708
hold the first statewide still has some

451
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,950
we hope it's the first of others to

452
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,659
follow and also something we'll hope to

453
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,850
accomplish beginning it's an input from

454
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,500
you later today I'm gathering input from

455
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,889
the full range of stakeholders for on

456
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,659
New York's future we already many of you

457
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,559
are involved in that already I will get

458
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,559
input for more of you

459
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,600
this has been a production of Cornell

460
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,600
University on the web at Cornell edu
