1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,320
University okay good morning I thought

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,719
I'd put my acknowledgement slide first

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,439
since the end is I was hard to get to so

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,239
the numerous people that were possible

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,719
that made the research possible that

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,439
I'll talk about in a bit um as well as

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,960
many funding sources that made this

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,359
possible and there's probably oversight

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,558
but this is a decent St at um the people

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,480
that have contributed what I wanted to

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,238
do was first kind of put things into

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,038
perspective and talk a little bit about

14
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,558
the Flor culture and horiculture uh and

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,960
the importance that they are in the US

16
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:46,479
and the New York economy um and then

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,320
talk a bit more about abiotic stress

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,878
tolerance and then kind of okay look at

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,159
case studies and abiotic stress

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,640
tolerance in floriculture crops which

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,839
would be a primary focus of my uh

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,558
research program so if you look at uh

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,439
the horiculture industry in the US you

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:08,118
can broadly divide it into three groups

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,559
uh fruits nuts and berries which in 2007

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,319
were worth $8.6 billion wholesale

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,478
Farmgate value second would be Nursery

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,199
Greenhouse and sod so floriculture would

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,879
very much fit into this category so

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,640
these would be the crops that you can't

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:25,158
eat but you can still enjoy them um and

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,599
then vegetables for 14.7 billion so

33
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,920
collectively about $50 billion worth of

34
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
of Horticultural crops if you compare

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,399
compare that to the the hundreds of

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
millions of acres of corn and soybeans

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,079
and wheat that are grown they're valued

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:43,000
at 77.2 billion so this would be a much

39
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,438
more intensive type of Agriculture

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,799
production the floriculture industry

41
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,039
specifically in the US which would be

42
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,439
comprised primarily of cut flowers

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,640
potted plants bedding plants um and

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,158
propagative materials cuttings and seeds

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,599
and bulbs and things like that that go

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
into the above crops it's about a $4

47
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,000
billion do industry a year it has

48
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,679
declined a little bit since the

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,719
recession in 2008 so it was uh higher uh

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,439
back in

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,159
2007 uh and uh among the the various

52
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,400
types of crops that we grow bedding

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,759
plants which would be annuals and

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,439
perennials that are grown um primarily

55
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,199
in the spring and sold in the spring and

56
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,079
then are supposed to be transplanted

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,479
into your landscape or transplanted into

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
um into hanging uh baskets and

59
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,679
containers and things like that they

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,800
make up about $2 billion are about half

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,400
of the US floriculture industry and

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,879
those will be the crops that I'm going

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,519
to primarily focus on a little bit with

64
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,679
potted plants as well which would be

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,158
things like poin Zetas and orchids that

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,000
we're more enjoying inside our house um

67
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,158
and then throwing away once they look

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,280
ugly if you're like me so New York

69
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:55,439
State's floriculture industry has about

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,360
uh 600 production operations with a

71
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:02,439
wholesale value approaching $200 million

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
uh we have 568 Acres of green houses and

73
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,120
our national ranking has varied from

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,680
about 5ifth to 8th since I've been in

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,759
New York and it sort of just depends on

76
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,760
the year and how well uh New York

77
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,679
Growers did and as that compares to the

78
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,280
rest of the country so if we have six

79
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,040
good weekends of sales in April and May

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,039
and early June that can that can uh

81
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,598
really improve the economic value even

82
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,598
the wholesale value of our

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,680
industry uh and to put it into context

84
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:35,759
if you look at the uh other agriculture

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,080
Commodities in New York state um the top

86
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,039
four or so are all related to the dairy

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,719
industry pretty much so either milk or

88
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,878
uh feed stocks to support the milk

89
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,400
production um and then apples would be

90
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,759
number five and floriculture would be uh

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,560
number

92
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,479
six so the question is why study a

93
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,959
biotic stress tolerance and we'll back

94
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,399
up and take kind of this holistic

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,400
worldwide perspective and if you think

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,120
about the increasing worldwide scarcity

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,200
of resources such as water uh aable land

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,319
and then fossil fuels uh which we need

99
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,359
to either heat green houses or run farm

100
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,199
equipment or bring things to Market uh

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,319
fossil fuels are also the inputs for U

102
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,959
petrochemicals which are used heavily in

103
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,918
agriculture and horiculture as well uh

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,079
so in addition global climate change

105
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,240
means that we're having these more

106
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,800
erratic temperatures and more erratic

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,160
water availability and in general if we

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,759
have plants that are more resistant to

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,039
any of these stresses whether they be

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,960
drought or heat uh maybe cold stress if

111
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:40,719
we could grow a plant in a greenhouse

112
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,599
with with less heat and allow it to be

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,360
colder um this would improve our

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,520
situation in terms of producing more

115
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,520
crops using resources uh more

116
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,240
efficiently and I thought this was

117
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,800
interesting this was from uh the UN the

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,439
project the projected world population

119
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,079
and we're currently at uh 7 billion um

120
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,959
and this could go probably following the

121
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,000
the kind of medium thought by the UN is

122
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,478
that this would go up to um 9 billion in

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,120
Fairly short order and peaking out at

124
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,918
about uh 10 billion or so however if you

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,720
look at kind of a worst case scenario

126
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,639
for world population it would be

127
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,759
increasing just as fast over the next

128
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,759
100 years as it has for the past 100

129
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:30,879
years uh and so um besides the

130
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,799
population growing to 9 billion by 2040

131
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,439
the UN tells us that by

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
2030 um Beyond population growth we're

133
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,120
going to have 3 billion more middleclass

134
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,799
consumers which mean people that can

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,879
afford to eat either more calories or

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,600
more calories as meat or uh other other

137
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,519
uh high quality food stuffs so we're

138
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,000
going to need to be able to produce 50%

139
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:56,318
more food um and yet uh with this we're

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,560
going to need 45% more energy to do that

141
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,960
and 30% more water to do that

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,560
um and I'm going to be talking about

143
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,478
abiotic stress and the reason I'm going

144
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,120
to do that is I'm not an inist or a

145
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,120
pathologist so I don't work with insect

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,038
stresses or virus stresses or disease

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,560
stresses but essentially things like

148
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,399
salinity drought heat chilling freezing

149
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,720
flooding um nutrients whether they're

150
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,079
inadequate or they're they're

151
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
excessive um I thought this was funny

152
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,560
this was someone's hanging basket that

153
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,960
they killed because of drought stress

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,720
and so they put a couple skulls on it to

155
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,719
decorate it for Halloween

156
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,719
um and so you might ask when do

157
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,280
floriculture crops exhibit abiotic

158
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,120
stress if we're growing them in these

159
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,638
nice perfect Greenhouse environments um

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,079
and I would argue that the plants are

161
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,879
potentially experiencing stress at many

162
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,279
different stages throughout their life

163
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,399
it could be yes in the production stage

164
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,359
in the greenhouse whether the grower

165
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,560
forgets to irrigate them or doesn't want

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,080
to irrigate them as much as they like

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,759
whether the grow whether the greenhouse

168
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,359
gets excessively hot and in the

169
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,199
summertime when the sun does come out um

170
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,919
green houses heat up very quickly that's

171
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,598
called the greenhouse effect they trap

172
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,560
in heat um and also there's there's been

173
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,319
look uh by Farmers trying to use

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,199
minimally heated or unheated greenh

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
houses simple structures such as high

176
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,598
Tunnels for growing Greenhouse crops and

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,800
that's been I've done some research in

178
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,199
that area as well and so if you have

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,038
plants that can handle you know chilling

180
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,079
stresses or freezing stresses during

181
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,159
production that would be helpful for

182
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,038
them as well so besides just the

183
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,479
greenhouse production stage

184
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,199
then you can look at the retail stage of

185
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,478
the crop uh so my daughter and I walked

186
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
into Walmart last spring and we saw

187
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,560
these nice impatience hanging baskets

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,720
here and I asked my four-year-old

189
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,280
daughter okay what's what's wrong with

190
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,479
the plant on the right and she said

191
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,559
Daddy does it need more water and I said

192
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:53,279
yes you got it but the the truth is um

193
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,439
about half of the Flor culture products

194
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,079
that we sell are marketed through these

195
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,918
big box stores and when they get there

196
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,079
very little attention is paid to caring

197
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,918
for them so a large grower that I spoke

198
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,918
to in Michigan said that if uh he uh he

199
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,918
sells his plants into large

200
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,839
supermarkets um he says if they don't

201
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,758
sell them within three days at the

202
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,878
supermarket they pretty much go into the

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,479
dumpster and so despite the fact that

204
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,240
you could theoretically continue to

205
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,079
water this plant to fertilize this plant

206
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,038
and care for it before it gets purchased

207
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,439
by a consumer and brought to their house

208
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,318
it just isn't happening and so if we

209
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,120
could add you know some days on to the

210
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,199
shelf life of that plant that would be

211
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,479
beneficial

212
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,360
um okay and then of course in the

213
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,080
landscape or like in this hanging basket

214
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,440
essentially once the product gets to the

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,719
consumer if we can make it last longer

216
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,560
and make it more enjoyable for them uh

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,519
we're more likely to engage the the

218
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,439
public in buying Flor culture

219
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,159
products so if we look at why it's

220
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,839
important to improve the abiotic stress

221
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,360
tolerance in floriculture crops you

222
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,440
could think of kind of the the

223
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,959
short-term maybe current um grower

224
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,920
mentality and that would be to improve

225
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,479
profitability so if you have plants more

226
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,958
resistant to to stress or these problems

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
you're going to reduce crop losses or

228
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,239
get away with a higher quality crop even

229
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,000
though uh maybe uh uh old-fashioned

230
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,440
petunia variety that from 20 years ago

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,759
may not have put up with that kind of

232
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,880
stress and may have died uh quickly uh

233
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,000
it can allow us to reduce input such as

234
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,559
water uh fertilizer and energy um and

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,679
improve consumer success with the

236
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,078
products um ultimately I kind of look at

237
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,359
it more as the long-term survival of the

238
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,399
industry and so in light of all of these

239
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,800
lining resources worldwide floriculture

240
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,360
is going to need to compete against

241
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,519
Agriculture and if our society looks at

242
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,399
okay uh we need fruit and vegetables and

243
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,759
grain crops because we eat them we may

244
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,320
not need um flow so they may be this

245
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,958
perception as flowers as a luxury item

246
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,160
and so if there's competing resources a

247
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:57,239
luxury item is going to eventually lose

248
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:01,838
out so what are your thoughts in the the

249
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,839
audience here today are flowers luxury

250
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:10,479
item there's no right answer yes or

251
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,719
no where they are

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,440
yeah

253
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,079
okay if if all right depends where they

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
are if they're in your house or in your

255
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:21,559
garden

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,200
others maybe it depends if you're

257
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,439
wellfed every day then they no then um

258
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,920
then you're not thinking so much about

259
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,440
your caloric intake and then um then

260
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,278
they're not so so much a luxury item so

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,480
I would I would counter some of the

262
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,078
arguments with okay so flowers are a

263
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,600
luxury item how about fresh tomatoes in

264
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,599
New York in

265
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
January which you know there could be

266
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,920
several months of the year where our

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,360
ancestors lived on root vegetables for

268
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,278
uh you know for years and years and

269
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,959
years and so uh growing these crops

270
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,200
somewhere else or in a heated Greenhouse

271
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,559
uh could be a luxury item and bananas

272
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,040
year round in the US grain-fed meat um

273
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,479
and then you could go even farther and

274
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,039
think about you know what are all of the

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,240
ways that we spend our carbon footprint

276
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,679
like driving a car to work every day um

277
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,759
taking a plane to go to annual

278
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,159
conferences and things like that so in

279
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,000
the end I think there's not this black

280
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,559
and white area where flower should be

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,399
labeled a luxury item but it's more of

282
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:23,000
this grayscale of how does our how does

283
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,759
our society prioritize how we you know

284
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,639
allocate the resources that we

285
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,958
have um and I would argue that you know

286
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,680
we all know flowers beautify our

287
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
surroundings like Alex mentioned you

288
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:37,078
know if they're Outdoors um there's

289
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,879
there's research that shows that if you

290
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,879
landscape a house properly it can

291
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,159
increase the resale value by as much as

292
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,759
14% um and you know that we've had

293
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,519
houses sitting on the market for a long

294
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,278
time a well landscaped house apparently

295
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,440
sells uh six weeks sooner so there's a

296
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,480
real uh a real economic value associated

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
with them there if you look at plants in

298
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,560
an indoor environment you know that you

299
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,600
can look at dozens of papers that find

300
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,919
specific benefits such as they reduce

301
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,480
the carbon dioxide in an indoor

302
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,958
environment they reduce the volatile

303
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,519
organic uh compounds uh one study found

304
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,000
worker productivity was increased 12% if

305
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,799
there were X number of house plants per

306
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,360
um square feet of office space and

307
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,039
likewise reduced employee sick days um

308
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
work with hospitals finds decreased

309
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:27,120
length of Hospital stay so those are all

310
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:30,120
very real um economic values as

311
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,399
well uh as so if I were to summarize my

312
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,039
research program over the past five

313
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,958
years the central theme could be abiotic

314
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,919
stress tolerance and then there would be

315
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,039
different aspects of it that I've looked

316
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,838
at um and a couple I'm not really going

317
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:48,278
to focus on today so um fertilizers and

318
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,160
fertilizer use efficiency with either um

319
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,439
uh conventional fertilizers or organic

320
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,278
fertilizers has been a large part of my

321
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,279
research program but we'll save that for

322
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:59,439
a different discussion um as well I've

323
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,159
collaborated with Chris wean to look at

324
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,920
um growing bedding plants in unheated

325
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,000
High tunnels and you know sort of

326
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,519
sorting out which uh species and

327
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,399
cultivars are more successful under

328
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,759
those conditions and which ones are not

329
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,360
and what are you know the the length uh

330
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,278
the lengthening of the crop production

331
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,480
time that it might take and what are the

332
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,559
effects on plant quality but instead

333
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,159
we're going to focus just on uh these

334
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,239
three primary topics um and so we'll

335
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,838
start by looking at screening for salt

336
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,159
tolerance and then we'll move on to look

337
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,839
at um exogenous compounds to improve

338
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,360
tolerance and then finally some

339
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,560
molecular techniques so first screening

340
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,720
for salt and drought tolerance and why

341
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,719
the focus on um drought and salt stress

342
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,399
so a lot of the abiotic stress tolerance

343
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,199
I talk about will be drought and salt

344
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,078
stress but not all of it you'll see some

345
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,039
different

346
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,000
stresses um so agriculture accounts for

347
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,439
70% of global Water use and irrigated

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,600
land is quite important um it represents

349
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,240
only about 20% of Farmland but um IT

350
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,800
Supplies 42% of the world's food so it's

351
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,399
you know very efficient land um in terms

352
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,479
of production um yields um saline soils

353
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,958
also represent 7% of the world land area

354
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,000
and so if we're looking at needing this

355
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,919
increasing amount of aable land or land

356
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,120
that we can access to increase our food

357
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,599
supply by 50% we're going to have to be

358
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,360
better at growing crops either on saing

359
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:27,320
soils uh or using saing irrigation

360
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,120
water um and in some cases drought and

361
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,360
salt stress might be thought of as

362
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,000
having similar effects on the plant some

363
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,680
of the effects uh would be osmotic

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,159
effects or you know high salt

365
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,120
concentration in the in the soil makes

366
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,559
it difficult for roots to extract enough

367
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,039
water um to meet the needs of the top

368
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,319
part of the plant and so that can be

369
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,599
thought of as a physiological drought so

370
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,759
wilting shorter plants reduced Leaf

371
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,320
surface area and then the responses of

372
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,199
the plant such as stodal closure or an

373
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,079
increase in reactive oxygen species um

374
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,838
and then depending on the type of salt

375
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,239
that you're looking at certainly there

376
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,920
can be more salt specific effects so

377
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,278
that could be seen you know like the

378
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,479
cell damage here which could be due to

379
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,559
excess accumulation of sodium and

380
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,800
chloride leading to cell wall disruption

381
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,799
and previous to that enzyme disruption

382
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,679
so

383
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:21,359
on um so the first person in my lab was

384
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,519
um Gonzalo Vino he started as a master

385
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
student now he's a PhD student um his

386
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,519
first project with me was to screen 14

387
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
of the most popular bedding plants for

388
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,720
salt to tolerance so I wanted to see

389
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,600
okay of the of the plants that were that

390
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,278
we growing uh how problematic is it and

391
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
then using this develop some practical

392
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,600
guidelines for Greenhouse Growers so in

393
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,560
the end Gonzalez selected 14 species the

394
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,319
ones highlighted in red could be thought

395
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,359
of as as among the kind of top 10 um

396
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,120
floriculture crops and there's a a

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,039
couple that aren't in the top 10 that we

398
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,000
didn't have um and essentially uh had

399
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,599
seedlings uh that we started we

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,198
transplanted them and grew them on for 5

401
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,800
weeks exposing them uh to sodium

402
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,278
chloride in the irrigation water and

403
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,078
that ranged from 0 up to 80

404
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,679
Mill and then um you could look at their

405
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,198
growth in terms of relative uh dry

406
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,638
weight for example so that would be um

407
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,078
if the looking at the dry weight of a

408
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,120
zero millimar plant um and then what is

409
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,479
the you know corresponding percent

410
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,039
reduction in relative dry weight and if

411
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,039
you do that then you can look at all of

412
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,799
the plants together and see which ones

413
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,198
are the most tolerant to to uh this

414
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,318
particular salt stress and which ones

415
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:39,879
are the most sensitive uh if you don't

416
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,360
do this type of equilibration then

417
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,240
you're looking at okay maybe patunas are

418
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,000
a much larger plant to start with than

419
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,799
pansy and so it's difficult to look at

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,600
you know the shape of the curve and how

421
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,919
sensitive they are so what we found is

422
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,319
yes Peter every every watering contain

423
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,159
that amount so every watering did so it

424
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,278
was a pretty excessive continually

425
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:05,678
adding more more and more that's right

426
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:07,359
uhhuh um we did take um weekly uh pour

427
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,038
through leate values to look at what was

428
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,719
the ph and what was the electrical

429
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,199
conductivity inside of the root Zone and

430
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,480
what we found is that after a couple

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,519
weeks we got a pretty stable uh EC in

432
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,919
the root Zone we did that because we

433
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,000
applied a a bit uh excess irrigation

434
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,919
water so every time we watered we

435
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,160
leeched a little bit of water and that

436
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,799
also leeched out a bit of soluble salts

437
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,558
uh as well MH

438
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,240
uh so looking at just just a few of the

439
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,480
plants so we found Snapdragon and

440
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,480
petunia were among the most tolerant

441
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,759
that adding this 80 millimar sodium

442
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,160
chloride after 5 weeks they were about

443
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,919
half the size of controled plants

444
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,798
whereas there were some plants like uh

445
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,200
pansy which were all dead at the end of

446
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,000
the 5we

447
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
period um

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,159
so uh snapdragons will be representative

449
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,599
of the the tolerant group and they they

450
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,159
produce uh Mana to uh carbohydrate that

451
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,240
can act as an

452
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,400
osmoprotectant um pansies are very

453
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,558
sensitive selvia were were quite

454
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,919
sensitive and and Bonia you know kind of

455
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,798
intermediate in their sensitivity and

456
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,840
tolerance so in the end uh we came up

457
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,798
with this grouping where the most

458
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:22,079
tolerant species we said had their dry

459
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,839
weight reduced by 50 to 70% with 80

460
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,199
Millar sodium chloride um and these are

461
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,279
somewhat artificial but you know we

462
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,759
looked at the 14 species and were there

463
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,720
kind of some obvious groups that came

464
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,440
out of it uh somewhat tolerant plants uh

465
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,120
moderately sensitive and then the

466
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,960
extremely sensitive plants were zy and

467
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:44,079
pansy which had 100% mortality at high

468
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,440
salts um I had the opportunity now now

469
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,798
peas are not a floriculture crop I guess

470
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,038
sweet peas are a floriculture crop um

471
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,519
but I had a visiting scientist from

472
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,240
Pakistan last year and and um and prior

473
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,839
to that I had met him virtually and had

474
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,440
gotten to serve as a member of his

475
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:04,279
graduate committee uh he has been

476
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,558
looking at the effect of salt stress on

477
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:08,879
peas and initially did screening studies

478
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,720
to look at which P genotypes were more

479
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,039
tolerant and what were some of the

480
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,440
underlying reasons for that uh and then

481
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,038
uh he went on to look at some exogenous

482
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,080
applications of of compounds to improve

483
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,798
that tolerance and I'll talk about that

484
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,279
in a minute as well so p is apparently

485
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,158
an important crop in Pakistan it's an

486
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,879
important um for the food of their

487
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,520
culture um Pakistan as well as 11th in

488
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,679
the world in PE production uh producing

489
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,119
84,000 tons on 12,000 hectares um and

490
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,480
they also have problems with salt

491
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,759
apparently 20% of their arable land is

492
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,558
is affected by

493
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,679
salt uh and so the work that he did um

494
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:52,000
is initially screening these 30p

495
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,798
genotypes um to sodium chloride in the

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
irrigation water um and that was added

497
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:02,158
to achieve thresholds of uh 0 2.55 or

498
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,200
7.5 Deans uh per meter so that'll be

499
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,000
measured with a electrical conductivity

500
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,640
meter and eventually from those 30 he he

501
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,200
chose two that were quite Sol quite salt

502
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,120
tolerant and representative of that

503
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,558
group and two that were quite sensitive

504
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,479
and representative of that group um and

505
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,678
then he further went on to look at some

506
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,798
of their uh the uh morphology and

507
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,798
Physiology associated with their

508
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,079
resistance and their tolerance and just

509
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,599
to highlight uh couple of his

510
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,759
interesting findings so we have um two

511
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,879
cultivars they're Ambassador and pf400

512
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,319
which were salt sensitive and then we

513
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,760
have two cultivar Climax and samarina

514
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:44,079
aard which were tolerant uh and looking

515
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,240
at plant dry weight in response to

516
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:50,000
increasing salinity and I found that the

517
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,240
most tolerant cultivars um showed very

518
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,919
little decrease whereas there was this

519
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,480
you know quite linear quite quite uh

520
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,200
strong decrease in plant dry weight for

521
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,919
the sensitive cultivar s um a very

522
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
similar pattern was found as well for

523
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,720
seed weight and for yield of the plant

524
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,400
so I'm not going to show those graphs

525
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,000
but essentially you know just by

526
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,559
selecting from existing cultivars you

527
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,558
could you could choose plants that are

528
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,480
more uh uh able to be used on these

529
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,158
saline

530
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,599
soils um this is interesting this is uh

531
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,799
the graphs could be difficult to read

532
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,038
but it's sodium content in the roots on

533
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,720
the left side and the leaves on the

534
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:31,400
right side uh and what he found is that

535
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,038
the two most tolerant cultivars actually

536
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,080
accumulated a lot of sodium in their uh

537
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:40,919
Roots um but that did not get

538
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,480
translocated to their leav so in the end

539
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,720
the the the sensitive cultivars

540
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,360
accumulated a lot of sodium in their

541
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,000
leaves so could be that you know sort of

542
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,678
um uh trapped or held by the roots or

543
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,519
just not you know uh they had

544
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,159
selectivity in their translocation and

545
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:02,079
did not translocate that to their leaves

546
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,320
uh then uh Suite of antioxidant enzymes

547
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,278
was looked at and we talked about you

548
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,119
know with a salt or increasing salt and

549
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:11,798
drought stress you would expect the

550
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,918
plant to respond by um enhancing its

551
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,119
antioxidant enzyme content and

552
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,799
expression um and what we found is that

553
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,678
the sensitive cultivars really did not

554
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,558
do that to a very large degree so there

555
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,519
would be the the dark blue bar and the

556
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,960
Red Bar um you know really minor kind of

557
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,639
increments in their antioxidant enzyme

558
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,679
expression whereas the more uh tolerant

559
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
cultivars that seems to be a decently

560
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,159
large mechanism involved in their

561
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,880
tolerance they were able to almost

562
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,080
double the antioxidant enzymes and this

563
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
is super oxide dismutase but that is

564
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,199
representative of several of other of

565
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,558
the enzymes that he looked at um another

566
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,880
mechanism for uh salt tolerance uh can

567
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,399
be we talked about um osmo protectants

568
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,799
and so glycine beta was one of the

569
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,559
osmolytes that was looked at um and that

570
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,679
was a quite similar story as the uh

571
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,000
antioxidant enzymes where it really did

572
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,000
not increase to much of a degree for the

573
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
sensitive plants but the tolerant plants

574
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,759
exposed to high salts um you know

575
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,159
doubled the amount of uh osmolytes that

576
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,679
they

577
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,440
had uh so the conclusion from that work

578
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
was that salt stress significantly

579
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,360
reduced these these attributes that we

580
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,038
looked at growth and yield and so on um

581
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,119
but the the salt tolerance potential of

582
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,400
P genot types is high linked with a

583
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,558
couple of these traits and that was

584
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,519
osmolytes and antioxidant enzymes um as

585
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,079
well as the restricted movement of

586
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,440
sodium chloride from the roots to the

587
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,158
leaves and so if you were selecting you

588
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,038
know if you were going back to screen

589
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,600
you know 30 genotypes 100 genotypes of

590
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,319
peas and looking at which ones were

591
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,359
tolerant to Salt these would these would

592
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:52,519
probably be good characteristics to look

593
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,879
at as indicators for uh for salt to

594
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,879
tolerant

595
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,240
genotypes uh so with that I wanted uh

596
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,079
look at exogenous compounds that uh can

597
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,159
improve tolerance and so you could think

598
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,240
about okay is there something that I can

599
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,200
spray on my plant or apply to my plant

600
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,038
that can make it withstand this uh this

601
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,038
stress better um and so my colleague in

602
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,798
Pakistan has looked at brino steroids

603
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,558
and I'll talk about them first they're

604
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,038
uh from the steroid class of hormones

605
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,519
and they apparently improve membrane

606
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,640
stability and osmotic adjustment and

607
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,119
also have effects you know on Gene

608
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,679
signaling and enhancing the plant

609
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:35,398
defense system um a second project I'll

610
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,000
talk about was with uh seaweed or a kelp

611
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,959
extract a commercial product called

612
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,519
stimplex um and it does have uh High

613
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,360
concentration of beta en which are

614
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,200
acting as osmolytes but it really

615
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,119
contains hundreds of compounds and we're

616
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,759
just beginning to understand which of

617
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,599
those hundreds of compounds are are

618
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,919
important in the stress tolerance

619
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,158
benefits of seaweed um and then last a

620
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,360
silicon which is considered uh

621
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:03,679
beneficial nutrient but not an essential

622
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,798
nutrient um and it apparently mediates

623
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,519
uh systemic resistance by the plant does

624
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:10,158
have an effect on antioxidant enzyme

625
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,240
expression and membrane stability so

626
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,760
we'll delve into those a little bit more

627
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,558
so a bit more with with adon's work um

628
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:23,119
and and he he's gotten 50 pages written

629
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:26,200
on this in his PhD thesis um but to

630
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,719
summarize this simply uh one experiment

631
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,960
that he did with this brasino steroid

632
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
was uh soak seeds with a brino steroid

633
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,360
or not soak them with a brino steroid um

634
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,679
prior to Salt stress and he did that as

635
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,319
a seed soaking treatment as well uh and

636
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,960
he used uh 1 Millar sodium chloride and

637
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,839
10 Millar sodium

638
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,720
chloride uh and whereas the type of

639
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,398
brassinosteroid that he used was applied

640
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,640
at uh 10

641
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,079
micromolar uh and if you look at the the

642
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,240
plant dry weight now I don't have

643
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,639
significance bars in here uh to make

644
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,960
things brief but essentially so if you

645
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,759
if you soaked the seeds in salt uh that

646
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,919
reduced their dry weight if you uh

647
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,599
soaked them in the brino steroid first

648
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,880
and then with with salt um you could

649
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,639
enhance the dry weight even above the

650
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,760
control dry weight and he's also got

651
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,240
treatments where he just used the the

652
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:25,119
brino steroid and their their dry weight

653
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,640
was even greater than than these plants

654
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,119
um and he looked at several different

655
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,919
parameters that were associated with

656
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,839
them

657
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,278
and he found that the brino steroids did

658
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,879
improve the the activity or the

659
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,960
production of antioxidant enzymes uh

660
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,919
increase photosynthetic parameters and

661
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,319
so on so this could be a uh you know

662
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,759
potentially useful tool in mitigating

663
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,720
the salt

664
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,278
stress uh I had a chi couple Chinese

665
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,079
scientists that looked with this

666
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:55,839
commercial extract of kelp um and

667
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,720
looking at whether this alleviated salt

668
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,959
stress in petunia verbina tomato and

669
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,960
snap dragon um and essentially what we

670
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,360
did is we grew these seedlings we

671
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,159
transplanted them um and then kind of

672
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,519
similar to gonzalo's work we gave them

673
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,919
salt um continuously in the irrigation

674
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,918
water and that was 40 Millar um salt so

675
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,120
what we have noted here is that we have

676
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,520
the treatments are without sodium

677
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,479
chloride uh without sodium chloride and

678
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,599
then those are minus stimplex or that

679
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,759
kelp extract or plus stimplex which is

680
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,639
that kelp extract and then we have plus

681
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:34,519
40 molar sodium chloride but without the

682
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,880
kelp extract plus sodium chloride um and

683
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,798
with that kelp

684
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,080
extract and in

685
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,879
particular um we see we saw this trend

686
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,599
for all four species but with cunia and

687
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,080
verbina it was significant for all of

688
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,639
the treatments is that if we have

689
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,240
control plants so not exposed to Salt so

690
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,519
that would be like the blue bar on the

691
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,480
left if we then expose them to weekly

692
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,159
drenches of stimplex which was applied

693
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,558
at 5 milliliters per liter of this

694
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,399
commercial preparation we got a

695
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,119
significant increase in the dry weight

696
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,119
of the plant and this could relate to

697
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,439
you know the cyto kindan potentially in

698
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,359
it or other

699
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,240
compounds uh then if we if we take a

700
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,398
plant that that is exposed to 40 Millar

701
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,159
sodium chloride so like this petunia in

702
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:20,839
the green bar uh you see that its growth

703
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,159
is much reduced uh compared to plants

704
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:27,398
that didn't get salt uh and if we add

705
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,559
this uh this stimplex this kelp extract

706
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:31,599
we saw a sign significant increase in

707
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:33,798
its dry weight so not enough you know to

708
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,079
get it anywhere back close to the

709
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,918
control dry weight this was a pretty

710
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,798
severe salt stress though um so that

711
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,840
that we saw with pertunia and

712
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,679
verbina um one of the things that we

713
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,359
looked at um was a response for some of

714
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,480
the photosynthetic

715
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:54,240
parameters um and if you look at just

716
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,480
net photosynthetic rate what we found

717
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,919
and I apologize for the changes in color

718
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,159
but the the setup is very similar

719
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,840
is that um could plants that were not

720
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,559
treated with salt but received this uh

721
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:11,678
kelp extract um had a greatly increased

722
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,278
photosynthetic rate uh however when we

723
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,519
looked at plants that had been treated

724
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,240
with salt and then we looked at their

725
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,240
photosynthetic rate we did not see any

726
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,880
significant differences between them and

727
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,278
it could be at that point you know the

728
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,960
cells were so impaired that there was

729
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:25,960
not this particular Improvement on

730
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,640
photosynthesis but quite interesting

731
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,840
that even control plants you know not

732
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,919
treated with salt but got this kelp

733
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,918
extract had improved photosynthetic

734
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,000
rate uh We've also started some trials

735
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,440
where we've um grown these plants in a

736
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,398
greenhouse with weekly drenches of kelp

737
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,600
extract um and then we bring them to

738
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,798
kind of a simulated retail environment

739
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:53,240
so um just indoors um water them once

740
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,759
and then we let them we let them Wilt as

741
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,200
they will and we find that so this is a

742
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,679
tomato 5 days with no water and our

743
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,038
control plant if you can see looks you

744
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,399
know somewhat more wilted than our kelp

745
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,519
extract treated

746
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:09,959
plant and we're um we're repeating that

747
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,558
research right now um with a new uh

748
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,880
visiting Chinese

749
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:17,720
scientist um and we're going to look at

750
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,720
that in uh petunia and

751
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:22,839
tomato um so some of you have heard me

752
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,679
speak before in Silicon the use of

753
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,639
silicon as a potentially beneficial

754
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:31,159
nutrient has uh has been a topic of

755
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,480
Interest for some years now in my lab um

756
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,440
and silicon is naturally found in soils

757
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,278
um plants absorb silicon as cicc acid

758
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,960
which is Si

759
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:45,759
I4 or o4 H4 um so a single unit of

760
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,038
silicon surrounded by four oxygens and

761
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,759
four hydrogens

762
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:54,759
um and uh the people that have looked at

763
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:57,440
okay what elements are necessary for a

764
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,440
plant to complete its life cycle um as

765
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,320
far as they been able to exclude silicon

766
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,240
out of say hydroponic Solutions and look

767
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,398
at it they've never been able to prove

768
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,038
that silicon was absolutely needed for

769
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:11,678
higher plants to complete their life

770
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:14,158
cycle um but we find that um there's a

771
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,120
lot of reports rice was a good example

772
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,320
that uh rice accumulates something like

773
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,079
5 to 10% of its dry weight um is silicon

774
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,480
so that's even more than nitrogen which

775
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,879
is the the you know essential nutrient

776
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,360
that it takes in the greatest quantity

777
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,679
um that if you farmed rice in the same

778
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,439
field for several decades the soil can

779
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,080
become depleted of the Silicon um and

780
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,159
then they started seeing plants that

781
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,319
were more prone to getting diseases and

782
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,440
if they supplemented that soil back with

783
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,960
silicon either like a potassium silicate

784
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,000
or calcium silicate or just by returning

785
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,440
say um say rice holes back to the soil

786
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,079
that they would see this beneficial

787
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,798
response uh to disease tolerance and

788
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,319
there's this growing body of research

789
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,240
that um that the same is true with

790
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:01,319
various abiotic stresses as well so with

791
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,960
floriculture crops um we're typically

792
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,879
growing them in a potting mix that

793
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,880
doesn't have soil so we don't expect a

794
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,600
lot of silicon to be there it's Pete and

795
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,000
perlite and some added nutrients what we

796
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,759
found uh when we've looked at the

797
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,398
soiless substrates that we've used that

798
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:19,158
they have about 08 Millar silicon in

799
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,158
them um the tap water at Cornell has a

800
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,720
little bit of silicon as an impurity in

801
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,200
it so .03 millimar silicon and

802
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,440
fertilizers might have a little bit of

803
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,240
impurity in it so we wonder okay is that

804
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,038
enough uh silicon impurity that if we

805
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,519
add more silicon it's not going to have

806
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,038
any effect on the plant or is the

807
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,159
opposite true is it beneficial to add

808
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:42,278
this uh the supplemental silicon so what

809
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,240
we did is we grew uh 21 Flor culture

810
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:47,679
species we gave them 10 weekly drenches

811
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,759
of either Z or four millimar silicon

812
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,880
from potassium silicate and then we

813
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,319
looked at uh Leaf tissue

814
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,080
silicon and this this can be hard to

815
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,918
look at this is the 21 species that we

816
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,720
looked at and we found that there their

817
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,038
Leaf silicon content varied from um

818
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
Petunia on the left side when it was

819
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:08,278
unamended with potassium silicate had a

820
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,319
concentration of about 200 parts per

821
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,599
million um when we amended it with

822
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,000
silicon that that did go up to 500 parts

823
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:18,038
per million um all the way up to plants

824
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,558
like verbina or granthum and terrania

825
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:24,278
which had up to about 4,000 or 4500

826
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:26,599
parts per million uh silicon and so here

827
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:29,000
the dark bars refer to plants that were

828
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,678
unamended with with silicon and the open

829
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,319
bars are plants that were amended with

830
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,480
silicon so you'll see examples

831
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,918
especially some of the Silicon

832
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,880
accumulating plants that are here on the

833
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,038
right side so uh when we did amend them

834
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,760
with silicon we see fairly dramatic

835
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:44,519
increases in the leaf tissue levels and

836
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,119
then there's a a broad group of plants

837
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,960
down here that accumulate fairly low

838
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:51,798
levels of silicon um and so like this

839
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,720
tuous Bonia if we add silicon to the

840
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,440
potassium silicate to the soil there was

841
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,480
no further enhancement of of leaf tissue

842
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,278
silicon

843
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,038
um so we looked at um which plant showed

844
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,000
a significant increase in their Leaf

845
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,838
silicon content once we added it um and

846
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,599
so interesting that petunia which had

847
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,679
such low levels of silicon whether it

848
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,720
was amended or not but if we did amend

849
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,838
it it absorbs something like 130% more

850
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,559
silicon than the than the unamended

851
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,759
soils so this was quite interesting we

852
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,239
measured several um morphological

853
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,159
parameters so simple things like just uh

854
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,878
flower diameter height of the plant stem

855
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,599
diameter um dry weight fresh weight and

856
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:38,960
so on and essentially found some very

857
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,119
subtle um differences nothing hugely

858
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,800
dramatic with silicon in some cases

859
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,200
there were statistically significant

860
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,720
differences where say flower diameter

861
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:52,078
was maybe 5% um wider when we had

862
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,678
silicon something like that um we also

863
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,480
found that cultivars within a species

864
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,880
can vary in their silicon accumulating

865
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,358
ability so we found like geranium for

866
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,200
example uh one cultivar that that

867
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,838
accumulated more silicon when we added

868
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,279
it and another that did not um and then

869
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,639
in the end what we found is that in the

870
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,880
absence of of stresses silicon did not

871
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,000
really have a dramatic effect on plant

872
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,280
growth um and about that time there was

873
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
this growing body of research that um

874
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,560
indeed most of the benefits of silicon

875
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,440
are when you have some um external

876
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,920
stress whether that be biotic or abiotic

877
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,960
uh so a postto that I had a few years

878
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,960
ago looked at the role of silicon in

879
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,280
poin Zia post Harvest performance and

880
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,159
poin Zia is the second largest um potted

881
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,720
crop in the US which was recently

882
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:41,000
overtaken by um phenopsis orchids uh or

883
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,598
just orchids in general uh a couple

884
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,559
years ago um and one of the things that

885
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,160
he did which I'm not going to really

886
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,159
show you is that he grew plants in the

887
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,440
greenhouse with different uh amounts of

888
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:56,279
irrigation water so 100% of their needs

889
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,039
80% of their needs or 60% of their needs

890
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,400
and um so of course if if you grow a

891
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:03,639
plant with less water um then it's

892
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,680
taking up you end up with a smaller

893
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:08,159
plant um and one of the things that he

894
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:11,078
found is that adding silicon in as

895
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,960
weekly drenches uh into these treatments

896
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,839
is that this reduction in say Leaf

897
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,838
surface area bra surface area when the

898
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:20,838
plant was only given 60% of its uh water

899
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,400
needs is that we saw some recovery in

900
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,480
the bra surface area and some recovery

901
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,599
of the leaf surface area when we added

902
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,519
silicon the other thing that we did is

903
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,559
we took these plants into again a

904
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,639
simulated retail environment so the post

905
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,199
Harvest environment um watered them once

906
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,519
and then didn't water them again and

907
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,719
looked at how long it took them to wilt

908
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,400
uh and we saw that the especially for

909
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,919
plants that received 100% of their

910
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,079
irrigation needs that if we added

911
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,680
silicon it took them longer to

912
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,519
wilt um and that's reflected here we

913
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:57,679
measured Leaf angle so a a larger Leaf

914
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,280
angle means a um you know more wilted

915
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,679
leaf a leaf closer to 90° would be a

916
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,200
completely wilted leaf and so

917
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,399
interesting that of the of the treatment

918
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,239
so plus am minus silicon in 60 80 or

919
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,838
100% of their irrigation needs the

920
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:16,399
plants that um had the lowest Leaf angle

921
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,078
were the Silicon uh treated plants and

922
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,358
the ones that had wilted the most was

923
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,318
especially the Silicon treated plant

924
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:24,960
that had gotten 100% or not silicon with

925
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:27,559
100% of its water

926
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,639
needs um we let the plants Wilt and then

927
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,279
then we rewatered them and we found

928
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:37,358
there was some uh qualitative benefit at

929
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:40,960
least uh to having silicon for Wilt to

930
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,880
recovery um my current postto Mikel moel

931
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,720
has looked more at silicon effects in

932
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,480
petunia um and a lot of the work I'm

933
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,118
going to talk about for the rest of the

934
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,800
time relates to petunia and we like

935
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,960
petunia because it's the largest um

936
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,560
bedding plant for wholesale value in the

937
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,480
US it's also been a genetic model

938
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:02,199
floriculture species for some 30 years

939
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,679
now and part of that has become because

940
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:06,279
it's relatively easy to transform is so

941
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,399
you can get transgenic plants and look

942
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,480
at the effects of genes it's decently

943
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,200
easy uh to handle in tissue culture and

944
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,280
so we found uh some work that Gonzalo

945
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,598
did in Hydroponics just like work that

946
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,680
he did in soil found reductions in

947
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,000
petunia growth with increasing um sodium

948
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,118
chloride salinity uh so we wanted to

949
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,719
know if silicon would improve petunia

950
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,760
salt tolerance and so Mel did uh

951
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,799
treatments with silicon at 02 or 4

952
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,440
Millar supplied as weekly drenches uh

953
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,920
evaluated the plants after 7 weeks and

954
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,318
they received a salt stress all along of

955
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Zer up to 80 Millar sodium chloride um

956
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:48,239
what she found is that the primary

957
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,839
effects on the plants were the salinity

958
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,559
effects so this this uh table doesn't

959
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:54,358
include silicon but you know something

960
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:58,199
like the shoot dry weight decreasing

961
00:38:54,358 --> 00:39:01,159
from 37 to 13 G

962
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,879
as sodium chloride increased and very

963
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:07,000
little kind of silicon interaction with

964
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,240
that uh when she looked a little deeper

965
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,639
though we could see kind of some very

966
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:15,199
subtle indications that silicon was

967
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:18,078
having benefits to the plant um and so

968
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:22,118
if we looked at Leaf area we have plants

969
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,160
that uh receive 0 two or four Millar

970
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,720
silicon and then the blue bars would be0

971
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:30,480
Millar sodium chloride up to purple

972
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,399
which would be 80 M sodium chloride and

973
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,358
so we found um in terms of statistical

974
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,480
significance um if we didn't have

975
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:41,000
silicon but we have that 80 Millar

976
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,480
sodium chloride um we saw a reduction in

977
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,960
leaf surface area um if we had silicon

978
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,639
either at 2 or four Millar that

979
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,280
statistical significance goes away so

980
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,118
there was a pattern of reduction but it

981
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,440
wasn't large enough to be statistically

982
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,440
significant in our experiment um we

983
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,039
measured chlorophyll index and the lower

984
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,240
leaves were interesting um with the

985
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:08,400
lower leaves we saw a reduction in uh

986
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:11,358
chlorophyll uh index uh when we didn't

987
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,720
have silicon at 80 mimar sodium chloride

988
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,440
but if you look at the 2 and 4 Millar

989
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,719
sodium chloride treatments we did not

990
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,240
see a significant uh reduction at all so

991
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,519
apparently helped to preserve the um the

992
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,838
Integrity of chlorophyll potentially

993
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:30,759
membrane Integrity in the plant Mel

994
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,039
wanted to know if this uh Will Carry On

995
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,319
Through To some of the photosynthetic

996
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,318
parameters um and so she looked at these

997
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,960
are plants treated with 80 Millar sodium

998
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,239
chloride and then they have silicon

999
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,599
supplemented at 02 and4

1000
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:48,039
Millar um and what she found is a

1001
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,160
pattern of of increased um net

1002
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,039
photosynthesis where we had

1003
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,358
silicon um however not statistically

1004
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,880
significant with transpiration or the

1005
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,639
rate of of water out of the leaves we

1006
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,000
saw a significant we saw a reduction but

1007
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,960
not significant but once she multiplied

1008
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,480
the two to get predicted water use

1009
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,559
efficiency that is the um you know the

1010
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,039
net um CO2 that's fixed per uh unit of

1011
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,920
water that's used uh when you combine

1012
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,639
the two we do get this statistically

1013
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,240
significant Trend that we have improved

1014
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,318
water use efficiency and so that's very

1015
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,639
much in line with the uh previous work

1016
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:29,159
that we had with like the drought

1017
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:31,920
tolerance in the poin Zia

1018
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,118
uh Mel has also exposed petunia to heat

1019
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,480
stress um and heat stress we see in the

1020
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,000
greenhouse we definitely see in the

1021
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,480
landscape especially in the southern

1022
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,440
half of the US uh she initially exposed

1023
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,519
uh petunia to 35° Cel or 40° Celsius

1024
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,920
continuously for either uh 24 hours 72

1025
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,800
hours and then after 72 hours pulling it

1026
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,318
out and looked at uh recovery and what

1027
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,240
we see is uh we have Wilt index here on

1028
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:01,559
the uh y AIS and then we have heat

1029
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,919
exposure and then the recovery period

1030
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,719
and we find that plants that the Silicon

1031
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,760
treated plants um after one day and then

1032
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,159
significant after 72 hours um and

1033
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,240
significant in the recovery period had

1034
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:19,000
significantly less Wilt uh than their

1035
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,959
control counterparts um and with 35° C

1036
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,599
we saw that Trend at

1037
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,639
72° um but or 72 hours but in the end

1038
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,720
was not a significant Trend by the time

1039
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,118
we got to

1040
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,480
recovery um in the picture here the left

1041
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,000
would be the Silicon treated plants at

1042
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,920
40° C for 3 days and the right would be

1043
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,440
the plants that do not get

1044
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,800
silicon uh she followed it up a little

1045
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,639
bit more so with uh with 40° celus

1046
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,599
plants she measured their Leaf

1047
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:50,719
temperature um prior to their stress and

1048
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,640
then 24 and 72 hours into the stress and

1049
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,799
she found a significant reduction in

1050
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,799
leaf temperature so maybe that relates

1051
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,318
to um she she watered the plants well

1052
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,160
through the the period but maybe they

1053
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:06,480
have some improved cooling capacity with

1054
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:10,000
the Silicon um and chlorophyll

1055
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,440
fluoresence or FV over FM a measure of

1056
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,838
uh efficiency of the photosynthetic

1057
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,760
apparatus uh we have plants on the left

1058
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:22,119
um those three different colored Bars

1059
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,400
were control two and four Millar silicon

1060
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:27,720
um before they got 40° cus stress and

1061
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,440
then after 2 days of that stress

1062
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:32,719
what we found is that the plants that

1063
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,480
didn't have silicon the controls um

1064
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:39,358
their efficiency was quite reduced where

1065
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,559
uh reductions were not uh so severe when

1066
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,639
they had two or four millimar silicon

1067
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,480
during the plant production

1068
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:49,118
phase okay so we can use you know

1069
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,159
existing compounds um whether they're

1070
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,280
beneficial nutrients or kelp extract or

1071
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:58,159
so on and improve uh stress tolerance I

1072
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,559
wanted to touch on a moment um

1073
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:04,519
uh molecular techniques to improve uh

1074
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,680
tolerance and uh the work that Mel's

1075
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:10,000
currently doing is in rice they know the

1076
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,358
two um carrier genes and the roots that

1077
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,199
are responsible for active silicon

1078
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:18,039
uptake um and so far those genes have

1079
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,960
mostly been found in gramineous species

1080
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,920
uh there's one case of a dcot where they

1081
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,119
found uh silicon uptake carrier and

1082
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,838
that's in um cucurbit which is about 1%

1083
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,559
by dry weight by comparison um you know

1084
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:34,440
rice was 5 or 10% silicone by dry weight

1085
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:37,480
petunia is about um 0

1086
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,039
2.05% by dry weight and so what mela's

1087
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,000
done is cloned these rice silicon

1088
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:43,920
Transporters um and we've generated

1089
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,480
transgenic patun lines with the

1090
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,240
transporter one or lsi1 and The

1091
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,159
Transporter 2 LSI 2 um and in and I'll

1092
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,399
talk in a minute about uh work that

1093
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,960
she's doing screening um you know if if

1094
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,920
a plant just has overexpressed l LS i1

1095
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,318
or just has overex expressed LSI 2 if

1096
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,559
there's a particular stress benefit the

1097
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,880
other thing that she's doing is now

1098
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,359
working on crosses of these plants to

1099
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,280
obtain u a homozygous line that has uh

1100
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,719
single transing copies of both of them

1101
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,559
so we can look at okay if you have the

1102
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,279
combination of the two carriers together

1103
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,960
does that give you a further

1104
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,040
enhancement um and okay so essentially

1105
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,280
Mel did qpcr and found that she had

1106
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,800
about a dozen lines each for LSI 1 and

1107
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,000
LSI 2 of plants that were enhanced in

1108
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,880
their relative

1109
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,239
expression um and the bars are kind of

1110
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,119
misleading so even like with lsi1 in

1111
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,719
this top graph here we have plants that

1112
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,280
have you know seven times the expression

1113
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:47,118
of actin all the way up to plants that

1114
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,440
have I don't know 9,000 20,000 times the

1115
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,318
um the expression as a housekeeping Gene

1116
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,838
um and a similar story for LSI 2 so

1117
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:58,159
anyways she was successful in in

1118
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,639
obtaining a rain of transgenic lines

1119
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:05,159
that varied in their expression levels

1120
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:07,879
uh for those lsi1 overexpressed plants

1121
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:11,838
um we grew them in a greenhouse with

1122
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,400
supplemental either uh 0.5 or 2 millimar

1123
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,599
silicon um and an interesting thing in

1124
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,200
some of the highly expressing lines at

1125
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,720
uh 2 millimar silicon we could see a bit

1126
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:27,679
of phytotoxicity if you see that leaf in

1127
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:31,118
the lower right um and yet if we look at

1128
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:33,118
the um the the Silicon content in the

1129
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,920
tissue we don't see a particular

1130
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,119
especially a 2 Millar silicon we don't

1131
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,240
see a significant difference in the

1132
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,119
Silicon content of those leaves as

1133
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:44,239
compared to a wild type plant so

1134
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,480
something may be related to the we use

1135
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,479
35s as the promoter for the gene not a

1136
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:54,719
root specific promoter um looking at the

1137
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,880
Silicon uh content we did see that um if

1138
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,199
for our transgenic plants um with no

1139
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,000
silicon amended at all they

1140
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:05,159
statistically had the same silicon

1141
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
content levels as um as a wild type

1142
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:13,358
plant with .5 Millar silicon and then uh

1143
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,039
transgenic plants with .5 Millar silicon

1144
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,279
um statistically had the same amount of

1145
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,639
silicon in them as a wild type plant uh

1146
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,040
with 2 millimar silicon so you know one

1147
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,279
potential benefit of these plants is

1148
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,920
they could be um better posed to

1149
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,040
scavenge the the silic that is existing

1150
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,599
in the soil and not having to apply

1151
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,519
exogenous silicon to obtain the same

1152
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,359
benefit um and she did she did screen

1153
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:42,000
five of the lines to uh heat

1154
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:44,199
stress um and she found that there was

1155
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,880
um significant um reduction in Wilt

1156
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:49,039
index for some of the lines um and she's

1157
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,720
just started now to look at some of the

1158
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,440
the explanations for that and she has

1159
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,799
shown uh for example a lower Leaf

1160
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,200
temperature um again for the transgenic

1161
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,800
lines even at Point 5 Millar silicon

1162
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:05,759
whereas for wild type plants um it took

1163
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,920
at least 2 Millar silicon to see those

1164
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,359
benefits uh I just wanted to point out

1165
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,318
Mel is collaborating with Dr Andre

1166
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:15,358
Kesler the ecology and evolutionary

1167
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,519
biology Department um and Mel has a

1168
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,679
background in in analyzing volatiles and

1169
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,480
plants and manipulating that process and

1170
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,118
they're looking at a cucumber um they're

1171
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,920
they're feeding it three different types

1172
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,680
of herbivores or they're giving it three

1173
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:33,159
types of herbivores and with or without

1174
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:35,399
silicon and then looking at um at uh you

1175
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:37,679
know a biver or damage to the leaf as

1176
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,800
well as some of the fingerprint of the

1177
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,679
volatile compounds that are given off um

1178
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,119
and that's very much in its preliminary

1179
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:47,960
stages and I wanted to mention my grad

1180
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,160
student Gonzalo is working on my PhD

1181
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,760
with me and one of the projects that

1182
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:55,039
he's looking at uh it's one of the

1183
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,920
chapters in his PhD is exploiting the

1184
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,000
trios Pathway to improve salt and

1185
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,838
drought tolerance of petunia so um this

1186
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,239
this is a pathway that's

1187
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:08,400
previously uh been used but um in the

1188
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:11,558
past so we have we have um some

1189
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,318
intermediates to trios which is a a

1190
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:16,798
sugar um and two of the potential

1191
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,759
bottlenecks um the enzymes that mediate

1192
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:21,759
those would be TPS and

1193
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:25,119
TPP um in the past uh people have looked

1194
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,079
at overexpressing uh TPS imp plants and

1195
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,920
they found an improved salt tolerance

1196
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,680
and drought tolerance and um what we

1197
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,280
want to do is look at okay is the

1198
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,558
combination of both required or can we

1199
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,119
get a more efficient response if they're

1200
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:41,760
both required or if we add them uh both

1201
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,798
together um and using petunia as our

1202
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,200
model species you know the petunia

1203
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:48,838
genome hasn't been sequenced yet um but

1204
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:51,879
using tomato as a reference genome Galo

1205
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,759
was able to clone TPS at tppp um

1206
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,440
successfully from petunia and sequenced

1207
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,280
them um and confirm their function in a

1208
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,920
ye

1209
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,079
uh system so that adds a bit to the our

1210
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:07,400
knowledge on petunia genes and so he's

1211
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:10,119
added those into the ncbi uh

1212
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,318
database so ultimately we're looking at

1213
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,039
does the expression of TPS and TPP

1214
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,519
improv salt and drought

1215
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:20,599
tolerance um do the either of the genes

1216
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,838
alone work or combined uh are they more

1217
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,200
efficient uh as well as there's this

1218
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:28,000
growing body of evidence that um the

1219
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,879
total am ount of treos that is

1220
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,239
accumulated isn't so important that it's

1221
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,480
acting more as a signaling molecule as

1222
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,519
opposed to in primitive plants um a

1223
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,400
large amount of trios can accumulate and

1224
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,920
there it's acting as an osmo protectant

1225
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,838
so we'd like to sort out okay are

1226
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,838
benefits related to more signaling or to

1227
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,880
um that osmo

1228
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,599
protection all right so with that I

1229
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,358
would just conclude by saying you know

1230
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,880
tackling these world problems uh

1231
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,920
resource shortages is going to take you

1232
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,000
know all of our combined efforts to do

1233
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,680
that and essentially this integrated

1234
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,599
approach of um there's room for people

1235
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:06,879
to look at production practices that use

1236
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,200
these resources efficiently uh we've

1237
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,440
talked about screening and other people

1238
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,039
abing breeding of plants that tolerate

1239
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,920
stress um exogenous compounds that we

1240
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,759
can use to enhance stress tolerance and

1241
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,880
then ultimately you know the uh these

1242
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,640
molecular approaches were are rewarding

1243
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,079
as

1244
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:28,558
well so thank you for your attention and

1245
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,559
I'll ask if there's any questions

1246
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:36,329
[Applause]

1247
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,679
yeah that's interesting and um I had

1248
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,839
thought one of my hypotheses was okay

1249
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:51,039
maybe uh for the Silicon benefit uh with

1250
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:53,119
um with a heat stress or Dr stress or

1251
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:56,838
cell stress something like that maybe it

1252
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,838
allows the the um plant to use uh water

1253
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:00,358
more efficiently and that that does seem

1254
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,679
to be the case but yet there's some

1255
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,558
underlying reason so you know there's

1256
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:06,039
less transpiration from the leaf surface

1257
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,798
you'd think there'd be less of a loss of

1258
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,279
that heat energy so it seems like

1259
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:12,599
there's some other mechanism that's

1260
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,920
taking place um and I don't have a great

1261
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,960
hypothesis for that I know that there

1262
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,639
was actually sort of a biophysicist

1263
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,559
looking at the problem and they found if

1264
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:23,400
there were a decent um cuticular

1265
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:26,119
deposits of silicon that they acted as

1266
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,680
kind of this heat sink of the leaf um

1267
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,720
and so in that case it was very much a

1268
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,838
physical kind of benefit of these

1269
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,118
cuticular deposits in the leaf um but

1270
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:37,199
that that I haven't looked at that at

1271
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,838
all for any of the the species that I've

1272
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,439
looked at with silicon so that's

1273
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,199
interesting the question is could some

1274
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,720
of the Silicon benefits be reflectant so

1275
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,798
if you have less energy being absorbed

1276
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:51,000
by the leaf that would account for that

1277
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:55,239
have you ever sort

1278
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,920
of meing refle yeah I think I I I would

1279
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,318
certainly follow through with that and

1280
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,680
I'm not familiar with literature looking

1281
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:03,400
at that um for plants that for

1282
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,639
graminaceous plants that accumulate a

1283
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,039
lot of silicon one of the benefits that

1284
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,118
they're talking about is a physical

1285
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,119
benefit of having a more upright plant

1286
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,280
that can sometimes intercept more light

1287
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,240
for photosynthesis but that would be you

1288
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,440
know that's a different kind of

1289
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,519
phenomenon but that just that

1290
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,599
reflectance itself would be interesting

1291
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,759
to

1292
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,760
pursue the question is do the plants

1293
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,920
look different uh for the from what I

1294
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,000
can tell from from Wild type plants that

1295
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,680
I've treated with silicon it's very hard

1296
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,559
I cannot really discern differences um

1297
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,879
with poinas I could find slightly

1298
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,200
thicker stems when they were treated

1299
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,880
with silicon it was interesting for me

1300
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:40,439
for um Mel one of the transgenic lines

1301
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,519
that she had that was that was highly

1302
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,599
expressing lsi1 we did see a more erect

1303
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:49,079
kind of petunia so it was the the wild

1304
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,440
type is more of the sprawling kind of

1305
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,960
petunia form and one of the transgenic

1306
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,079
lines was decently more erect which I

1307
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,280
would say had a firmer stem and a wider

1308
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,640
stem so in that case there was at least

1309
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,119
in this transgenic case a morphological

1310
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:05,639
difference and I would say probably rice

1311
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,400
starved of silicon compared to Rice

1312
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:09,440
given plenty of silicon you would see

1313
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,280
those type of differences and I would

1314
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,519
say the the reason we jump to treeos was

1315
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,480
we knew it had worked in the past in a

1316
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,920
rabid opsis I was interested in saying

1317
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,960
okay I'm a floriculturist but

1318
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,000
demonstrating that we can use molecular

1319
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,760
biology techniques in a floriculture

1320
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
crop um but then there are some

1321
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,640
interesting question questions related

1322
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
to the trios pathway that aren't

1323
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,239
answered even in a rabid opsis so that's

1324
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
something that we could potentially

1325
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:39,078
contribute to the literature um one of

1326
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,239
Gonzalez chapters is going to be um uh

1327
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:45,160
alumina hrus sequencing of patunas um

1328
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,919
with and without salt stress for varing

1329
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:48,639
lengths of time and so that would be

1330
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,760
very much like what you're talking about

1331
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,598
where uh looking at the existing body um

1332
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,440
and seeing which which genes are highly

1333
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,480
involved in say salt tolerance if that's

1334
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,159
our so so yeah we'll get there Peter

1335
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,318
yeah and so in that sense realizing that

1336
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,118
the toolkit that we have with a rabid

1337
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,679
opsis with with uh Knockouts that exist

1338
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,640
and the you know our genome that has

1339
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,318
been fully sequenced and so on will help

1340
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:14,719
us move forward to answer those

1341
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:17,599
questions um more directly

1342
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,358
right oh that's a great question Galo

1343
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,720
and I talk about that a lot whether

1344
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,279
transgenic floriculture crops might be

1345
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:26,919
more accepted by the public than

1346
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,720
transgenic food crops um and

1347
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,318
I don't know the answer to that I was

1348
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,038
talking with I was at a conference in

1349
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,000
the Netherlands a couple weeks ago and

1350
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,960
some colleagues there were saying that

1351
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,119
the public there is quite resistant to

1352
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,760
GMOs and what other whatever whether

1353
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,440
they eat it or not um yet in Japan we

1354
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:48,720
have the first case of a transgenic

1355
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,039
flower so-called blue rose that um that

1356
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,679
is now uh licensed there on the market

1357
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:56,559
and that is apparently available in the

1358
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:58,519
US now although I've never seen them um

1359
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,640
ultimately you know if you want to get a

1360
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:02,838
transgenic crop you're going to have to

1361
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,358
spend something what was it several

1362
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:06,558
hundred million dollars Peter would have

1363
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:10,279
answers to that you know to go through

1364
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:13,240
the the Hoops of showing this is a safe

1365
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:17,000
uh plant to use and it's given case and

1366
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:19,279
that the uh and so on and so the those

1367
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,559
obstacles if you look at floriculture

1368
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,720
crops compared to like corn you know

1369
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:26,039
petunia which is the the largest value

1370
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,759
bedding plant is worth $200 million a

1371
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:29,200
year

1372
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,640
so no one's going to spend $100 million

1373
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,399
in hoops in trying to get a transgenic

1374
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:36,199
uh petunia feeding trial yeah at least

1375
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,358
we don't have to do feeding trials but

1376
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:39,719
you know we'd still have to do like

1377
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,239
pollinator trials and then okay are

1378
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:42,798
there patunas in the landscape that the

1379
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:47,000
gene could spread to and do you need

1380
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:49,400
male sterility things like that so uh

1381
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,400
ultimately it's a ways off I think if we

1382
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,960
ever get to a more streamline um

1383
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,920
procedure where they said okay if you're

1384
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,798
a floriculture crop not a food crop um

1385
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
you only have to pass through these

1386
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:04,679
hurdles um and made that more efficient

1387
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:04,679
I think I think we could get

1388
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
there all right Neil thank you very

1389
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,359
