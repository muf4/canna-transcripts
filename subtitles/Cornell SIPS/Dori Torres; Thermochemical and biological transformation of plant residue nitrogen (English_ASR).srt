1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,359
University as johannas mentioned I've

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,678
been here for five years doing my PhD

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,519
and um this is sort of the culmination

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,600
of those five years and for the last

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,278
five years I've been working in looking

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,840
at biochar systems specifically at um

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:30,518
small cook Stow systems um in Kenya and

9
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,558
more specifically in this talk I'm going

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:36,079
to be talking about what happens to the

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,280
carbon and nitrogen within those systems

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,960
so just to give you a brief um look at

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,198
what I I've been doing um this is how

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,878
typically a cook stove system or

15
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,280
household Energy System can look in

16
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,280
Kenya where I've been working where we

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,480
have a traditional stove there is a lot

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,000
of wood Gathering From the trees to

19
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,038
combust in an O three stone fire which

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,039
is totally open air and there is a lot

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,599
of greenhouse gases and air pollutants

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,680
that are constantly going and being

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,919
emitted into the environment however if

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,280
we were to introduce a biochar cook

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
stove or I might actually call it a

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,920
pyrolysis stove throughout the course of

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,400
the talk um this system might look

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,040
totally different one of the main things

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,000
of this system is that um we are now

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,880
using um biomass residues or plant

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,599
residues and these are being used in

32
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,599
this pyrolysis stove um which I'll later

33
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,719
go into explaining how it works and it

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,640
still emits greenhouse gases and air

35
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,840
pollutants but those are going to be a

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,040
lot less and in this talk I'm going to

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,920
be um looking at um um nitrogen and

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
carbon

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
emissions um now you would ask well

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,040
where is this feed stock coming well

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,600
that's the chapter I'm not talking about

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,920
um today this is part of the the the

43
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,959
Dynamics that I look at but I'm not

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
going to be talking about today so today

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,359
I'll be talking about the biochar

46
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,679
production

47
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,200
with the stoves and then afterwards once

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,280
you have that biochar what happens to

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,640
the biochar when you actually want to

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,959
use it and put it back into soil and

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,759
what I'm going to be specifically

52
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,439
looking at is what happens to that

53
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,719
nitrogen in the plant residues um that

54
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,878
was not emitted into the air but

55
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:27,919
remained in the

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:32,000
biochar so to do this um I actually um

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:35,359
have a series of things that did and we

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,719
start with the initial residue n um and

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,159
we pyed these plant residues and I'm

60
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:44,639
going to be looking at the gashes CNN

61
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:51,318
losses um thereafter I took the biochar

62
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:53,639
and I um characterized it and

63
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:58,199
um we we realized that there was a

64
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,318
biochar enrichment and and and there was

65
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,359
and we want to look at how why there was

66
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:06,439
a uh a a nitrogen enrichment in the

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,640
biochar um we also look at different

68
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,799
parts of the biochar we actually

69
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,839
fractionated the biochar we extracted

70
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,680
some components from it and so we ended

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,759
up with some volatiles or what we call

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,840
volatiles but they're tan extracted

73
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:23,519
volatiles so take that in mind and then

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,039
we remained with also the extracted

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,879
biochar we wanted to see how those look

76
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,120
and finally in an incubation experiment

77
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,158
I look at the stability of it I look at

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,878
what happens to the carbon and nitrogen

79
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,400
how does the nitrogen actually affect

80
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,560
the carbon

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,480
stability um so just again um a little

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
bit uh of of the three things that I'm

83
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,639
going to talk about the influence of

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,238
small pyrolysis cook stoves um systems

85
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,039
on on gaseous C and N emissions the

86
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,840
characterization of the organic nitrogen

87
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,919
in biochar and the nitrogen's um role on

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,680
BioTrust

89
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:03,078
stability so moving right along let's

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,239
look at what happens when you have um a

91
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,079
a system where you have introduced a a a

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,360
biochar stove or a paralysis stove and

93
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,840
as you can see here we have this woman

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,159
that I actually did some research with

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
in Kenya and she's using one of our

96
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,879
stoves um to cook and and we are

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,280
actually measuring the emissions um that

98
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,439
are coming out of the

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,519
stove so the main thing to remember here

100
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,399
is that when you actually have the

101
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,399
original system the three F the three

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,038
stor fire there is carbon and nitrogen

103
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,439
oxidation and generally speaking what

104
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,399
happens is that there's not enough

105
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,839
oxygen in this process um to combust

106
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,399
fully the carbon and so what happens is

107
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,079
you have a lack of sto stoat air um

108
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,279
incomplete combustion and you have a lot

109
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:53,198
of carbon monoxide coming out um what

110
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,399
the features of of of the system or of

111
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,400
the stove actually affect is the amount

112
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,120
of oxygen the mixing of the oxygen with

113
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,599
the gases and also the time temper of

114
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,120
combustion actually affects those things

115
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,479
and then in nitrogen oxidation there

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,720
those things also happen um the um

117
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:17,199
oxygen mixing and temperature are part

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,600
of um the the variables that affect n no

119
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
emissions but more specifically we

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,280
wanted to look at what happens with the

121
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,679
nitrogen in the biomass what actually is

122
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,918
the effect of the nitrogen in the

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,478
biomass in the subsequent emissions that

124
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,240
we're going to see from the stove um and

125
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,120
in this specific case what we're looking

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,800
for is the still this geometry but also

127
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,840
the fuel con the fuel and

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,600
concentration um and why do we care like

129
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,198
why why would we even care to look at

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,639
these things well

131
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,639
from from from a from a climate change

132
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,918
perspective we all know emissions are

133
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,600
bad you know they affect um the

134
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,839
greenhouse gases in the environment but

135
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,439
I think that more importantly there's

136
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,159
actually an aspect to this which is

137
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:11,719
human health which is which Co actually

138
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,439
leads to 3.5 or sorry not Co indoor air

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,400
pollution actually which includes Co

140
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,120
leads to 3.5 million deaths worldwide

141
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,279
each year and that's actually a really

142
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,000
big deal so if you want to look at the

143
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,799
bigger picture that is why we're also

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,120
like trying to see how you can change

145
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,840
the Dynamics from combustion um to maybe

146
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,439
introducing a paralysis doove and see

147
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:39,879
what happens and also Africa in general

148
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:43,240
has 20% Global emissions of Co and nox

149
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,038
and now more importantly as wood um

150
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,000
stocks actually diminish in a lot of

151
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,000
these parts more and more people are

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,959
using higher nitrogen content plant

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,319
residues for cooking and that actually

154
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,758
has also some um implications in

155
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
emissions so our main objectives

156
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,720
initially were to measure the overall

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,240
performance of a paralysis cook stove

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
and compare those to the international

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,598
um standard organization cook stove

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,960
parameters um and also to understand the

161
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:14,680
mechanisms by which Co and no emissions

162
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:18,680
are formed in the paralysis stove and to

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,680
do this we designed a stove um which I

164
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,598
didn't um some um originally a an

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,160
engineer from um India did and we've

166
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,319
we've taken this this this um design um

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,039
on and and improved it from my masters

168
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,720
onto my dissertation and mechanical

169
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,959
engineers have worked with us for that

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
um but just to give you a little uh

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,878
brief uh brief

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,560
explanation inside here is actually a

173
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
pyrolysis chamber and this is the

174
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,800
pyrolysis chamber right over here where

175
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,959
you actually would put biomass and that

176
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
pyrolysis chamber is partially sealed so

177
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,758
it does not see as much it does not

178
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
actually have access to as much oxygen

179
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,800
and then in the middle over here we

180
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,360
actually have a combustion chamber which

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,520
you still have to feed some wood into

182
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,800
and the um the combustion chamber

183
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,120
actually is what generates the initial

184
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,400
heat both for the cooking and also for

185
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,759
the paralysis of the biomass however as

186
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,839
this biomass in the pyrolysis chamber

187
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,199
starts devolatilizing the gases come

188
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,279
into the combustion chamber and are

189
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:32,399
ignited so what happens is you kind of

190
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:35,399
switch over into using more of the fuel

191
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,879
from the from the volatiles that are

192
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,879
coming out from the pyrolysis chamber

193
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,120
and consequently what happens is you

194
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:46,360
have both the wood and the volatiles or

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,879
the gas from the pyrolysis forming part

196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,519
of the flame that actually is um

197
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,838
generating heat for cooking um we

198
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,720
measured these emissions and the

199
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,079
performance of the stove in our lab um

200
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,519
just so we could have a standardized way

201
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:09,278
of comparing our stove to other stoves

202
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,839
in in that that are that are potentially

203
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,480
um available to make biochar as well and

204
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,800
this is our this is our system we have a

205
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,639
hood that was designed I bu some

206
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:24,559
students and we have the the the stove

207
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:27,879
in there um we use two different types

208
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,399
of biomass um to represent high and low

209
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:34,320
nitrogen um switch Gra pellets to be the

210
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,078
high nitrogen and hardwood pallets um to

211
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,240
be the low nitrogen uh content and we

212
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:42,278
use pellets just to keep the uniformity

213
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,519
of the of the of the biomass and not

214
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:47,759
introduce that as a variable um we did a

215
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,759
water boiling test which is sort of a

216
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,480
traditional way of measuring the

217
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,039
efficiency of or the performance of

218
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,600
stoves and basically what you do is you

219
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:59,399
boil water that is it but what you do is

220
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,000
while you're boiling water a specific

221
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,240
amount of water you are actually

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,839
measuring emissions temperature fuel use

223
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,919
and so on and so forth however this

224
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,399
stove um perform um operates a little

225
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,000
bit differently than your regular

226
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:18,679
combustion stove and we had to actually

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,120
to modify the the the original um test

228
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,078
and the only difference is that

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,720
generally you extinguish the this the

230
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,719
stove halfway once the the water boils

231
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
and in this case we did not in this case

232
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,120
we just Contin Contin to change um the

233
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,480
pots of water till the pyrolysis had

234
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,799
actually um been done so like till all

235
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,680
the fuel was used um and we were able to

236
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,679
measure real-time pyrolysis fuel loss

237
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,000
and fuel consumption and when I say fuel

238
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:52,159
consumption I'm referring to Wood fuel

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,759
consumption and we were measuring with a

240
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,559
real time um real time instantane or

241
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,278
instantaneous um gas emissions with a

242
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,799
gas analyzer herba to PG

243
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,480
250

244
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,199
um and right into the results so what

245
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm going to show you first is what

246
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,079
traditionally everybody shows you I have

247
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,319
my stove in this case it's the pyrolysis

248
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,759
stove these are wood or wood pellets the

249
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,160
wood the wp is wood pellets and these

250
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,759
are three metrics that are not normally

251
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,879
used to measure what happens with

252
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,679
overall stove performance specifically

253
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:36,399
this one has to do with with um sort of

254
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:41,039
energy use um so it's co G per megga of

255
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,639
dry fuel used um Co in grams per minute

256
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,199
that's a rate of grams of of amount of

257
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,039
Co emitted and that's actually used as

258
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,200
an indicator for health and then the

259
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,199
modifi combustion efficiency which is

260
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,639
actually used to determine whether your

261
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,639
stove is actually combusting properly

262
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,879
the products that um the gases products

263
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,799
so if you have a high combustion

264
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,278
efficiency see your stove is performing

265
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,559
fairly well um and as you can see here's

266
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:10,399
the three stone fire the pyrolysis stove

267
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:13,159
of our study and then these are all

268
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,039
similar stoves in terms of what they

269
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:19,198
claim to do so some of them perform

270
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,240
these are more gasifiers but they do

271
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:25,240
claim to make biochar and they do they

272
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,240
do tend to operate in similar fashion so

273
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,759
we decided to compare them and the tier

274
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,079
ranking here

275
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:36,078
is um the standards the is the ISO

276
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,039
standards that I talked about where

277
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,799
basically they have set some standards

278
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,879
to see if your stove is performing

279
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:45,159
properly or not one being a poor

280
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,240
performance and four being the most

281
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:51,278
Optimum performance and for each of

282
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,919
these there might be individual rankings

283
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,799
so you you actually rank them

284
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,599
individually and tier one for Co it's

285
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:02,159
above 097 Grand per minute and tier four

286
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,800
is um less than 42 grams per minute and

287
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,639
as you can see fortunately enough our

288
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:11,719
stove actually performs fairly well in

289
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:14,278
that area and it also when compared to

290
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,560
um the three stone fire although it

291
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,600
doesn't perform as well as the stove

292
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,319
Tech teide which is actually the highest

293
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,440
performing stove that is out there right

294
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,440
now in terms of um emissions and that

295
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,800
also can actually um make paralysis but

296
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,040
you can see that we're actually in a

297
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,000
Range that is favorable for us and

298
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,679
that's great that's actually a really

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,839
good deal and then as far as nitrogen

300
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,759
because I said I was going to talk about

301
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:46,199
nitrogen too um we want to look at the

302
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,600
overall no emissions that we um got from

303
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:49,919
the stove and in this particular case

304
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,759
there isn't a lot of studies that

305
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,240
actually look at nitrogen emissions or

306
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,000
no emissions um from stoves because they

307
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,000
don't deem them as important as they are

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,720
and I don't have anything to compare

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
immediately but here what we wanted to

310
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,519
show is that as you have more nitrogen

311
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,240
in the fuel so in the x axis we have

312
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,320
nitrogen and in the content and in the y

313
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,839
axis we have n o you can see that as you

314
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,800
have more nitrogen you have more no

315
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,320
Evolution from the stove and so that was

316
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:25,039
sort of a given to us that that might

317
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,079
happen but there was a problem we we

318
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,078
weren't satisfied with those results so

319
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,799
you tell people great my stove performs

320
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,719
properly but what does that mean what

321
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,000
does that actually mean for the person

322
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,399
that's using the stove what does that

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,720
mean really in the context of how things

324
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,360
are evolving within the stove so then we

325
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,920
looked at answering two more questions

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,560
what are the key processes affecting the

327
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,838
formation of Co and no emissions in the

328
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,479
pyrolysis stove and we hypothesized that

329
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,160
there were the rate of fuel consumption

330
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,839
would consumption the rate of pyrolysis

331
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,480
fuel consumption and also the

332
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,759
temperature and that they would all be

333
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,240
positive Co correlated with um Co and no

334
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,159
emissions and the higher the nitrogen

335
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,278
imp plant residues it would lead to more

336
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,759
no production the other thing that we

337
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,679
wanted to look is well how does

338
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,600
paralysis affect the partitioning of N

339
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,719
and so we thought that most of it would

340
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,879
actually be going into the gas and I'm

341
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,600
going to show the results of that so in

342
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,240
order to actually look at the Dynamics

343
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,560
of what's happening with the emissions

344
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,519
you actually need to look at the

345
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,719
instantaneous emissions because that's

346
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,318
really what's meaningful here

347
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,240
and I'm if you look at over here in this

348
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:38,719
chart to the right hand side we have

349
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,440
time in the x-axis and N in grams per

350
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,560
second so the rate of production of

351
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:47,880
nitrogen um oxide you can see that the

352
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,518
higher the nitrogen you have the higher

353
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,519
the N you have so that sort of tells us

354
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,440
you know the same thing the same picture

355
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,000
as the prior um graph that I showed

356
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,519
you however when you look at Co which

357
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,679
looks so good in that table that we were

358
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,839
looking when you look at the peak levels

359
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:11,120
of Co in this graph this is 3.62 grams

360
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,759
per minute at the highest and over here

361
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,639
at the second highest maybe or around

362
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,440
there or the second Peak um um it's 2.1

363
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,759
grams per minute and what this means is

364
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,560
that we're actually um quite higher on

365
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,199
the the Dynamics of the co for um

366
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,879
evolving from the stove is actually high

367
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,958
and that actually has implications for

368
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,679
for exposures to human health people

369
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,239
that are exposed to that level of Co at

370
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,039
one particular time it actually can have

371
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,278
consequences on them so these are the

372
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,318
things that we want to look at

373
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,799
instantaneous emissions to be able to um

374
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:48,719
remediate later

375
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:50,159
on um now we wanted to also look at what

376
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,360
parameters of the stove or what

377
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,360
parameters of the chemistry um that were

378
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,879
happening inside the stove actually um

379
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,720
predicted these two variables so the

380
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,318
rate of production of o and n o and what

381
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,759
we actually found out is that the rate

382
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:09,078
of fuel consumption of the pyrolysis um

383
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:13,119
um fuel was actually

384
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:15,959
predominantly um uh

385
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,918
um influencing what was happening the

386
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,679
two emissions so here um overwhelming

387
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,640
overwhelmingly um C uh pyrolysis rate

388
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,160
was

389
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
actually um so fast that it doesn't

390
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,360
allow for proper mixing with the oxygen

391
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
and combustion of the co so then you

392
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,759
have a lot of Co forming and wood has

393
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,279
some contribution to that as well and

394
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:42,240
then when you look at the nitrogen

395
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,480
emissions um instead of being only the

396
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,400
nitrogen content it's actually the rate

397
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,038
at which the nitrogen is evolving

398
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,440
through the course of pyrolysis that

399
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:53,079
actually matters and also the

400
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,798
temperature at which the pyrolysis is

401
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,599
happening is is influencing the rate at

402
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,599
which the nitrogen is coming out of that

403
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,918
stove so that's really important because

404
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,319
those parameters are then later used to

405
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,360
go back and redesign or fix some things

406
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,558
of the stove that we would need to so we

407
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,599
can address these

408
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:16,240
situations um and

409
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:19,639
finally um we wanted to see well so we

410
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,120
know that we have an O coming out of the

411
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,880
of the of the stove but we also want to

412
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:27,279
know what proportion of that nitrogen

413
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,840
that's coming out is actually no o or

414
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,678
other species and and um these are the

415
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,158
three fuels that I actually used and I

416
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,919
know that I mentioned two before but we

417
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,679
had two of them that were um slightly

418
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,080
different in nitrogen of the hard woods

419
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,960
so we separated those and then here we

420
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,918
have fraction of the total nitrogen that

421
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,600
went actually into the stove and so

422
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,038
overwhelmingly the majority of the of

423
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:57,678
the of the nitrogen actually remains in

424
00:18:52,038 --> 00:19:00,038
the Char and so um about 50% of it

425
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,000
remains in the Char and 10% of it is

426
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,599
only no the only issue is that we didn't

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
measure all the nitrogen species that

428
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,279
could be coming out of the out of the

429
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,640
stove so this is the other nend species

430
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,798
and that also accounts for about 40% of

431
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,559
the nitrogen so if we want to know the

432
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,200
overall n nitrogen budget we would have

433
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,759
to go back and measure those but for

434
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,440
this study we were measuring no o um and

435
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,240
so moving forward we once we have this

436
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,558
nitrogen in the biochar we want to see

437
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,319
well what does that mean why did it

438
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,359
remain there and to do so we actually

439
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,519
decided to look

440
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,918
at the forms of nitrogen that were

441
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:46,599
actually in the original biomass in the

442
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,240
biochar and look at the nitrogen um and

443
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,000
how it was formed with different

444
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,759
pyrolysis temperatures so we did this

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,200
using nitrogen kedge um NEX has

446
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,359
spectoscopy

447
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,880
and there were some interesting findings

448
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,639
um now why did we also do this it's

449
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,360
because like I said we we found that a

450
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,960
lot of the nitrogen was remaining in the

451
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,279
biochar so why is why is all that

452
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,400
nitrogen remaining and one of the things

453
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,399
is that one of the theories that we have

454
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,159
is that it's being incorporated into

455
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,360
heter istic like um compounds and a lot

456
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,159
of people have also said that that could

457
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:31,000
be true but um not they haven't really

458
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,960
been able to parcel out exactly what

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,960
kind of nitrogen and what the formation

460
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,960
of that nitrogen is with

461
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:44,360
temperature um so this is like I said

462
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:47,360
like the this is what led us to to look

463
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,959
at what type of what type of um Dynamics

464
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,519
was happening with the nitrogen in the

465
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,558
biochar because as temperature increases

466
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:57,918
we have a a enrichment of that nitrogen

467
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,918
and there's a Tipping Point after 350 in

468
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,679
this particular case we see that the

469
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,880
amount of nitrogen in the biochar is

470
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,320
actually diminishing but there's another

471
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,320
interesting qu um thing here and it's

472
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,759
that when you look at the low nitrogen

473
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,759
there is actually a much steeper um

474
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,400
enrichment there's a lot larger

475
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,359
enrichment in nitrogen um low nitrogen

476
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,200
containing biomass than there would be

477
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,918
if you had high nitrogen containing the

478
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,200
IMs so that actually led to

479
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,600
hypothesizing what could be happening

480
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,278
with the original nitrogen in the

481
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:37,359
biomass and so if we start with some

482
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:39,558
very nicely easily aliphatic um

483
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:43,158
compounds of nitrogen and then we

484
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,918
subject it to um higher temperatures

485
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,360
what we start seeing is that there are

486
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,679
either condensation there is lost of

487
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:55,599
water there is formation of cyclic rings

488
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,200
and so on and so forth as as carbon is

489
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,558
lost nitrogen gets more and more um

490
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,360
aromatic or

491
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,359
recalcitrant um and in this case it's a

492
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,959
little bit different it's more the

493
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,719
removal well it's also the removal of

494
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,440
water and and Co but oxygen being

495
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,960
removed can be can lead

496
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,759
to

497
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,240
uh aromatic nitrogen or um triple Bonds

498
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:28,319
in Nitro which are also very strong

499
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,440
bonds and so in order to um given this

500
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,119
we we decided to look at the following

501
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,759
questions and we decided to look at how

502
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,319
does pyrolysis temperature actually

503
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,440
affect the different forms of nitrogen

504
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,038
being formed and with increasing

505
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,440
paralysis temperature it will lead more

506
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:45,879
to to more stable forms of nitrogen so

507
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,919
stable I mean aromatic um and we had

508
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,480
another question which is can the amount

509
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,799
of nitrogen actually um in the biomass

510
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,360
lead to more formation of heterocycles

511
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:58,599
and the hypothesis being that increasing

512
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,639
amounts of nitrogen can lead to to more

513
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:05,038
and more um heterocycle aromatic

514
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,278
nitrogen um to do this study I grew

515
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,200
biomass at different levels of nitrogen

516
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,159
so everything was the same except the

517
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,840
nitrogen that we were actually um

518
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:19,200
fertilizing with we did uh Woody biomass

519
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:22,240
uh crop residue and grass and we pyed

520
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,679
them at three different temperatures 350

521
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,798
5700 and like as I mentioned before I

522
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,000
did a socks construction um to remove

523
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,558
the with holline to remove the

524
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,319
condensible

525
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,480
volatiles um we went to CLS which was

526
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:41,359
really cool and I totally geeked out and

527
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:45,159
use the syncron over there and um we so

528
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,000
this is um nitrogen um x-ray nitrogen

529
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,080
spectroscopy and what you need to take

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,720
away from this through the rest of when

531
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,480
I carry when I talk about my data is

532
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,038
that the energy level of the absorbing

533
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,480
atom actually decreases or increases

534
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,960
depending on the atoms that are adjacent

535
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,440
to it so whether it's carbon the

536
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,360
nitrogen uh the energy level decreases

537
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,240
if it's oxygen the uh energy level

538
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,719
increases and that should be sort of the

539
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,440
the way that I'm going to be explaining

540
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,519
what happened um and so this is one of

541
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,640
the many graphs that I have of the of my

542
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,158
of my um data but these are maze leaves

543
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,038
and these are low nitrogen I actually

544
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,080
have the pair of each of these which is

545
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,960
high nitrogen but you can't really see a

546
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,439
different in the squiggly lines and what

547
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,440
you're going to see here is all the

548
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,798
materials these are the the plant

549
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,480
residues the biochar and the

550
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:45,240
volatiles and first and foremost I'm

551
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,319
going to talk about the plant residues

552
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,240
and just so you know I didn't just like

553
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,558
make these up I actually de convoluted

554
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,798
those so I went through a very rigorous

555
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,519
process of two years of deconvoluting my

556
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:01,119
Spectra and this is what I have come out

557
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:04,480
with and what you need to look at is

558
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:08,359
that in biomass specifically which we're

559
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,200
looking at here the majority of this um

560
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:14,599
biomass it's actually aromatic um five

561
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,600
membered rings whether it's in whether

562
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,959
it has one or two nitrogens and this was

563
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
sort of surprising because the majority

564
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,880
of the people predict that it's amino

565
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,880
acids proteins well guess what amino

566
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,880
acids and proteins have heterocyclic

567
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:33,080
nitrogen so us finding this

568
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:38,000
actually is not that um

569
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:41,119
surprising um but overwhelmingly 50% of

570
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,599
biomass is actually um five membered

571
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,319
rings and probably due to some amino

572
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:49,678
acids that are constituents of the

573
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,158
biomass um now when we look at the

574
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,360
biochar what you're going to see is that

575
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,159
there has been a shift of energy so this

576
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:00,119
was the main peak in the biochar this in

577
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,679
the biomass this 401 .41 and as you can

578
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,759
see there's nothing there anymore but

579
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,759
now we have a new Peak at

580
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:17,278
398.36 membered rings and so not only do

581
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,200
we have this new Peak but as we move um

582
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,440
in increasing temperature which is

583
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,120
happening here we actually have a shift

584
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,320
to a lower um energy level so there's

585
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,678
more carbon surrounding that nitrogen um

586
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,839
atom those absorbing atoms most likely

587
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,000
so that was also very interesting and

588
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,480
not only that but we were also we

589
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,480
identified a nitrogen form that wasn't

590
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,919
quite or a nitrogen Peak specifically an

591
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,000
energy um that

592
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,240
wasn't explained in the literature

593
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,558
before so we are treating that guy as

594
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,880
sort of a little bit different because

595
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:55,558
it hasn't been described before so it

596
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,760
tends to to follow the the the trend

597
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:01,480
with biochar and pyrolysis temperature

598
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,759
and then finally when we look at um the

599
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,720
volatiles which are these and these are

600
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,519
volatiles and increasing temperature as

601
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,120
well so these are what we extracted from

602
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,200
the original biochar we see that that

603
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,839
398 Peak doesn't actually exist there

604
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,080
however we actually have this little

605
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:22,720
Peak over here which I didn't um um

606
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:25,879
label but it's at 4.74 which is actually

607
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,759
a cyclic um nitrogen and that cyclic

608
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,919
nitrogen tends to be very

609
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,599
um

610
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:38,360
um dis it actually it it's very common

611
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:40,480
for as a byproduct of paralysis um of

612
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:45,079
volatiles in the literature it's been

613
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,960
described as a byproduct for um um break

614
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:50,319
breakdowns of volatiles so it's actually

615
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,919
a distinctive from the biart and from

616
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,480
the boms so that is allowed us to

617
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,880
identify these different um components

618
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,720
of the biochar and in like I said in

619
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,240
this case

620
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,519
cyclic is one of the one of the um forms

621
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,919
of nitrogen that shows up but

622
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,880
overwhelmingly again the aromatic five

623
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:12,278
ring is what actually predominates in

624
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,679
the in the biomass in the volatiles

625
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,640
sorry um

626
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,240
so what does that all mean so what we

627
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,360
wanted to look at is who is being

628
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,440
affected or what is being affected with

629
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,639
um temperature and here in the in the

630
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,200
x-axis I have temperature and in the y

631
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,679
axis I have um two different functional

632
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,399
groups or what we are calling two

633
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,320
different functional groups in this case

634
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,239
the aromatic Six Ring um nitrogen and

635
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,918
that's percent of total that's that one

636
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,720
nitrogen um energy resonance level that

637
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,679
I've told you that hasn't described and

638
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
these are all the other aromatic

639
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,200
six-membered rings that um functional

640
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,319
groups and what we're seeing is that

641
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,399
with increasing temperature we actually

642
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,798
have an aold increase of that particular

643
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,678
nitrogen that um that we were looking at

644
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,558
that's six member ring and in the other

645
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,320
case what's happening is that all the

646
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,079
other um six-membered rings are actually

647
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,480
decreasing and they decrease by

648
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,038
half

649
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
now

650
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:16,919
um we also wanted to look at we we we

651
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,879
also looked at what happened with the

652
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,440
nitrogen level and fortunately enough we

653
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,080
actually found as well that as nitrogen

654
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,640
content increase which is in the x- axis

655
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:31,199
the total aromatic or the total heteros

656
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,038
in the chart actually increase and this

657
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,360
actually made sense because if you have

658
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,440
more nitrogen then you actually can

659
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,158
overcome that activation energy that you

660
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
need to make another to to make a bond

661
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
that's a lot stronger so you satisfy the

662
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,959
easier bonds and then you proceed to

663
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:49,798
make like a lot um harder bonds or bonds

664
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,038
that are more energetically

665
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,839
um uh that are that they require more

666
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,119
energy and on the other hand if you

667
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:02,879
actually have more nitrogen then easier

668
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,439
Bond um um or nitrogen bonded to

669
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,960
aromatics which are nitrogen which is

670
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,840
out of a cyclic ring then actually

671
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,319
diminish and that also makes

672
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,359
sense because of the same reason you

673
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,200
actually satisfy the amount of um

674
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,759
nitrogens that you can actually um

675
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,360
um uh nitrogen bonds that you can make

676
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,038
and then thereafter you cannot make

677
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,319
anymore so that was actually really

678
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,278
interesting because this is only

679
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,038
described in the literature once um

680
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:32,038
prior and it was a long time ago so this

681
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:34,440
is really cool to see again um so now

682
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,919
finally really

683
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,278
quick why do we care about the form of

684
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,679
nitrogen and so that leads to the last

685
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:49,000
part of my of my dissertation and it's

686
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,200
because we hypothesize that um if you

687
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,798
have more

688
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,360
nitrogen um then maybe the nitrogen is

689
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,359
actually maybe that makes um biochar

690
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:05,000
less stable but is it really and so we

691
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:08,038
all know that CN is used as a measure of

692
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,558
um of for biomass decomposing but is it

693
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,759
actually something that we can use for

694
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:16,720
biochar as well is it a metric that's

695
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:19,519
useful and um our hypothesis is that no

696
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,798
that it's not it is not a useful metric

697
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,000
um to measure the stability of of n of

698
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,440
biochar specifically um we actually

699
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,200
looked at what is the stability uh the

700
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,919
the Char look like does it increase or

701
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,720
decrease with nitrogen and also do any

702
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,679
of these forms of nitrogen that I just

703
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,558
talked about actually are responsible

704
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,000
for comparing some of the stability to

705
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:43,240
the

706
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,679
biochar and for that I did a

707
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,798
mineralization study with biochar only

708
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:52,200
and sand only um I took two of the

709
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,879
biochars and the plant residues um

710
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,960
without charring and I incubated those

711
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,278
at 30 um degrees C and I measured

712
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,519
respiration rates for CO2 and nitrogen

713
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:10,398
mineralization um for a very very long

714
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,038
time 200 days or so and this is what um

715
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,918
the resulting um cumulative

716
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,278
mineralization was in the upper graph we

717
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,360
have just the biomass in low nitrogen

718
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,240
and light n High nitrogen and when I

719
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,398
talk about low nitrogen think

720
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,200
about .5% and then when I talk about

721
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:31,518
high nitrogen think about 2% or higher

722
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,038
or 1 5% or higher there um about there

723
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,440
um and in the lower part we have the

724
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:41,319
biochars at 350 low and high at 700 low

725
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,480
and high and what we can see is that

726
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,200
overwhelmingly there is a lot more

727
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,120
mineralization of the carbon in the

728
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,759
biomass and a lot less in the biochars

729
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,439
and there are differences between the

730
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,240
biochars in terms of whether you have

731
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,320
more or less nitrogen but when we look

732
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,519
at the total commu uh Comm

733
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:05,119
cumulative um SE mineralization of all

734
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,759
these materials what we see is that

735
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:11,719
while the mineralization as the CN ratio

736
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:14,240
increases actually decreases for the for

737
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,200
the biomass and it is statistically

738
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
significant there are no differences

739
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,240
between the two biochars so there is

740
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:26,000
actually no meaning or not it's not as

741
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:28,880
meaningful to to use CN um to determine

742
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,240
the the stability of of

743
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,600
Char um and here's what happened with

744
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,960
nitrogen um basically nitrogen was

745
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,558
immobilized during the course of our

746
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,120
study and that might have been LED not

747
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,038
only to the fact that the nitrogen was

748
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,918
in a different form but we also weren't

749
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,720
providing any other sources of nitrogen

750
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:47,360
so the nitrogen that was available was

751
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,960
um

752
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:54,119
immobilized now this is the final part

753
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,919
and the final part was well what is

754
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,599
conferring stability to the Chart other

755
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,480
than the carbon what what role does

756
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,839
nitrogen actually play in the stability

757
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,558
of biochar so we fractionated the

758
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,759
biochar right so we actually took the

759
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,800
the volatiles which we hypothesized

760
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,760
would be the most easily mineralizable

761
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,000
POS possibly um form of nitrogen in the

762
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:21,960
CH and we took the functional groups of

763
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,320
that um um group and we correlated those

764
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,760
against the mineralization of the

765
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,639
biochar and saw if there was any

766
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,960
correlations and there was um we were

767
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,760
able to predict using the the functional

768
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,878
groups of the volatiles 75% of the of

769
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,200
the mineralization that occurred in our

770
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:42,918
biochars and these three groups or

771
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,039
functional groups were responsible or

772
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,239
these three group forms of nitrogen were

773
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,639
responsible or had something to do with

774
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,719
the uh stability or mineralization in

775
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,159
this case we have the highly aromatic

776
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:58,480
six-member Rings which was negatively um

777
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,720
correlated with mineralization and even

778
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,599
though this is an

779
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:07,239
aromatic um structure we are actually

780
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,760
looking at the proportion of this type

781
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,078
of nitrogen so the single bonded

782
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,520
nitrogen um and so it kind of makes

783
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,599
sense that it would be positively

784
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,559
correlated and significant with

785
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,680
mineralization and then in this case we

786
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,440
just have a nitrogen outside of the of a

787
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:22,838
cycle which if we hypothesize well am I

788
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,000
going to go for the easy thing or the

789
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:26,599
difficult thing to chew on a microb

790
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
might actually go for the easier thing

791
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:32,160
so it also makes sense that it would

792
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,760
have been the nitrogen outside of the

793
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,399
ring that had

794
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,079
um cor positive correlation with um

795
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,519
mineralization of the

796
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,079
biochar so when we put this all together

797
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,000
what is all

798
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,519
mean

799
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,800
um like I said when we look at

800
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,318
biochar when we look at biochars we can

801
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,960
no longer look at biochar by itself we

802
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,279
need to look at a part as a whole and we

803
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,159
need to look at what happens when you're

804
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,760
making biochar and in this

805
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,118
case figuring out what the parameters

806
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,359
that are affecting the the figuring out

807
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,000
the parameters that are affecting the

808
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,920
gashes emission um Dynamics it's really

809
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,639
important because then that allows us to

810
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,440
go back to the drawing board and improve

811
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,519
in in in designs that are you know

812
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,240
ultimately being used by women in Africa

813
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,280
and currently they are being used in

814
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,039
some households so that's a really big

815
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,200
deal that we need to pay attention that

816
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,159
sure we're we're really really

817
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,000
interested in reducing Co and no and

818
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,159
retention of nitrogen in the biochar for

819
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,960
maybe climate um impacts but we are also

820
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:46,879
very interested in doing that to reduce

821
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:50,119
um um impact on human health and when it

822
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,838
comes down to to to what you do now with

823
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,559
the biochar that you have or what what

824
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,799
what these farmers do with the N with

825
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:58,279
the with the biochar that they have it's

826
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,640
really important to know what happens to

827
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,599
that nitrogen because if you have a

828
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,358
farmer that is going to take a high

829
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,640
nitrogen containing residue and turning

830
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:09,598
into biochar is did that really worth it

831
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,159
it is is is locking that nitrogen into

832
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,280
these highly aromatic structures worth

833
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,399
it for them and so that's those are the

834
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,280
kind of things that we need to be

835
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,519
thinking about when we actually think

836
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,160
about making biochar when we actually

837
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,599
think about introducing

838
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,920
stoves that are um um going to make

839
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,079
biochar what what are the overall

840
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,000
implications to the people in the system

841
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,200
to the users in the system and so you

842
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,960
know we know that that that it changes

843
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,519
um um and the type of nitrogen

844
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,480
stabilizes the carbon but we also want

845
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,159
to know what are the implications for

846
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,159
Farmers along the way that actually

847
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:49,159
using these these um

848
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,159
materials that's it thank

849
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,880
you

850
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,800
Marathon this has been a production of

851
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,800
Cornell University on the web at
