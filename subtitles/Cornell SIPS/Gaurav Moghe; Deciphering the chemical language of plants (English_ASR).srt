1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:14,878
University okay uh so today I'm going

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,359
to uh talk about uh different things but

4
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:18,719
before I start um thank you Jen for the

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,480
introduction and thank you all for

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:26,079
coming for this talk now um okay as this

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,199
picture indicates um I'm going to cover

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,479
a lot of ground today I'm going to talk

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,719
about uh

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,799
not a part but a most of my research

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,439
program um and I'm going to try and

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,439
attempt to do that in the next 45

13
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,959
minutes should start my timer okay um so

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,039
there will be a lot of projects being

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
talked about and I'm going to give you a

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,760
bird's eye view of the different

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,280
projects but if you want to know more in

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,519
detail i' I'd be happy to talk about

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,719
that later today or any time um before I

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,199
get into the research part I'd like to

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,920
thank or acknowledge a lot of people who

22
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:05,239
have helped us with with the world so

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,640
starting with people in my lab um post

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,200
dogs lap teexs uh grad students

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,960
undergrads areu students all of them

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,719
I've done all all of what I'm going to

27
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,478
show is actually done by them so all

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,158
crit goes to them um we have had the

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,319
fortune of having a number of

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,880
collaborators in plant

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,879
biology don't I should use maybe this uh

32
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,599
lot of collaborators in plant biology

33
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,158
inps

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,000
at in Cornell in outside of ss as well

35
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,560
as uh outside of Cornell so um I

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,719
appreciate and acknowledge their

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,079
guidance and and help in all our

38
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:48,478
research uh special thanks to Frank

39
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:52,438
Scher uh he down here but Frank sh bti U

40
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,158
he let us use his MPEG for the last

41
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,718
seven years and we've run thousands if

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,359
not low tens of thousands of samples on

43
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,078
the MPC so every morning when I wake up

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,599
I I pray to the longevity and safety of

45
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,399
the

46
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,199
MPEG as you see a lot of data generated

47
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,878
using that and thanks to the funding

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,039
agencies that have funded this uh all of

49
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:18,000
the research so my lab works on plant

50
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,799
metabolism um and personally I like this

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,680
topic because it is at the interface of

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,000
both basic and applied research plants U

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,840
make a lot of natural products which we

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,080
use in our uh daily lives but they don't

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,000
make it for us to use right they make

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,480
for their own use um and because of the

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,479
diverse roles of these metabolites not

58
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,199
only does it satisfy my intellectual

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:43,840
curiosity it also U for plants it

60
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,318
produces a huge uh number of comp they

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,319
they produce a huge number of compounds

62
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:49,479
it's estimated that across the plant

63
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,759
kingdom there was a million metabolites

64
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,759
produced and individual plants produce

65
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,519
thousands of metabolites in different

66
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,359
organs this diversity is because of the

67
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
complexity of the underlying metabolic

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
pathways right uh we have barely

69
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,839
scratched the surface of both the

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,200
metabolome as as well as the genetic

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,280
networks that produce this diversity

72
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,479
that's what my lab has been focused over

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,919
the last seven years and because there

74
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,359
are number of projects uh we have

75
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,679
classified them into three major types

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,200
first of all figuring out what is the

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,280
scale of this diversity uh how is this

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,759
diversity produced at The evolutionary

79
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,039
and biochemical level and how can we use

80
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,598
it for our own purposes we work with a

81
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,719
number of models systems and I'm going

82
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,679
to talk about some of them in this

83
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:39,519
research so um the next few slides are

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,799
organized in this manner uh so if uh

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,719
I'll talk about the three areas and then

86
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,400
end with just one slide on summary and

87
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,919
future plans although each of the areas

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,920
also contain um know what we are

89
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:54,238
currently working on uh starting with

90
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:58,719
metabolomics um now as I said we do a

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,319
lot of mass spec and uh it's a lot of

92
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,799
people do transcript do and genomics but

93
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:03,598
there are some challenges associated

94
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
with

95
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,839
metabolomics the first is that the name

96
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,400
itself is a misnomer when we do

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
metabolomic we are doing basically

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,400
metabolic profiling when you do

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,199
transcriptomic you are getting most of

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,959
the transcriptor Express at that given

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,680
time but in metabolomic because there

102
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,840
are so many diverse chemical structures

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,478
uh we have this this compound which has

104
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,000
a lot of hydroxy sugars but these

105
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,439
carotenoids produce have do do not have

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,038
anything that uh that will El it to

107
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,120
solubilize it's a long hydrocarbon chain

108
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:38,839
and so the type of extraction solvent to

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,800
use will determine what sort of

110
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,399
compounds will be extracted right um

111
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
then they have to move in a

112
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,359
electromagnetic field to get ionized and

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,840
the type of mass spec you use the

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,560
parameters you set the masses you set

115
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,879
will Define what sort of compounds you

116
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,560
detect and then the type of colum

117
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,360
chemistry use will also determine how

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,879
many how well you are able to separate

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,520
those compounds so the first challenge

120
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,360
here is when you are sampling the

121
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,599
metabolome you are getting only a small

122
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,439
part of it and even if you get a small

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,199
part of it when it comes to annotation

124
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,719
less than 5% of the Peaks can be

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
annotated in transcriptomic or you know

126
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,320
when you have a gene sequence Sanger

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,800
sequence you can blast it again CBI you

128
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,360
can get the domain domain and you have

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,160
some information about what that Gene

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,000
does uh looking at it's a transcription

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,240
factor or whatever but what about this

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,680
95% of the metabolome for which you

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,639
don't know anything uh so that's what we

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,918
we tried to do uh we have been trying to

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,038
work on uh as part of our research

136
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,560
looking at uh if we know the

137
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,639
fragmentation pattern of these

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
metabolites can we get better insights

139
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,000
into this

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,440
95% I'm going to give you this case

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,079
study of resin glycosides which are

142
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,160
structur chemicals produced in concious

143
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,279
species that includes sweet potatoes and

144
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,160
some other horticulturally important

145
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,679
crops uh this resin glycosites comprised

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
of this oligosaccharide chain to which

147
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,759
you have these ail chains attached and

148
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,120
this long c16 fatty acid with hydroxy

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,038
can attached and uh there is there are

150
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,280
lots of variations upon this basic

151
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,680
structure U these compounds are

152
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,959
important against various insects and

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,759
neod and they also have medicinal

154
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:26,159
properties so um what we figured out was

155
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,120
there is some pattern in how these

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,400
compounds fragment in a mass spec uh the

157
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,399
masses

158
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,758
these can change a little bit but we can

159
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,758
predict what sort of uh masses they

160
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,680
might have so if you computationally dig

161
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,759
into the mass spec data can we recover

162
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,400
more compounds this

163
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,879
way um that's what lar and Ali did uh in

164
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,120
my lab they were looking at 30 different

165
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,959
species of the kovia family and you can

166
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,759
ignore all of the structural details we

167
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,038
were able to extract lot of features

168
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
from the MPE data this First Column is

169
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,519
important this shows how many resin

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,199
glycosides were discovered in species

171
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,318
now just to give you some context since

172
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,038
1992 when these compounds are first

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
discovered there are about 300 resin

174
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,959
glycosides known and in one species

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
itself we can find over 330 resin

176
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,478
glycosides using computation analysis

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
and we can get a lot of structural

178
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,598
information of those so using this uh

179
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,319
analysis we are able to uh make better

180
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:27,240
sense of uh of the metabolites that

181
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
exist in in the metabol now initially we

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,079
were doing this in a very stepwise

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,039
manner you know we used to click on each

184
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,918
peak in the MPE data and then look at it

185
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,839
manually then we started writing some

186
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,240
Python scripts to dig into the F that

187
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,318
was also a little faster but still um uh

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,199
slow enough uh last year uh visha who is

189
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,759
now first year plan biia student uh in

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,120
CL Cas lab he wrote this he developed

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,400
this website where you can just now uh

192
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,280
upload the MPE data files and within a

193
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,239
couple of seconds you're able to get all

194
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,719
the resin glycosides added ified so this

195
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,639
simplifies the workflow quite a bit in

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,000
our analysis um now what sort of

197
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,400
biological information can this

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,759
diversity reveal here uh this is called

199
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,679
a msms molecular network of all the

200
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,120
resin glycosides we could detect across

201
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,840
all species the green color indicates

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,840
the resin glycosites found in

203
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,638
convolvulus genus species and the purple

204
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,598
ones are those found in in ipia and you

205
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,519
can clearly see the diversification that

206
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,519
has occurred between these two Genera

207
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,679
that speaks to some biochemical uh

208
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,158
divers diversity um when we can because

209
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,598
we have the structure information we can

210
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,879
see what sort of pattern exists and in

211
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,440
homia species we see low molecular

212
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,399
weight Regin glycosites in conus we see

213
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,279
high molecular weight Regin glycosides

214
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,720
and we also see the asil chains that are

215
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:54,519
added they also vary so we are trying to

216
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,200
dig into these aspects more and this

217
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,078
also enabled us actually to select some

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
species for RNA SE because we know the

219
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:05,359
issues specific uh differential

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
patterns now uh basati who is a grad

221
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,680
student in the lab is looking at

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,519
different accessions of uh of sweet

223
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,599
potato because these are connected with

224
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,959
nro defense and um she's trying to

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,680
figure out how the diversity of resin

226
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,719
glycosides vary and then IRA and AOK in

227
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:26,078
the lab is looking at the biosynthesis

228
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,800
of these resin glycosites so p450s bhds

229
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,078
uh glycosite transferases that are

230
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,838
involved in resin glycosite biosynthesis

231
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,399
so you can engineer them in other plants

232
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,279
that do not have these these

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,600
compounds uh so what this results show

234
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,759
is that if you know the msms

235
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,278
fragmentation pattern we can make a lot

236
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,879
more sense out of the diversity right

237
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,200
we've shown this for other metabolite

238
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,200
classes to antoin and flavonoids in

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,079
different colored sweet potatoes um and

240
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,480
then AC sugars inum hoces and I'm going

241
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,639
to talk about this story in a few slides

242
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,920
later but basically it can be done if

243
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,519
you have msms fragmentation knowledge

244
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,559
you can apply it to get more compounds

245
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,399
annotated but what if you don't know

246
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,639
what the fragmentation patterns are or

247
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:14,320
if the patterns are not consistent um we

248
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,879
have tried to uh analyze or Champion two

249
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,278
types of methods one will identification

250
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,399
free analysis uh which is basically

251
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,838
multivariate statistical methods and

252
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,639
then instead of specific compounds we

253
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,160
can look at compound classes so for

254
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,879
example how are flavenoids changing

255
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,799
under stress or how are uh nucleotides

256
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,360
changing and so on this work was done by

257
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,838
Liz who was a plant biology student now

258
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,720
a post dog at M she she was working on

259
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,279
uh braip podium in collaboration with

260
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,360
olena olena's lab and Maria Harrison's

261
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,360
lab and Joint genome Institute so um we

262
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,240
grew braip Podium under different

263
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,440
conditions uh environmental conditions

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,000
these are hydroponic conditions these

265
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,040
were grown in some special sand soil

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,679
mixture uh from where we could isolate

267
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,639
Ro fs and these were grow in regular

268
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,719
soil and the goal was to get RNA and

269
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,799
metabolomic data and establish some

270
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,399
correlations to uh know predict Gene

271
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,958
function or annotate Gene function

272
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,879
better um now we did some preliminary

273
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,719
processing with this data and I'm going

274
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,720
to just show you a couple of this whole

275
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
paper is like 30 supplementary files

276
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,120
with nine figures but I'm just going to

277
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,000
show you two two figures from there one

278
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,759
is U this diversity and specialization

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
which

280
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,720
basically metrics derived from

281
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,320
ecological Theory or actually

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,480
information Theory which um diversity

283
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,440
implies how divers given metabol is in

284
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,039
terms of the represent it's like Shannon

285
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,560
diversity how many Peaks are there how

286
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,958
many uh what's the uh relative abundance

287
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,039
of different Peaks and we see leaves are

288
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,638
much more diverse than Roots

289
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,399
metabolically um but we also saw that

290
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,399
roots are more responsive to different

291
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,200
stresses uh we see that the

292
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,639
specialization this is uh Roots grown in

293
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,759
in a specific hydroponic condition um

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
and when we apply heat stress the the

295
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,559
metabolome becomes much more specializ

296
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,518
there are many more unique metabolites

297
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,679
that show up under heat stress in The

298
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,078
Roots which does not occur that much in

299
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,919
in the

300
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,638
leaves uh this is another representation

301
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,719
of the same here I'm showing a metric

302
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,159
called rdpi a relative distance

303
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,240
plasticity index and it basically

304
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:32,278
measures how much your uh the entire

305
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,079
metabolome is changing up and down

306
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,360
together combined how much is it

307
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,638
changing in response to a given

308
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,639
condition compared to the control so the

309
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,720
first five columns are the are the

310
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
leaves and the next five columns are the

311
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,759
roots the same thing for the

312
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,839
transcriptor the leaves don't change

313
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,958
much overall the metabol doesn't change

314
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,560
much under the different conditions but

315
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,399
Roots it changes quite a bit and

316
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,958
interestingly um when plants were grown

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,519
under a heat stress the metabol changed

318
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:05,000
the most this is one day of heat stress

319
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,240
um but for one week before the heat

320
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,720
stress if they were grown under copper

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,278
deficiency conditions it did not change

322
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,680
as much we expected two stresses to have

323
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,679
a lot more change but somehow the no

324
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:20,599
copper buffers the change in the

325
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:23,519
metabolome as well as a transcriptor um

326
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,199
so why is this happening and if this

327
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
does this have any phenotypic change we

328
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:30,198
did some experiments uh with olena later

329
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
on and if you are interested we talk

330
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:35,078
about that at the end of the

331
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,759
presentation now looking at structural

332
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:40,198
classes uh we use this method called

333
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,559
canopus which instead of predicting from

334
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:45,240
a Mass

335
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:48,399
Spectrum this is s no methan it will say

336
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,240
it give this classes of metabolites um

337
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
and then you can see okay we can take

338
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,879
all the deoxy ribonucleosides and see

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,800
how that entire class is changing under

340
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:01,078
the given condition the advantage of

341
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,919
this method is instead of 5% of the

342
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,679
metabolic features that we could

343
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:08,439
identify using traditional approaches we

344
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,838
can go to 40% in fact we could go to 80%

345
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,199
and then we removed a lot of predictions

346
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,079
after quality an extensive quality

347
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,198
analysis um so 40 it's like a

348
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,039
significant bump right in how much you

349
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,039
can analyze uh this is showing the

350
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,198
different classes of metabolites and

351
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,719
again rdpi on the y axis showing and the

352
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,399
first five are again leaves uh next five

353
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,959
next five columns are rul and I'd like

354
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,480
you to focus your attention on just

355
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,919
these two panels here U what we found

356
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
out was flavenoids were highly perturbed

357
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,319
in The Roots compared to the leaves

358
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,278
under all conditions and then furanoid

359
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,839
ligant were highly perturbed under heat

360
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,198
stress so this gives us some hypothesis

361
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,720
uh and models to start digging into the

362
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:56,198
data and know associated with RNA seek

363
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,120
for example we see flavonoids also the

364
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,559
enzymes also were significantly

365
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,000
downregulated in the

366
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:07,319
pathway now ongoing work we are uh know

367
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
focusing a lot on how do we get better

368
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,680
annotation for the metabol we don't want

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,278
to throw away 95% of the data or even

370
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,799
60% of the data so in collaboration with

371
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,198
various researchers across the country

372
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,439
they're trying to develop a ontology

373
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,519
system for metabolome just like Gene

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,959
onology so we can do a lot more uh

375
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:30,839
deeper analysis into suspect and uh

376
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,278
recently we got funded uh for a

377
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,920
International Center for uh plant

378
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,318
resilience based out of MSU but it

379
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,078
involves several institutions in the US

380
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:44,838
as well as uh researchers across the

381
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:47,078
world um the goal of this Center is to

382
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,319
uh not only find out new chemicals from

383
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,278
plant extracts uh for agrochemical use

384
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,159
but also find out the genes involved in

385
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:58,039
that pathway engineer those uh Pathways

386
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,278
in yeast and plants Etc and then test

387
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:03,399
those in field thingss so this is going

388
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:05,679
to be an exciting project going

389
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,198
forward now I'm going to shift from the

390
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:11,638
metabolome to uh the the genetic aspect

391
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,078
of our research and talk about how this

392
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,240
diversity evolves and one at the enzyme

393
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,078
level and second zooming out again at a

394
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,879
very large geographical level so for

395
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,758
looking at enzymes these are the

396
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,480
contributors these are the main drivers

397
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,720
of metabolic diversity right we focus on

398
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,680
an enzyme family called BHD a

399
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,319
transferase and this en enzyme HCT uh

400
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:36,000
which is a BSG does a simple reaction of

401
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,240
transferring this pumar group to a

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
hydroxy or an amine group on the

403
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,360
acceptor U now the reaction is very

404
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,839
simple but bhds use a variety of

405
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,278
different substrates some of these are

406
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,440
aromatic alcohols aliphatic alcohols

407
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,360
these are amines aromatic amines and

408
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,199
more complex structures and all of these

409
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,240
are uh involved in a variety of

410
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,599
different processes in the plant from

411
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,519
reproduction growth development stress

412
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
response Etc so understanding how bhds

413
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,400
have come to use these substrate types

414
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,838
that's that's been uh know a curiosity

415
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,319
of mind um that's where we started off

416
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:17,798
this project and uh you need to know

417
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:20,838
here that bhds do not exist across all

418
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:22,400
living organisms they are even in algae

419
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,000
they are present in only one to two

420
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,559
copies in the alal genomes and they have

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,599
expanded significantly in land plants

422
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:33,678
dozens and hundreds of in each genome it

423
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,159
turns out that um in unipro there are

424
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,679
only 55

425
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,400
bhds with activities that are deposited

426
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,038
and there are 100 bhds in tomato alone

427
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,559
so that gives you a scale of how much

428
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,558
Gap there is between what is annotated

429
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,639
what is there in databases versus what

430
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,200
is what where we need to get to and this

431
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,559
is not surprising because we found out a

432
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,679
couple of years ago there only two

433
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:01,359
people in plant in unipro doing plant

434
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,559
work this is not just curators uh

435
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,479
looking at enzyme papers or metabolism

436
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:08,359
papers across all plants only two people

437
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,319
reading all the thousands of papers

438
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,599
published every week and putting them in

439
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,480
unipro um and this this is obviously a

440
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,879
major constraint for a lot of different

441
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,079
Downstream

442
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,080
activities we decided to give them a

443
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:26,199
helping hand uh at least for bsds and L

444
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:29,199
post du in the lab look he read 100 100

445
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,319
odd papers and collected 200 one

446
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,038
biochemically characterized BDS 171

447
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,558
substrates of these BS and put them into

448
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,839
11 different structural classes right so

449
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,798
they use a lot of structural classes as

450
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,399
a whole but just to take a step back and

451
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,440
think about how much effort this must

452
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,519
have taken for L uh it's it's a boring

453
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,320
job reading papers and you know putting

454
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,440
everything in an Excel file one by one

455
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:59,798
making sure everything is correct um and

456
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,360
so that paper was published uh in 20 92

457
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:05,200
uh Nate uh who is now a first year planb

458
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,038
student came into the picture last year

459
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,640
and uh he started doing this job too and

460
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,319
he got bored too and we had two

461
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,480
undergrads uh we we we said we we can

462
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,240
pay you and they said no keep your money

463
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,839
you don't want to do this it was it's a

464
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,159
boring job so Nate started thinking

465
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,000
about more Innovative approaches and he

466
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,559
he asked what if we could use Char GPT

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to read papers instead of any humans

468
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:35,519
because no we can take away their jobs

469
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,119
easily so he came up with this pipeline

470
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,918
called auton Nate which which enables

471
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,199
rapid uration of papers uh I actually

472
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,360
wanted to call it autter Nate but Nate

473
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,558
went the more professional route I'd

474
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:52,038
call it pun fetch which is a much better

475
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,440
professional name than autate but

476
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,519
essentially uh this pipeline goes

477
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,000
through reads through a bunch of papers

478
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,279
his screens through thousands of

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,159
abstract

480
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,720
uh published in pbet and then selects a

481
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,120
small set of papers from each of those

482
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,960
papers it reads it extracts out the

483
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,918
enzyme activities enzyme name enzyme

484
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,960
substrate information um species

485
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,159
information Etc and then we curate it

486
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:23,640
manually um we it took a lot of time for

487
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,640
Lars to do just the bhds but using this

488
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:31,038
pipeline we illuminated a lot of enzymes

489
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,798
using using this

490
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:38,038
pipeline uh we were able to Screen

491
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,400
through 27,000 apps this is too dark but

492
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,000
the previous lighting was good we

493
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,240
screened through 27,000 abstracts uh

494
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,839
very quickly with a cost of what $65

495
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,640
actually um and then for 5,500 papers we

496
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,439
extracted a bunch of different

497
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,000
attributes like the DOI Journal name

498
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,320
species name enzyme ID and Bank idid Etc

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,960
uh very quickly so this for all of these

500
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:09,279
5,500 papers should cost uh about $300

501
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,360
or so oh no actually a little more I

502
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,759
think 1,00 but um from this we extracted

503
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,879
32,000 rows of activity some of these

504
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,558
were hallucinations actually this is

505
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,440
after filtering for hallucinations and I

506
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,000
can talk about that interesting bit

507
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,840
later if you are interested um and these

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,359
are under active cation right now uh

509
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,918
just to give you a sense of how much

510
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:35,240
improvement this makes uh we submitted

511
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,320
we know curated this uh heavily for bhds

512
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,679
and we submitted the activities to three

513
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:44,278
different databases in unipro itself uh

514
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,480
from 55 this goes to 250 is a fivefold

515
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:50,038
jump uh if we take the accurated

516
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,960
activities and put it into databases so

517
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,599
uh you know and you can trust what goes

518
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,759
into unipr now because at least two and

519
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,240
mostly three people have looked at each

520
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,240
entry and then uni will also look at it

521
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,720
this is going to be high

522
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,480
quality um now that's all technical how

523
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,440
can we use this compiled activities for

524
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,919
uncovering new biology uh firstly we can

525
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,519
do evolutionary analysis from the these

526
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:19,600
are all the 200 and one biochemically

527
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,839
characterized bhds that lar had

528
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,599
extracted um and each of the concentric

529
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,319
circles here is one of those 11

530
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,519
substrate classes so we know this C uses

531
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,839
aromatic alcohol clear uses antoin and

532
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,558
flavenoids and so on we could Define

533
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,839
eight clears based on the bootstrap

534
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,519
values at least eight but there are many

535
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:43,079
more which are not represented in this

536
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:46,200
uh in this figure uh because they are

537
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:50,678
uncharacterized now uh we can also go

538
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,120
back and see how activities have evolved

539
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,880
through their expansion in land plants

540
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,678
so for that we need to know what is the

541
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,400
ancestral activity and the colors on the

542
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,200
branches indic IND Ates how far back the

543
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,600
orthologous group of that enzyme is

544
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,200
conserved so if it is orange it means

545
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,558
the orthologous group is conserved uh in

546
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,840
angiosperm gymnosperms Moses liver

547
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,639
wordss in all of land plants if it's

548
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,319
blue purple it means it's only present

549
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,559
in diots and angos spms right so we know

550
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,519
this these three substrate classes the

551
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:25,079
ability to isolate these three substrate

552
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,960
classes existed in all of land plants um

553
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,519
and this is important because these

554
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,440
three this is involve in lant

555
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,119
biosynthesis mostly this is involved in

556
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,200
vxi Ester biosynthesis and polyamine

557
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,359
isolation these three features are

558
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,840
important for the conquest of land for

559
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:43,519
terrestrialization and so bsds played an

560
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:47,119
important role in that process um we can

561
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,879
also uh then this particular C this is a

562
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,519
new activity it came only in it it

563
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,600
existed promiscuously for a long time

564
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,038
for millions of years but it got fixed

565
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,918
in the gene pool only in angiosperms and

566
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,079
uh we did did motive analysis to figure

567
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,520
out what is special about these enzymes

568
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,720
is C turns out that there is a Stan

569
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,278
which is unique and the which is unique

570
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,159
uh in in in this Cades and doing side

571
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,159
directed mutagenesis we showed that both

572
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,640
of these are important

573
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,400
cryptopanic uh for activity than the

574
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,200
system uh we collaborated with diwakar

575
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,038
shukas lab at arbana champagne who did

576
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,960
molecular Dynamic simulations and

577
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:34,200
basically they showed the tryptophan it

578
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,798
um it holds the the antoin in place uh

579
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,759
for the catalysis the hisan is a

580
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,079
catalytic site of the residue and the

581
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,798
tryptophan holds the antoin in place

582
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,119
through Pipi interactions if the

583
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,278
tryptophan is gone Anto wobbles around

584
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,678
in the active site and there is no

585
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,038
isolation that happens if the cine is

586
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,480
gone the tryptophan also wobbles by

587
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:58,480
itself so the antoon also wobbles and

588
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,120
there is no activity so in 100% of

589
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,120
enzymes in that c you see

590
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:07,359
cryptophane and so that's it was

591
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:10,519
important for the uh evolution of that

592
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,639
activity uh now we are focusing on two

593
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,639
different uh plates uh two different

594
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,840
plates in these families one is this

595
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,159
very long disordered region that's

596
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,480
present only in the ligman ulating

597
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,320
enzymes and nowhere else we've shown

598
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,120
that this is there is some selective

599
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:30,599
pressure uh maintaining this as flexible

600
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,239
uh we've changed this to a know a rigid

601
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,398
region by doing SED mutagenesis it

602
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,440
increases the specificity of this enzyme

603
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,918
towards Native substrates we're digging

604
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,159
into that uh phenotype further and then

605
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,278
um going into the broader scale of how

606
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,039
do we predict the uh activities of

607
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,558
enzyme how can we make uh protein

608
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,558
function prediction better suing Chen is

609
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,038
the first year plant breeding student

610
00:25:53,558 --> 00:26:00,000
she is looking at AI models as well as

611
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,480
phenetic based prediction of of function

612
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,240
in enzyme families and then Shinu is a

613
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,480
postdoc in the lab who is looking at

614
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,440
validating these predictions using

615
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,679
traditional approaches like wigs enzy

616
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,200
masses as well as using some synthetic

617
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,240
biology

618
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,840
techniques okay now I'm going to zoom

619
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,880
into a mucho zoom out into a broader

620
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,519
scale of geographical Evolution uh for

621
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,120
this again the model system is different

622
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,398
U here we I'm going to talk about serum

623
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,759
hroes which is a wild Tom that grows in

624
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,119
Peru and

625
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:36,158
eador these this produces Aces sugars

626
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,839
Aces sugars are like resin glycosides

627
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,480
they have a sucrose core two different

628
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:44,079
acil chains are attached and they

629
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,798
produced from this one tiny cell on top

630
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,240
of the leaf and stem surfaces and it

631
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,960
makes the surface of the leaf very

632
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,079
sticky so insects don't like to lay eggs

633
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,399
water is acts like a water barrier um in

634
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:01,038
different populations of hites the

635
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:03,879
uh a sugar profiles are different in

636
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,359
tomato there are only 10 or so AC sugars

637
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,640
but in s hoces are lot more and

638
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,798
different between different populations

639
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,278
so robas lab back 12 years ago actually

640
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:18,480
2012 they had looked at 55 different

641
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,640
accessions of serum hites spread across

642
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,720
the range and they found two major

643
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,278
chemotypic clusters uh for for this

644
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,440
species uh they found out that this

645
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,480
enzyme is mut ated in some of these

646
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,840
accessions and uh this acetal group is

647
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
missing in these AC Sugar in in one of

648
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:42,439
these I think Super cluster two it's

649
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:45,640
missing this aetl group um when that was

650
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,519
mapped out on the on the species on the

651
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,000
locations of these accessions from where

652
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,480
they were collected all of the

653
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,798
inactivations were were above this line

654
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,839
above this line here all of these

655
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,398
populations are inactivated but that's

656
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,199
not the most interesting part the

657
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,079
interesting part is that the losses

658
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,840
occurred by three different means here

659
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,000
the gene is present but there is no

660
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,759
expression here there's a frame shift

661
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,398
that CA that's uh causes function in

662
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,960
activ the gene is expressed but there is

663
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,839
frame shift and uh here we cannot even

664
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,200
detect a at first so three different

665
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,759
means of the same enzyme getting lost

666
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,240
how is it possible and what's special

667
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,879
about this line when I started u working

668
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,359
on this project uh the idea was very

669
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,880
simple I I wanted to figure out where

670
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,359
the species originated how it has moved

671
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,399
across the range and then uh see you

672
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,000
know how these chemotypes evolved for

673
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:43,759
this I did Rad sequencing of 50 son

674
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,200
hoces accessions and four sonum penia

675
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,440
accessions uh and after I came here I

676
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,798
started analyzing this data along with

677
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:56,159
Jacob Landis who is uh in plant biology

678
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:58,839
in the spec and oil Labs uh he uh helped

679
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,559
with the population genomic analysis and

680
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:04,240
even at the genotypic level we found two

681
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,960
different super clusters again bordering

682
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,919
around this line so that was very

683
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,919
surprising and we spent a lot of time uh

684
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,320
figuring out I'm ashamed to say that

685
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,240
after five years of working on this

686
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:20,480
project suddenly uh it clicked and what

687
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,440
clicked was looking at the geography of

688
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,000
this region um turned out that the the

689
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,919
backdrop the geography the ecology had a

690
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,119
very significant impact

691
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,278
uh need so this is all everything is

692
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:37,518
occurring in the backdrop of this Andis

693
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:40,919
mountain range which is which is like a

694
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,798
huge wall of rock that emerges and on

695
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,720
the on the South American coast and

696
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,679
there is no East West movements of

697
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,519
species possible because of this huge

698
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:55,159
ball it's like very tall right um and

699
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,640
there are some parts like this wab bomba

700
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,278
depression some of these depressions

701
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,159
where species can move East West W um

702
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,000
now this region that I showed where

703
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,799
there two genotypic clusters super

704
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,640
clusters happening two chemotypic super

705
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,759
cluster happening that's happening in

706
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,320
this region called the amapi Waba Zone

707
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:15,879
which uh which which is right here it's

708
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:19,759
one of the depressions and this region

709
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,399
is so uh there are so many small um

710
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,919
habitats micro habitats because there

711
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,199
are this this region has been influenced

712
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,038
by tectonic activity volcanic activity

713
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,720
Pacific Ocean has come in gone out uh

714
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,480
there are riverine beds weather patterns

715
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,360
are different so there are so many

716
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,360
microhabitats that one six of all plant

717
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:42,918
species are found in in tropical anes

718
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:46,319
most of those are many of those are

719
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,278
concentr are due to the the endemism

720
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,678
present in the

721
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:55,519
asz so this is where all of the uh the

722
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,440
chemical and gen genotypic evolution is

723
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,599
happening the blue dots of Sol hoces on

724
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,278
the west so in the southern part of the

725
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,278
range it just is on the western slopes

726
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:09,119
of the Andes it's a very dry region with

727
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:12,519
hardly any precipitation and here it

728
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:15,239
sneaked into the Andes and it goes up

729
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,558
nor to Ecuador where it is very wet lot

730
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,880
of different coevolutionary processes

731
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,798
happening where it sneaked in in the

732
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,080
southern boundary of the amap hunab baz

733
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,679
that's where it sneaks in and this is

734
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,720
where we see all the inactivations

735
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,120
happen happening and the hka Bamba

736
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,600
depression is where we see the super

737
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:39,959
clusters being separated uh the power of

738
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:43,439
this super clust the the uh geographical

739
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,079
uh uh isolation is so high that in the

740
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,720
South we see isolation by distance

741
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,240
that's what you typically see uh as as

742
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,558
the populations move farther out there

743
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,399
is less genetic exchange so there is

744
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,200
more uh there's less gene flow happening

745
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:00,599
um uh because of distance but in the

746
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,519
north even though populations are very

747
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,038
close to each other like IA and Portland

748
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,038
they are very close to each other but

749
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:08,558
still there is no genetic flow occurring

750
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,599
because of this geographic isolation um

751
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:15,158
this is an example of that there are two

752
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:17,000
clusters population clusters U here uh

753
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,399
uh they are very close to each other but

754
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,558
genetically this is the FST fixation

755
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:23,278
index tree which shows how much is the

756
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:26,519
gene flow occurring between different

757
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,440
populations and uh this is the two

758
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,278
clusters here are separated by the wab

759
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,798
Bamba depression there is no gene flow

760
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,200
very little gene flow occurring between

761
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,720
these two

762
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,558
clusters and uh you might see here that

763
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,278
I have written uh SI s SC c c here

764
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,519
because when there is geographical

765
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:48,278
isolation the the species is uh an

766
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,880
ancestrally self incompatible species

767
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:53,960
but because mean if there is no gene

768
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,240
flow occurring uh and know you a plant

769
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,278
find itself without any uh other self

770
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,679
incompatible species members then it's

771
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,480
going to die that lineage going to die

772
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,798
out so there is a huge selection

773
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,200
pressure for evolution of

774
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,278
self-compatibility so in addition to

775
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,600
geography genotype chemical Evolution

776
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,798
that's another thing that has happened

777
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,119
in the species uh we worked with Pat

778
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,679
Binger at Colorado State who has been

779
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,879
working on self-compatibility in the

780
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,399
species and they found that north of the

781
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,000
otap hunab Bamba Zone SC has emerged

782
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,398
from SI five times the South it has

783
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,398
emerged just one

784
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:36,000
but two SI related genes uh have been

785
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,000
mutated several times north of the range

786
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,359
causing five independent emerges of

787
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,440
self-compatibility likely because of

788
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:46,000
this geographical isolation of these

789
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,639
populations so we also see uh all the

790
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,558
inactivations of uh acetated acid sugars

791
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:55,719
of set 4 happen north of the southern

792
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,480
boundary of the ASG and here you'll just

793
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,679
have to trust my word but uh

794
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,558
this is very complicated but what we

795
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,519
showed here was the five different

796
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,119
chemotypic super clusters chemotypic

797
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,639
clusters in as sugar that we saw

798
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,079
correlate very well with which kind of

799
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,200
self-c compatibility group uh it

800
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,159
belonged to so it it so happened that

801
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,279
here we have mixed populations you can

802
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,599
see here MPS mixed population which

803
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,240
means the self compatibility ales exist

804
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,320
but as het in heterozygous state so they

805
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,559
have just come about in the

806
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,879
geographically ased populations and as

807
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,279
they went up uh the populations got

808
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,519
fixed in different Corners uh and as

809
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,560
they went into homo ibocity they may

810
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,519
have pulled out uh the the

811
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,799
associated ASAT 4 ales along with them

812
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,838
resulting in those chemotypic clusters

813
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,519
so this is very much a example of a

814
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:53,440
Founder Effect when you see changes at

815
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,480
the genetic uh if you see you know some

816
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,720
transcript is heavily expressed or you

817
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,039
see difference in the metabol profile

818
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:02,519
FES of two individuals you see some

819
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,279
patterns you might be tempted to think

820
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,199
that this is to adaptation there's some

821
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,440
adaptive significance with but uh this

822
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,559
is happening just because you know

823
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,358
there's no other way it just happening

824
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,838
with a genetic drift one individual got

825
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,519
fixed in the population so this is uh it

826
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,400
should always be thought of as a null

827
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,199
hypothesis genetic drift and adaptation

828
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,480
should be tested against it and this was

829
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:29,118
a very clear evidence in in my mind at

830
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
least although we could not prove any of

831
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,838
this but uh I think it's happening

832
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,079
because of Foundry effect um in this

833
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:41,000
paper we talked about U the the model

834
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,560
for cohabitees population it emerged uh

835
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,159
over here and then it there are two

836
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,480
branches that moved north and south and

837
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,239
and went through all the chemotypic

838
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,519
genetic reproductive diversification as

839
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:58,559
it happened all right um so now U I'm

840
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:01,880
going to shift gears and talk about how

841
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,960
all of this metabolic diversity and

842
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,800
diversification uh and our understanding

843
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,960
of the genes can be applied for

844
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,200
improvement of Agriculture uh we we are

845
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,039
working on sweet potatoes as uh one of

846
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,159
the major projects in the lab and you

847
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,079
might wonder why sweet potatoes because

848
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,199
sweet potatoes is not really grown here

849
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,519
only 200 Acres of sweet potato grown in

850
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:25,559
New York um and most of the the biggest

851
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,719
grower in North Carolina as well as some

852
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,119
Southern States it's a warm weather grow

853
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,959
needs a lot of time for maturation but

854
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,119
there has been a lot of interest in

855
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,599
various northern states to grow sweet

856
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,680
potatoes including Canada right so um

857
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,519
they want to grow sweet potatoes

858
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:49,199
but this this result are very surprising

859
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:52,119
we grew sweet potatoes for two years in

860
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:56,078
U one plot was in Geneva and one plot

861
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,160
was near Albany and this is showing the

862
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,640
yields from the two locations they were

863
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,239
started at the same time from the same

864
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:06,199
stock and one grew like this another

865
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,559
grew like fingerlings uh and this is for

866
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:12,480
another variety and the second year it

867
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:15,679
was flipped it was literally flipped and

868
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,679
I spoke to the the extension person who

869
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,358
was helping us with this and like we see

870
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,440
that all the time you grow from one Hill

871
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,880
to another Hill in sweet P that's why

872
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,079
Growers don't like to grow sweet

873
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,680
potatoes they grow it in one corner of

874
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,960
the plot because you know there is so

875
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:32,399
much variation in in root uh root

876
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,838
phenotypes but there is an incentive to

877
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Growing this because of organic

878
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,039
cultivation it can command a premium

879
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,760
price there are no natural pests of

880
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:43,800
sweet potato in New York state and sweet

881
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,760
potato is a huge biomass crop so we can

882
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,720
use it for extracting dice colors Health

883
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,800
Foods Etc and there is a big industry in

884
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,358
in the Northeast uh for this for health

885
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,519
foods and that was that was our intent

886
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,440
in in in working with sweet potatoes and

887
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,280
colors how we can use it for these per

888
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,800
for these purposes but the main one of

889
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,920
the main reasons or the main bottlenecks

890
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,359
in this process is making how do we uh

891
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,079
make the root growth more resilient to

892
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,119
uh environmental change and no this is

893
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,680
the project we just we started a couple

894
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,599
of years ago so I don't have no great

895
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,719
results on it but um we have been

896
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,599
exploring the use of AR arbuscular

897
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,639
micros fungi as a way of increasing the

898
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,160
resilience as well as figuring out the

899
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:33,960
genetic basis of um of the water stress

900
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,838
resistance and uh resilience and and

901
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,039
root

902
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:40,119
growth this is an experiment that Iran

903
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,759
did last year where he grew sweet

904
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,800
potatoes under three different water

905
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,720
stress conditions as well as uh under

906
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,839
AMF and no AMF and of course the water

907
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,439
stress has a lot of effect on growth

908
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,078
that's expected but even between AMF and

909
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,639
no AMF you can see for this variety the

910
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,480
leaves Leaf quality is much better in

911
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,480
AMF conditions in fact the root weight

912
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,559
we we did a lot of phenotyping the root

913
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,480
weight was also significantly uh better

914
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,838
uh immediately after the stress if they

915
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,719
were given AMF conditions so uh there is

916
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:15,759
some possibility of using amfs uh we

917
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,559
also did metabolomic and transcriptomic

918
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,400
sampling under all of these conditions

919
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:23,480
and we are analyzing that right now um

920
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,920
another project on the application side

921
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,920
is uh looking at how we can engineer

922
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,480
crops to make novel bioactive compounds

923
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,838
for that we are using tomato as as a

924
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,480
model so tomato fruit develops uh quite

925
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,440
a bit and there are different varieties

926
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,800
which grow to different

927
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,838
sizes Shinu is working on uh taking the

928
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,720
turpenoid flux that goes into making

929
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,039
this red color lopine and diverting it

930
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:55,159
to making drugs which are based on the

931
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:57,199
tpid scaffold so uh we might have you

932
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,318
know instead of purple tomatoes we can

933
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,279
have Tomatoes making these uh

934
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:03,838
pharmaceutical

935
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,960
compounds and that's uh that's what

936
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:10,719
going on right now all right uh so uh

937
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,800
this is mostly the most of the research

938
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,799
that we are doing in the lab um to

939
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:21,680
summarize this this uh my talk I talked

940
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,000
about how Illuminating the the metabol

941
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,799
is is important and the steps we are

942
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,280
doing taking on that front uh

943
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,920
discovering and function is one of the

944
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,640
major areas in the lab uh as I said we

945
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,440
are collaborating with Arjun kakar's Lab

946
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:40,519
at Colorado State to develop novel in

947
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,920
biotools for functional validation and

948
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:44,400
another area of interest to me is

949
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,318
regulation of plant metabolism and how

950
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,318
gene expression uh evolves in or even

951
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:53,400
how different transcription factors

952
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:55,400
control different metabolic pathways

953
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,079
that's something we might work on in the

954
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,200
future engineering plan metabolism not

955
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,560
only for making these useful drugs but

956
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:07,559
also for stress resilience uh in sweet

957
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:10,519
potatoes in and other crops um and

958
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,799
finally discovering the genetic networks

959
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,440
and biochemical networks involved in in

960
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,519
stran

961
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Pathways okay I'll pull out this slide

962
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:24,199
again slide again and and take any

963
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:28,079
questions thank you already DES in the

964
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:31,439
or is it also generally new

965
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,519
yeah so I can so the question is whether

966
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,240
uh the the funk fetch tool is extracting

967
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,239
information from the papers or is it

968
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:42,559
also generating new information so the

969
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:45,159
goal of that of that pipeline is to just

970
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,719
extract information from the papers now

971
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:49,440
Nate discovered some very interesting

972
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,799
patterns of how it actually extracts out

973
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,400
so most of the time it extracts out from

974
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,318
the paper itself but sometimes it goes

975
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,000
into the references and pulls out in

976
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:00,880
activities from the references which

977
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,519
normally we would miss it's not part of

978
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,119
that paper we also found that it it

979
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,960
hallucinates quite a bit sometimes it it

980
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,400
pulls out information from its training

981
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,000
data we'll see a paper uh titled saying

982
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,079
you know it's from barley oats and

983
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,280
whatever and the enzyme activity is

984
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,240
pulled out is a human enzyme with B

985
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,040
Rubin and testosterone as substrates so

986
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,439
it's going into drug bank which is it

987
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,400
training data and pulling out activities

988
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,880
so some of these because of the way we

989
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,160
are extracting it and organizing it it's

990
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,920
easy to fish out these hallucinations

991
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,920
from our data

992
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,319
set um I was wondering

993
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,599
for Tom work in

994
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,599
the where

995
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,599
you

996
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:57,920
differences opportunities

997
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,920
or collaborators potentially growing in

998
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,599
different environments seeing if

999
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,079
there yeah we wrote a project with Andre

1000
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,318
Kesler it was not funded but essentially

1001
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,720
uh that was the goal we wanted to do

1002
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,400
reciprocal transplants in Peru and

1003
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,439
Ecuador and see if that has any adapter

1004
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,680
significance uh looking at at the

1005
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,920
transcriptome level and uh transcript

1006
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,118
metabolome and the phenotype actually if

1007
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:29,119
if there is any adaptive

1008
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,119
differences yeah but think get find

1009
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,199
anyone not morphological or other

1010
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:37,039
differences between those two

1011
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:39,679
subpopulations yeah the leaf leaf there

1012
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:44,318
is there Leaf differences there are uh

1013
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:46,679
differences in the growth habits uh

1014
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:52,400
yeah thank

1015
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:54,239
you just question about how what is the

1016
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,160
time frame that it takes these things

1017
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,679
tool

1018
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:04,318
you have any idea you know he said

1019
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:06,399
Thousand Years million years or uh I

1020
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,440
think Jacob was here he would have been

1021
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,800
in a better position to answer this

1022
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,599
question uh we we are trying to do some

1023
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,559
you know uh organ or get some insights

1024
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,200
on on the time scales for these events

1025
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:24,440
but we couldn't do that because of uh

1026
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:28,159
the insufficient data but uh I don't

1027
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:31,519
know the the the two species penilia and

1028
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,879
Hite is divers about 3 million years ago

1029
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:37,039
plus or minus 2 million

1030
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:40,838
years from each other so it happened in

1031
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:43,679
the last million or so years

1032
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:46,599
um it depends on the selection pressure

1033
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:51,960
right you could have the the traditional

1034
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:53,760
b b example the the the wings of the uh

1035
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,920
of the Butterflies changing color

1036
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,400
because of the Industrial Revolution and

1037
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,599
those things those was happened in a

1038
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,720
couple of generations so it depends on

1039
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,480
the selection pressure and population

1040
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,519
size uh but I I I don't know in this

1041
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,719
case how much time it

1042
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,719
took thank

1043
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:22,639
you see you said there are no natural

1044
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:22,639
PES that just because there

1045
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:28,960
are

1046
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,960
EnV yeah the

1047
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:37,078
uh so there are some wireworm type uh

1048
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,760
insects or neod that we see uh when we

1049
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,760
grow sweet potatoes we see some holes

1050
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,440
inside the sweet potatoes and rodents

1051
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,240
are the biggest one they come and eat

1052
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,599
the form sweet potatoes quite a bit um

1053
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:51,959
but yeah mostly because it is Northern

1054
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:57,280
you don't see the traditional uh sweet

1055
00:45:51,960 --> 00:46:02,720
potato W or or ferium infections uh in

1056
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,720
uh or um the S vills are not found

1057
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:11,079
here this has been a production of

1058
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:14,078
Cornell University on the web at

1059
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,079
