1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,799
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,799
University.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,440
Thank you everybody. I'm stunned by the

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,839
turnout here and I hope I will do the uh

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,519
your expectations

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:22,800
justice. When Angela got in contact with

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,839
me, she asked for something that would

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,439
stimulate discussion and and obviously

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,879
would have something to do with soils

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,238
and carbon cycling.

11
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,960
So the the

12
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:40,959
general thrust that I chose is this old

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,439
thing that we all um learn at the very

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,399
beginning of our scientific careers.

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:50,799
This be careful with correlations. I

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,120
think uh that that is this this mantra

17
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,878
that that is very early in our

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,119
scientific education as a maybe maybe

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,960
the data look good but but always be

20
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,878
mindful that you need to have some sort

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,478
of underlying explanation and I thought

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,118
uh I use this as the framework for uh

23
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,959
what I actually want to get across so I

24
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,359
don't want to tell you that you need to

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,438
be careful with

26
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,920
correlations it May it may look like I

27
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,478
was going to do that over the next let

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,000
me say five or six slides but don't

29
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:30,359
don't don't fall into that

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,280
trap. So what do I want to talk about?

31
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:39,239
Um first of all

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:43,400
uh the the talk about carbon cycling is

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:47,118
um replete with the use of this word

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,759
control and it it pays to think for a

35
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,438
moment what what a control is. So when

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,359
you want to know what a what a word

37
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,639
means you go to the dictionary don't

38
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,680
you? And uh when you go do that then you

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,439
find that a control is defined as the

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,040
power to make decisions or the ability

41
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,439
to direct actions

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,000
or an action itself or a method a law

43
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,639
that limits the amount or growth of

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,959
something. So a control is perceived as

45
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:22,439
something that is

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,920
actively doing something. Uh when

47
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:30,318
we accept

48
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:33,039
this choice of definitions, then uh we

49
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,079
we are immediately aware of the

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:40,799
relatively complicated nature of this

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,480
um thing control.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
When we have actions, decisions,

53
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,399
methods, laws, abilities, then we have

54
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,479
to accept that this this this entity,

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
this this this concept of control is

56
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,518
variable, dynamic, adaptive, structured,

57
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,360
multifaced. I could go on uh and you

58
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
know, if

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,599
I put a little effort into this. So what

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
I what

61
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:07,039
I'm trying to get across here is

62
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,959
controls are not single numeric values.

63
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,598
one

64
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,800
number is not a control or even a

65
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,639
sequence of numbers is not a control. Uh

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
and and even simple mathematical

67
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,000
functions or algorithms do not qualify

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,480
as

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,719
controls. Always when you follow that

70
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:31,518
Mariam Webster definition. So now let's

71
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:35,680
try to find the connection back to

72
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,280
carbon cycling. Um when people talk

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,879
about carbon cycling and when they model

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,640
carbon cycling then they often use

75
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:46,479
controls with the

76
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,639
um with the interesting development that

77
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,798
they multiply over the years or the the

78
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,878
controls that are being talked about

79
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,120
increase in number. Uh we can broadly

80
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,438
dist distinguish environmental controls

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,158
which include drivers such as moisture,

82
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:07,280
precipitation, radiation. Uh heat is a

83
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:10,479
form of radiation. But there's also uh

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,199
visible light uh ultraviolet light, high

85
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,319
energy radiation that might be ionizing.

86
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,599
Structure of the

87
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,279
environment can be parameterized as

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,199
total pore space, poor size

89
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,799
distribution, preferential flow paths,

90
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,040
mineral surface chemistry, resources. So

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
all these are environmental factors that

92
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,720
are known to have an influence on the

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,000
cycling of carbon, oxygen availability,

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,560
you take the oxygen away and things slow

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,639
down dramatically. uh alternate electron

96
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,439
acceptors. You take the oxygen away but

97
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,600
you provide nitrate and things keep

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,918
going at least for a larger part of the

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
microbial community. Proton

100
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,799
concentration other words for pH

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,918
catalytic metals organic co- metabolites

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:03,280
that will return mineralborn nutrients.

103
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:05,478
So something in the order of 11 or 12

104
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:09,439
environmental

105
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:13,120
controls, substrate controls. So the the

106
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:16,000
this refers to the fact that the the

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,399
object of decomposition has certain

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,038
properties which tend to um be of of

109
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,679
relevance for the decomposition process.

110
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,199
So which are these properties?

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,800
Bioenergetic potential. How much energy

112
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,520
is stored in that organic molecule? Uh

113
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,319
how attractive is it from an energy

114
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,799
viewpoint to the

115
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,000
decomposer? Oxidation state of the

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,680
carbon mainly. This is a important

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,720
variable that determines how difficult

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,560
it is to get at that energy. But then

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
also we we are not just decomposing

120
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,160
things for energy, not us and not the

121
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,080
microbes. we sometimes need nutrients

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,360
and in in in that case the stochometry

123
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,519
of the nutrients is important. Uh and

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,639
and this not just for the the big ones

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:10,758
the big uh mass nutrients but also for a

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,600
plethora of

127
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,600
micronutrients

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,360
assimilability. So

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,600
your your your compound may be um loaded

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,639
with energy, contain tons of nutrients,

131
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,280
but it may have some other feature that

132
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,918
prevents it from being

133
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:32,638
assimilated. One one really important uh

134
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:36,000
number here is molecular size. When we

135
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,680
go above 600 Dton, we get into real

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
problems getting this compound through

137
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,319
the cell wall from the outside to the

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,279
inside. And uh the the way these these

139
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,160
things are done in nature means that

140
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,119
threadlike molecules have are much

141
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,160
easier to taken in.

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,478
So but not everything's a threat and

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,439
this is what we mean with assimilability

144
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:05,839
and parametric

145
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,240
uh expressions of assimilability can be

146
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,198
aquous solubility molecular size

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,960
linearity global structure all these all

148
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,759
these features

149
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,719
influence control uh organic matter

150
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,479
turnover accessibility where is it is it

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
far removed from the decomposer or is it

152
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,959
closed by is it co-precipitated with a

153
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
mineral phase kind of mired in in

154
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,399
concrete? Uh is it absorbed encapsulated

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,280
in aggregate?

156
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:41,038
Um and that's another dozen or so

157
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,399
individual controls that we know have

158
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:47,038
something have the power to influence

159
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:50,519
the turnover of carbon. So, and I'm not

160
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,800
done yet. organismic. So the yeah the

161
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,359
decomposers the those who are actually

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,720
doing the business they have different

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,720
lifestyles grazers predators microisal

164
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,360
free living fungi bacteria aa microbial

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,000

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,000
the microbial community how many of them

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,839
are

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,319
there how active are they are they all

169
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,598
dormant uh or are they competing with

170
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
each other massively are they

171
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,038
synergistic are they cheetahs

172
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,799
There is such there is such a

173
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:26,519
thing. Those who lie and wait for others

174
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,840
to secrete all the expensive enzymes

175
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:32,958
and growth stage

176
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,799
um physiology of microbes and especially

177
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,799
the the chemistry of the extracellular

178
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,799
polymeric substances that they secrete

179
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,918
change as a function of growth stage

180
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,719
within ours.

181
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,399
ability to use oxygen. That's the that's

182
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
our this is the second most

183
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,679
electronegative element in the periodic

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,639
table. And it's the the strongest

185
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,719
electron catcher. When you have a system

186
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,799
that contains oxygen, you can make these

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
large energy gradients that really drive

188
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,919
things. And when you when you cannot

189
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,559
take advantage of this and your energy

190
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
gradient is only like that, such as

191
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,039
between your substrate and iron, for

192
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:13,039
example, then the energy that you can

193
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,799
harvest is much smaller. So you you if

194
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,240
you really want to have things turn over

195
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:22,000
quickly, you want to have

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,278
oxygen and that uh is reflected in the

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,399
biology of the of the decomposers. So

198
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,559
some of them uh are really specialized

199
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
on this that but others once in a while

200
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,879
we run out of oxygen and then you have

201
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,360
uh those who are

202
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,838
absolutely unable to deal with oxygen

203
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,959
organisms that probably are somewhat

204
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,480
left over from the days two or three

205
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,199
billion years ago when there was no

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,720
oxygen free oxygen but then there's all

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,320
kinds of integrates here. So,

208
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,320
so, so what what I have here is

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,240
something in the order of 30

210
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,839
or if if we were to engage in a

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,399
collective brainstorm, we would be able

212
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,480
to come up with another 10 or 20 within

213
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,559
15 minutes, I'm pretty sure.

214
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,959
So, the challenge then is to how do we

215
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,559
constrain this? What

216
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:18,639
matters? Who or what controls the

217
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,639
control?

218
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,679
Is there a hierarchy of

219
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:30,319
relevance? Do they depend on each

220
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:35,039
other? Uh is is is the control number

221
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,399
seven uh of the same importance in uh

222
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,000
Cornell as it is in

223
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,000
Corvalis and in the reactive the

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,919
respective soils of course. So how have

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,240
people dealt with this? I mean we are

226
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,199
not we are not the first who who realize

227
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
this this multitude of

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,879
possibilities. Uh so others before us

229
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
have realized the same thing and they

230
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,200
have developed strategies how to deal

231
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,560
with this and one of the strategies was

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,278
the idea to look for a master control

233
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:14,000
for one parameter or for one

234
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:14,000
item that controls it all. the one

235
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:21,199
ring and that one ring the first big

236
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:24,599
popular one ring is what we call

237
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,440
substrate quality. That's that's the the

238
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,680
first suggest just suggestion of a

239
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,600
useful master control that

240
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,039
uh was extensively tested by the

241
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,680
scientific community.

242
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:42,159
So I'm I'm presenting two examples for

243
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,958
the application of this principle of of

244
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:48,319
uh substrate quality in the function of

245
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,399
a master control. You probably have all

246
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
at some point heard something about umic

247
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
substances and there is a paradigm

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
that's still standing paradigm that

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,160
these umic substances tend to have old

250
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,040
radiocarbon age because there is a

251
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,439
process that is called humification

252
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,278
which makes them highly

253
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,360
aromatic. And this then explains their

254
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,200
resistance to

255
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,278
decomposition which explains the the

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,240
high

257
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:19,159
radiocarbonate. And this goes back to uh

258
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,759
a benchmark paper published in

259
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:25,439
1967. So it is needs a little

260
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:29,200
explanation. So you have a a graph with

261
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,959
age on this axis. High age is here 1500

262
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,200
years. The numbers are bit bit small but

263
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:39,039
um so old carbon is here and this is

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,160
1500 years 1,500 years. And then you

265
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:46,000
have an an a a a uh index for

266
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:49,159
aromaticity. This is the the the ratio

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,278
of the light extinction at 400 and 600

268
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:56,879
nanometers. This uh this is a a way of

269
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:59,799
determining how many aromatic compounds

270
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:04,639
are in that specific

271
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:07,838
uh solution. So when you are high on

272
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:11,360
this axis the aromaticity is low and

273
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,959
when you are high on this axis the the

274
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,720
carbon is old. So so

275
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:23,119
the the young carbon or the young age is

276
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:27,879
following this red line and the the that

277
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,480
age gets older as the aromaticity goes

278
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,838
down increases. I'm sorry the the the

279
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,920
brown line goes down but that means the

280
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
aromaticity increases. I'm was

281
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,599
practicing this for a couple of times

282
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
and I wasn't

283
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,278
so at at this point I want to come back

284
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,440
to my little introductory remark about

285
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:53,519
the importance of correlation uh and uh

286
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,839
our our joint love for correlations. We

287
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,399
all when we see something correlate like

288
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,440
this the the age goes up when

289
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,399
aromaticity goes

290
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,639
up then we all love this. We cannot we

291
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,600
cannot avoid that. We we we really like

292
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,759
this type of observation. And what we do

293
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:21,000
then is we we inadvertently

294
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,360
instantly in invent a model some sort of

295
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,440
explanation. And in this case, the

296
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,879
explanation was was really plausible um

297
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,360
because we know that aromatic rings

298
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,198
require a lot of activation energy to

299
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,759
break

300
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:41,039
them. So it makes it makes total sense

301
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,319
for these two parameters age and

302
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,679
aromaticity to

303
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,360
correlate. But in order to to

304
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:53,120
demonstrate that they do indeed causally

305
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,879
uh generate this resistance to

306
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
decomposition, one would have to

307
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,439
demonstrate

308
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,039
that. And

309
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,519
uh actually went one sentence ahead of

310
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,879
myself here. I was I was going to u uh

311
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
mention that this is these ages here.

312
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,399
This is what we in carbon cycling models

313
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,360
consider the passive pool. You probably

314
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
have heard about the active, the

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,240
intermediate or slow and then the

316
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,720
passive pool. So this is this is what

317
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:30,519
gave rise to this passive pool idea 1,

318
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,800
1,500 years of turnover

319
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,278
time. So what are the issues with

320
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,120
causality here? This this was accepted

321
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,919
an accepted relationship and it was an

322
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,198
accepted is still an accepted model.

323
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,039
This type of inference informs the

324
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,919
community land model which is supported

325
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,120
by NSF and DOE and which is the basis of

326
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,838
climate modeling at this time as we

327
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,679
speak. So what is the issue with

328
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,000
causality? So I'm saying that the ideas

329
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:04,120
behind the the correlations used in the

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,278
existing CLM are not based on causality.

331
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,198
can

332
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,320
um decomposer organ organisms have no

333
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:16,399
way to sense how much 14 C or 13C is in

334
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:20,399
a glucose or in a uh a lipid. Uh they

335
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,679
cannot make a a selection based on 14 C

336
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,679
content or 13 C content. They recognize

337
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,599
the glucose or they recognize the lipid

338
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,439
and then they decide whether they want

339
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,320
to engage. So old age is not an argument

340
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
for stability.

341
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,479
It it it were an argument for stability

342
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,120
if the decomposer would have a mechanism

343
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
to select for young versus old which

344
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,120
they don't. They go for chemical

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,078
characteristic and not for radiocarbon

346
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,919
content or 13C

347
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,758
content. Fungi are absolutely capable of

348
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,519
decomposing condensed aromatic rings.

349
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
There's a huge literature and I I I did

350
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,078
just did not put it up. you just Google

351
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,279
P ages and fungi and you you get 10,000

352
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,678
hits or

353
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,279
something. So the the mechanistics me

354
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,798
mechanistic assumptions behind that

355
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,399
little logical chain that I had on the

356
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,400
previous slide are not

357
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,240
corroborated. The the other thing or the

358
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,759
third major argument here is the early

359
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,919
researchers were working in Canadian

360
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,079
grassland soils. grassland

361
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,240
soils and they had an important piece of

362
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,240
information they did not have that we

363
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,319
have it

364
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,079
today. Uh so

365
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:41,798
they see this 14 is a function of

366
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:44,079
aromaticity and they don't know a

367
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,480
important feature of these grassland

368
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,399
soils that we know today. And what is

369
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
that

370
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,519
feature? the the aromaticity in these

371
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,480
soils does not come from whatever that

372
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,918
humification process

373
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,759
represents. It was supposed to be here

374
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,919
the

375
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:05,038
map. So you have these grassland soils

376
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,400
which are zonal soils. They are all uh

377
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,679
uh along uh

378
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,080
the some somewhere between the 20th and

379
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,559
the and the 50th parallel. Actually a

380
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:18,639
few down here in Argentina as well. Uh

381
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,639
this is a a map using the FAO soil

382
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,600
systematic. So it has the f theoss,

383
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,320
shooms, castinos. These soils are

384
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,639
broadly equivalent to the salt taxonomy

385
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,558
molly

386
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,480
souls.

387
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:35,279
Um these grasslands in their native

388
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,759
state, they burn regularly and that

389
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,160
loads them up with black carbon. BC

390
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,480
means black carbon. So here's the data.

391
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,840
So the this study is based on 28 soil

392
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:52,079
profiles very uh rigorously investigated

393
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:55,918
with radiocarbon 13C uh markers for

394
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,678
black carbon and you find that there is

395
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,038
something of the line was not drawn here

396
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
but there's something of a correlation

397
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,240
between the black carbon in grassland

398
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
soils and the carbon stock in these

399
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,960
soils and the the takeaway message here

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,960
is that grassland soils contain between

401
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
1 and 5 kilog kilogram of black carbon

402
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,240
which is more or less a a a

403
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,160
concentration of aromatic

404
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,240
rings.

405
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,558
So we are we are facing a long-standing

406
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,519
paradigm and there is abundant evidence

407
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,000
that the mechanistic underpinnings

408
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,480
uh are no longer valid. Let me put it

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,759
that

410
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,640
way. Oh yeah and this was published by

411
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:40,798
Rodenov in 2010.

412
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,038
So, so let's leave the the long the slow

413
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,960
pool, the thousand-year pool uh behind

414
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:51,359
for a moment. Um there's another example

415
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,038
of this attempt to to use a master

416
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,558
control to describe carbon turnover and

417
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,319
that is the paradigm that litter

418
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,879
decomposition rate should be a function

419
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:04,279
of the lignon nitrogen ratio.

420
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,440
Um this is a

421
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,558
absolute citation classic here. Milo uh

422
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,038
at at all

423
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:16,279
1982 and and this was the work where it

424
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:22,000
was shown for the first time

425
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:24,558
that the the biomass remaining after you

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,640
expose litter for a certain amount of

427
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:31,240
time or let it decompose. The amount of

428
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,240
litter that remains after time X is a

429
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,480
function of lignen nitrogen ratio.

430
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,640
Basically you have high nitrogen the

431
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,120
litter is decomposed quickly and you

432
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,320
have low nitrogen or the inverse is uh

433
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:50,839
little lingine high lignine then uh the

434
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:55,399
litter goes away uh uh much slower.

435
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:57,000
So which leads to this uh this general

436
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,440
um

437
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,200
paradigmatic statement that liter

438
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,360
decompositions depends on lignine

439
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,360
content. There is one one caution that

440
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,759
one should immediately become aware of

441
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,558
when one looks at this graph. So if this

442
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,879
is a categorical predictor then the

443
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,879
green and the blue should be on top of

444
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,080
each other. But apparently this

445
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,240
relationship can be modified and here we

446
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,319
we run into this issue with our

447
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,240
assumption that a master control may

448
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,678
help us to get a handle on the multitude

449
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,558
of controls. Um if for whatever reason I

450
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,720
want to be able to distinguish between

451
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,440
ecosystems apparently just one control

452
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:42,079
is not going to carry the

453
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,080
day. So this is by by the way uh the the

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,279
the experimental evidence that gave rise

455
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,360
to this idea that we should have a

456
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,200
slowpool in carbon cycle models. So

457
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,399
because this this type of material turns

458
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,279
over on an annual multi-annual time

459
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,280
scale 10

460
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:04,400
20

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,319
the the issue with this is not only that

462
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,159
the green and the blue were not on top

463
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:13,038
of each other. The issue is also that

464
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,440
um the this this old assumption lignen

465
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,919
is only decomposed after the label or n

466
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,200
containing organics have been used up.

467
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,360
So this is the the this this back and

468
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
staff 1980

469
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,119
uh this litter decomposition model. So

470
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,798
you have the mass of the litter the blue

471
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:34,639
line mass on this axis time on this

472
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:37,599
axis. As as time progresses, the litter

473
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,880
comes down, the mass comes down. And the

474
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,319
the underlying idea verbalized here was

475
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:48,159
that the lignon doesn't

476
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:50,158
respond until the the uh label stuff

477
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,000
which would be the area under this curve

478
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,760
here under until that that is uh

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,759
decomposed. So the idea the bugs or the

480
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,919
decomposers go for the easy stuff first

481
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,919
and then they have used that up then

482
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,240
they eat the basically they eat the

483
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:11,720
candy and then they go for the potatoes.

484
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,720
So and and and

485
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:18,240
um again this is this is somewhat

486
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,240
plausible because it it is in line with

487
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
some of our own behavior. Just was

488
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,159
talking about the candy and the Yeah.

489
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,679
No, this is we we have evidence that

490
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,520
processes of this kind can work in this

491
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,240
in this fashion. But is it is it

492
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,558
actually what is going on

493
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,679
here? And then there is new research

494
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:43,918
that shows vigorous enigma decomposition

495
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,919
is going on only as long as there are

496
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,080
these

497
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:51,759
easily decomposible things. So the the

498
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,038
the mass loss now again the litter mass

499
00:23:51,759 --> 00:24:00,279
loss the whole litter mass loss uh

500
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:03,359
described by the blue line but the the

501
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,480
lignon gets decomposed here at the at at

502
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:09,678
the front when you have these things in

503
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,400
order to help decompose the lignon but

504
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,640
when you run out of the accessory the

505
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,120
so-called co-

506
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,640
metabolites then the resources to to to

507
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,719
do business with the lignine are no

508
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,200
longer there and then the the line

509
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
flattens

510
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:32,240
out published in

511
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:35,119
2011. So and the the old model 1980 so

512
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,558
it's 30 years and new evidence has come

513
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,359
around. In both cases, it's it's not my

514
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:44,079
intention to to criticize the the our

515
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:48,000
predecessors, but it's my my intention

516
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,480
is rather to to point at the need to uh

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,558
be careful with these

518
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:57,599
correlations and uh don't trust them too

519
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:59,599
much. Uh because if we do do, we might

520
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,399
miss the the things that are really

521
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:05,399
going on. So yeah, and I was going to

522
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,120
point that out, which I believe I did.

523
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,720
So is

524
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:14,158
substrate quality an appropriate master

525
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,679
control? Well, based on the evidence I

526
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:22,159
have just presented, I hope you uh can

527
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,798
uh join me in saying that is probably

528
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,799
um not

529
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:30,639
so. And if if that is not so then um is

530
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,200
there is there maybe some other master

531
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,559
control? And here we come to work that

532
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,159
was published in 1988 81. So large

533
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,079
differences between the turnover rate of

534
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,320
particular compounds in liquid microbial

535
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,000
cultures and in

536
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:46,278
soil indicate that soil provides a

537
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
measurable degree of protection. So the

538
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:53,599
the those who set out to get a handle on

539
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,839
the controls focused on the substrate

540
00:25:53,599 --> 00:26:00,079
and uh but then somebody

541
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,639
realized the the soil controls the

542
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,918
matrix of the soil controls decomposer

543
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,600
as de decomposition as well. So you have

544
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,799
you may have the substrate somewhere

545
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,278
here but then uh it matters what kind of

546
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,038
matrix this substrate interacts with if

547
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,278
at all.

548
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,879
Interestingly, look at that

549
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,880
date that that that kind of thinking

550
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,000
came around more or less at the same

551
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,919
time. But the substrate control idea was

552
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,519
way more uh appealing to the scientific

553
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,960
community. Liked it much better. Didn't

554
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,599
really want to deal with this matrix and

555
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,240
mineral stuff for a while at least. So

556
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,959
until

557
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,359
1997, Margaret, my former boss, uh was

558
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,480
lucky with a Nature paper that was

559
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:51,199
titled mineral control of soil organic

560
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,720
carbon storage and turnover. So this

561
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,720
this then is an example for for

562
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,558
uh an attempt to address some of the

563
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,038
shortcomings that the substrate quality

564
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:08,278
idea had by replacing it with a better

565
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,038
master

566
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:15,119
control. Problem with that approach was

567
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:19,440
that it's not exactly a straightforward

568
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:23,558
predictor either. So and it would be so

569
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,240
uh the the uh if you

570
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,079
take mineral components from three

571
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,839
different soils here this is the clay

572
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,599
fraction uh then you you have to uh

573
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,319
accept that the ability of clays to

574
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,359
associate with carbon is much different

575
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,278
between the soils. So you can just say

576
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,000
which actually the the century model

577
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,240
does uh I take clay content and use that

578
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,519
as a rate modifier. It matters a lot

579
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,519
what kind of clay you have in

580
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:58,439
there. So what do we make out of this?

581
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:01,840
What's what where do we go from here?

582
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,080
Um a contest of the master controls does

583
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,480
not seem to be the best strategy here.

584
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,558
So remember in the beginning I I took

585
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
some time to show that there is no

586
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,278
problem to come up with at least 30 or

587
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,278
40 individual

588
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,558
um factors that would qualify as some

589
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,360
sort of control. So picking one and and

590
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:27,639
focusing on one of these controls is is

591
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:31,599
not apparently not the best strategy.

592
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,840
Um and be why because in both cases the

593
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,798
evidence in support for the importance

594
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,959
of that control was largely

595
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:41,000
correlative. The

596
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,000
it the the

597
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,359
researchers saw this correlation the

598
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,960
lignen nitrogen ratio and the uh the

599
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,719
amount of of litter left perfect you

600
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
know straight line. you you go out do

601
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,720
some experiments out there and and you

602
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,918
have 10 data points and you get a

603
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,159
straight line. How often does that

604
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,600
happen? It must mean something, doesn't

605
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,600
it? Yeah.

606
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,798
And but but the fascination with this

607
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,720
type of of result

608
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:15,519
then makes us makes us so confident that

609
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,919
we do not dig deeper.

610
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,839
So are we doing enough to identify and

611
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,679
understand mechanisms and causes behind

612
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,240
assumptions that we use to inform carbon

613
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,360
cycle models? I'm positing here we are

614
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,079
not and you are the generation that has

615
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,079
to change

616
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,320
that brings up the issue of

617
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,720
causality. So how do we get at causality

618
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:44,319
in carbon cycling? But what what what

619
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,519
are ways to uh make this work? So the

620
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,439
controls actually are

621
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,480
descriptors. The the thing that we need

622
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,720
to understand we we don't need another

623
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,759
label. We already have 30 or

624
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,919
40. What what we need is understanding

625
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:06,720
of the system, the machine, the

626
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,600
engine, reciprocating our turbine. That

627
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,480
that type of understanding is what we

628
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:15,519
need. And a good way to approach this or

629
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,519
the way that I am to I am I am proposing

630
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,879
here is uh to look for where the soil

631
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,639
comes from evolutionary

632
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,440
adaptations. So the number relevance

633
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,159
connectivity of controls our 30 catalog

634
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,558
of 30 controls can they be seen as a

635
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,200
consequence of systems design which

636
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,918
would have if if this in any way works

637
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,960
out it it would mean if you get an idea

638
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:46,320
of the principles behind systems design.

639
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:49,600
How how is the the soil as a uh uh a

640
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:53,119
place where carbon is processed? How how

641
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:55,439
is that designed? how is it laid out?

642
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,359
What are the guiding principles? If if

643
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,798
we know that we may be able to get at

644
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,199
the causalities that we are missing in

645
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,200
these old

646
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
correlations.

647
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:12,639
So what what I'm saying here is in

648
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,038
disagreement with the the views that

649
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:21,080
geologists have about soils.

650
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:24,640
Geologists uh uh take soils as the the

651
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:27,519
the interface between a planetary body

652
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,159
and what is beyond and they do not

653
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,759
require life to be involved in the

654
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,360
formation of soil. This understanding of

655
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:40,278
soil when I say soil evolves with the

656
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,759
ecosystem goes back to this idea

657
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:48,880
of that burner. I'm I'm sure others as

658
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:51,599
well have uh put forward that when soil

659
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,399
formation really took off on this planet

660
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,319
when plants started to evolve when when

661
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,959
the algae came out of the water and

662
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,918
inhabited the land that is the moment

663
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,759
where we should start talking about

664
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:09,600
soils.

665
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:13,038
So if we follow that premise and again

666
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,839
uh the the the geology community folks

667
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,759
who like to find soils on Mars they they

668
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,879
have to do without trees and out roots

669
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,398
and so that's a different view of

670
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,559
things. Evolution has created flow

671
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,558
through reactor systems with unique

672
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,119
reactor design and carbon processing

673
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,599
strategies. So that would be the causal

674
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,038
the key to

675
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:36,079
causality reactor design carbon

676
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:39,599
processing strategies. So something like

677
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:43,199
400 million years ago a few algae

678
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,439
started to inhabit the land surface. The

679
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,200
these little algae evolved into proto

680
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,399
plants which uh developed proto roots

681
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,798
which by the way from the first day were

682
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,319
uh working together with microisal fungi

683
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,398
and with bacteria because they were

684
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:03,200
there first. And so as a result the

685
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,199
matrix gets transformed and when you

686
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,640
allow the plants to become more

687
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,159
complicated and more powerful as

688
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:14,159
biogeeochemical machines then you get

689
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,880
these systems and it is relatively

690
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,840
uh easy

691
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,919
to um envision

692
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:25,599
that when you change the ecosystem here

693
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,840
that would have effects on uh how the

694
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,119
soil is is functioning They have

695
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,759
different inputs. You have different

696
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,558
quantities of inputs. You probably have

697
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:36,398
a other uh biota. And so you get a

698
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,519
different type of reactor design and

699
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,518
different carbon processing

700
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,519
strategies. That now means the controls

701
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,798
are the result of how the the system

702
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,159
works. You don't approach the problem by

703
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,440
asking what does temperature do to the

704
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,559
system. You approach the problem by

705
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,080
saying how does the system work? Oh, if

706
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,240
I raise the temperature to 50 degrees,

707
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:05,558
that means such and such. So, it's a

708
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:08,559
it's a a a reversal of the the line of

709
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,398
thinking. The basis for this is the the

710
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,159
fact that within any ecosystem, there's

711
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,118
co-evolution of above ground and below

712
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,159
ground

713
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:20,720
biota. The decomposers are there because

714
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,519
of the plants. That's the idea behind

715
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,319
this. And it's not my idea. It's

716
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,918
Eastwood at all. the interesting paper

717
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,679
the the science paper is only four or

718
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,838
five pages but the supplementary

719
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,878
information are I believe 70

720
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,759
so you

721
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:42,078
really so this

722
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,079
is if soils evolve to decompose organic

723
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,119
carbon at the rates and in the sequences

724
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,519
required to support the

725
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:54,079
ecosystem that that puts into question

726
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:57,039
ideas like uh oh I have a uh certain

727
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,440
lignos cellulose that should decompose

728
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,199
at a rate that is typical for lignos

729
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,079
cellulose. That's what our models do

730
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:07,078
right now 76 days lignos cellulose if

731
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,560
the

732
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,680
system has evolved in a to deal with

733
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,759
lignos cellulose in a certain way then

734
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,679
the system determines the

735
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,640
characteristics of the system determine

736
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,719
how long this lignoselos takes to be

737
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,000
decomposed. So it's no longer an

738
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,159
inherent property of the lingo

739
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,838
cellulose.

740
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,759
So system evolution here is a a dune in

741
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,358
beautiful

742
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,640
Oregon and this is grat student Adrian

743
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:39,440
Gallo taking a picture and only about

744
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,759
500 meters away from this dune is a

745
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,760
older dune and you see how that soil has

746
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,680
evolved has shown some some uh E horizon

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:54,240
ABS horizon so that's an incipient

748
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,838
uh spot sooul this is a very uh early

749
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,639
antisol

750
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,880
And in the course of this development

751
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,639
the is there's change of the mineral

752
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,280
matrix. It's consumed. Minerals are

753
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:09,440
destroyed. Uh new minerals are formed

754
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,640
and things are rearranged in the soil.

755
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,480
Structure is changed. So so the reactor

756
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,920
design this is a different reactor than

757
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,519
this. It does different

758
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,358
things and that those things that they

759
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,960
that are happening different here

760
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,679
influence the turnover time of the

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,679
organic

762
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,679
matter.

763
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:37,519
Oops. Yeah. This this whole matrix issue

764
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:40,358
must be seen not as a static entity but

765
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,960
as a dynamic adaptive part of the

766
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:46,960
ecosystem. So the the mineral matrix is

767
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,199
actually shaped by the biota.

768
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,480
which is which is the the major force

769
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:55,838
that that makes the soils function in

770
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,880
different ways. So a a very crude uh

771
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:03,519
idea of how this works is you need

772
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,240
water. We uh all agree with this water

773
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,960
comes slightly acidic because you have

774
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,399
CO2 in the in the air which dissolves in

775
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,800
the water and that makes it mild acid.

776
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,160
This then allows for weathering of the

777
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,640
minerals. You can have small reactive

778
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,639
weathering products and then they can be

779
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,039
mineral partners of mineral organic

780
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,279
associations and the intensity along

781
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:31,559
this

782
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:35,280
path varies. what you get here. Uh

783
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:38,639
moisture also allows things to grow,

784
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,040
microbes and plants and then when when

785
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,838
plants grow for example they generate

786
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:48,358
root exodates which are

787
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:51,920
acidic really acidic and that then uh uh

788
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:54,319
augments or or amplifies processes down

789
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,039
here. So you have more growing here, you

790
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,480
have more change here. You get the you

791
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:07,559
get the idea. You you make

792
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,559
this a a a thriving active part. You get

793
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,960
uh I have the bad word here humis uh

794
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,960
because it's in every book. This can be

795
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,960
decomposed and you again making

796
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,519
something acidic and this again then

797
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,760
influences the the the properties and

798
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:27,838
the shape of the mir. a highly dynamic

799
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,079
system. Uh you take vegetation out, you

800
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,920
change the intensity of processes, you

801
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,480
mess with the microorganisms, you change

802
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,800
the intensity of processes.

803
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,838
And it should it should illustrate the

804
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,200
the contention that this is not very

805
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:47,000
well predicted or described by saying

806
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,719
lignen

807
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,400
or cellulose are are decomposed within

808
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,000
50 days. So yeah, I I I change the

809
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,838
importance of any of these arrows and

810
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,880
that number will not uh

811
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:05,440
uh have any any

812
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,760
uh uh connection with reality. So where

813
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,358
are we? Current research practice is

814
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,119
centered on understanding controls and

815
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,400
their

816
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,200
interactions which can be paraphrased as

817
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,480
understand the control to understand the

818
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,480
system. That is how we all have been

819
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,280
brought up. This is how how our modelers

820
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,679
work. They they want us to figure out

821
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,040
how a a algorithm that describes how the

822
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:31,759
control equation influences turnover

823
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,358
time. But would it not be better if we

824
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,880
accept that controls and their relative

825
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,159
importance evolve with a system to put

826
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,760
more effort into understanding systems

827
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:44,480
design

828
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,240
and such in in a way that we can derive

829
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,000
the relative importance of controls for

830
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,399
the governance of the system. that would

831
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,880
turn the thing around understand the

832
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,440
system in order to understand the

833
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,160
importance of the control. So if you are

834
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,880
interested in temperature sensitivity of

835
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,440
organic matter decay well you need to

836
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,680
understand how decay works and then you

837
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,240
will be able to understand what happens

838
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,598
when you manipulate the temperature.

839
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,719
the the way we are approaching this

840
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,720
right now is from the other

841
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:21,759
end systems design. So what does that

842
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,400
mean? Soils are different. So like I

843
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,960
just said u in koalas we have different

844
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,119
soils than you guys have here. So there

845
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,079
is a uh an obvious difference between

846
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,160
soil type but even within one soil you

847
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,200
can uh identify regions where the the

848
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,279
process regime is completely

849
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:46,679
different. So let's look at the litter

850
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,920
layer here. Uh this is a loose pile of

851
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:52,559
substrate like walking into uh Starbucks

852
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,559
in the morning. Everything's there. You

853
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,880
just grab it. well

854
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:02,000
airrated oxygen plenty. No need to come

855
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,720
up with any fancy physiology or so. Uh

856
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,239
easily accessible to mobile decomposers.

857
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:10,559
Yeah. The the a a a force that we tend

858
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,519
to forget very frequently. Meoporn are

859
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,078
those are the ones that chew the large

860
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,719
pieces down to the size where the bugs

861
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,640
can then do business. U so they are

862
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,639
abundant here. They can crawl among the

863
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,118
leaves and twigs and they and they are

864
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,279
fast. They are usually the first ones on

865
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,280
the

866
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,280
scene susceptible to perturbations and

867
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,598
to fluctuations of driver. A tree falls

868
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,160
down, crashes on the forest floor. All

869
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,318
this this little paradise is is uh

870
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:44,000
anihilated uh or it doesn't rain for 3

871
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,480
days, the the moisture holding capacity

872
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,800
is basically not existing. So it dries

873
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,000
out very so the amplitude ecological

874
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,039
amplitudes are large. You need

875
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,039
adaptations for that basically.

876
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,318
Let's go a little further down. A

877
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:04,279
horizon. This is actually the region uh

878
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:07,279
where you can say the

879
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,000
ecosystem does its recycling. So this is

880
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,319
the recycling facility of the ecosystem.

881
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,760
Um you have an active input of co-

882
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:18,639
metabolites through root exodates. So

883
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,160
the the plants they have they have no in

884
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,960
I mean plant cannot think and an

885
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:26,559
ecosystem does not evolve in a direction

886
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,400
chosen by the ecosystem. It's all

887
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,719
adaptive. So you excuse my language when

888
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,680
I say uh the plants can uh support

889
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,279
business by putting exodates out. There

890
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,000
are regulatory mechanisms that allow

891
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,519
them to do that is in in an adaptive

892
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,760
fashion. Um the the point is that as

893
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,440
long as you have these plant roots, fine

894
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,200
roots, you can really speed up things.

895
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,440
You you have you have something that is

896
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:58,078
absorbed and protected or it's it's a

897
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,559
large chunk. You can you can support uh

898
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,640
decomposition processes by by meta

899
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,119
inputs. You have a wide choice of

900
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,440
catabolic pathways. Everything's

901
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,440
everything's going here. uh you have

902
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,039
access to catalytic metals and reactive

903
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,720
surfaces because you're already in the

904
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,239
soil. You don't have that in the same

905
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,598
extent here in the litter layer because

906
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,838
you don't have the metals and you don't

907
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,200
have the

908
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:23,838
minerals and the the

909
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:25,519
the oscillations in oxygen supply are

910
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,960
somewhat dampened because the moisture

911
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,318
holding capacity here is much higher

912
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,800
than than here. Uh but it's it's it's

913
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,800
still it's still cycling. Once in a

914
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
while you go through a redux cycle and

915
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,760
you can recycle those redux sensitive

916
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,318
metals that you that you can use utilize

917
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,520
as

918
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,759
catalysts. Only when you get down here

919
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,599
then you are in the

920
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,440
desert. But that is again that qualifies

921
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,119
as a completely different operating

922
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,119
conditions condition for a reactor. Low

923
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,480
substrate

924
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,079
concentrations. A bit of substrate here,

925
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,000
a bit here, a bit here, a bit here and

926
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,720
the micro here in the center. How how is

927
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,800
this supposed to work? the the you

928
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,519
cannot do very quick organic matter

929
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,519
turnover under such conditions. U few

930
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,079
organisms lack of co metabolites because

931
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,559
no roots anymore reduced pore space

932
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,640
because often you have clay formation uh

933
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,759
at those depths and that will clog your

934
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:23,039
pores. Uh it's difficult to get oxygen

935
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,160
down there and you have uh the issues of

936
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,039
accessibility that I just pointed

937
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,480
out.

938
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,880
So this is what I mean with

939
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,199
understanding how the system works and

940
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,358
then ask yourself now when I am let's

941
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,519
say I am in this in this in this desert

942
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:43,519
in the in the in the subs soil and I put

943
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,960
a chunk of wood down there uh is is it

944
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,440
really appropriate to say this turns

945
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,280
over in 76

946
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,358
days as a as a as a substrate specific

947
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,280
parameter? I don't think so. So in our

948
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,719
zeal to understand controls on carbon

949
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,960
cycling are relying too much on

950
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,719
correlative evidence. Progress may come

951
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,720
from bottomup approaches that seek to

952
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,879
identify the causality that I'm giving

953
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:09,759
you here the what you already heard in

954
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,559
your u first statistics uh

955
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,079
uh class.

956
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,960
So what I what I really want to

957
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:21,119
emphasize

958
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,599
is it it's worth to to accept the fact

959
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,838
that soils do not just look different

960
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,000
but also work different especially when

961
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,920
it comes to carbon cycling. The next

962
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,318
generation of models and the next

963
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,400
generation of scientists needs to

964
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,318
emphasize the causalities behind soil

965
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,519
process. Don't do the same thing that

966
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,719
our fathers have done.

967
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,318
Now when you when you see that straight

968
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:48,159
line is that okay I have a straight line

969
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,440
great that is certainly going to be a

970
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,279
paper but be honest to yourself yeah be

971
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,838
honest to yourself do do I really

972
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,640
understand what's going on here have I

973
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,838
tested whether my assumption is really

974
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,799
the the mechanism behind this or am I am

975
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,239
I going the way of cheap sales and if

976
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,240
you're ever in a position to support

977
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,318
some sort of modeling exercise be

978
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:14,959
especially careful with the causalities

979
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:18,159
thing. Yeah, a a golden sentence to

980
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,760
conclude and uh yeah, paradigms must be

981
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,279
continuously challenged and checked for

982
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,920
compliance with coalis. Doesn't that

983
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,920
read beautiful? Okay, thank you for your

984
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,920
attention.

985
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:33,199
[Applause]

986
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,358
Well, I need to admit that I'm not a

987
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:40,399
modeler and uh I also need to admit that

988
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:42,719
I have enormous uh u confidence in uh

989
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,599
the the possibility of technological

990
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:48,959
advances. So I I remember that when I

991
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,680
entered the field 20 years ago um we

992
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,920
modeling model exercises were were done

993
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,679
on supercomputers. Today that's you

994
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,079
don't need them. One of the major

995
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,118
constraints was storage space at that

996
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,000
time and I understand these constraints

997
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,000
have gone down but I also remember that

998
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,358
the computational

999
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,838
uh complexity of models was an issue and

1000
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:15,480
so not knowing what the most recent

1001
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:19,599
developments in this field are. I think

1002
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:22,318
um the the argument that the models need

1003
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,800
to be simple which I completely

1004
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,039
understand and I think

1005
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,240
uh there is no reason to try to

1006
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:32,318
overexlain things. We we we know this

1007
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,239
from other phenomena. When you can

1008
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,318
explain something using three variables,

1009
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,559
then there is no need to throw 30

1010
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,480
variables into the picture. In fact,

1011
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,119
principal component analysis is a tool

1012
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,800
that we all often use to to bring down

1013
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,960
the number of variables because it's

1014
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,560
then easier to make sense of what we

1015
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,119
see.

1016
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,880
So um my attempt to talk around your

1017
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,900
question is now going on for one and a

1018
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,559
half

1019
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,720
[Laughter]

1020
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:07,358
minutes. Um but what you what you get

1021
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:12,480
from from this is I think uh there is

1022
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:15,598
probably some uh some slack in what on

1023
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,318
the computational side can be done. So I

1024
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,920
I think we should not be afraid uh to

1025
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:25,279
add parameters or add algorithms to our

1026
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,119
modeling attempts. Um but to what extent

1027
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,920
that can be realized is a little bit

1028
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,599
beyond my area of

1029
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,599
expertise that okay thank you.

1030
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,838
So I have

1031
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,839
friends, I have modeler friends and they

1032
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:48,480
have they have uh uh played with not

1033
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,639
just decomposing organic matter but

1034
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,039
breaking organic matter down into

1035
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,759
certain functional

1036
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:58,000
categories and that seemed to be a

1037
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,880
useful approach that has been published

1038
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,760
last year I think in geocientific model

1039
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,760
developments obscure

1040
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,880
uh journal. Yeah. So if if you are

1041
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,760
interested in detail, I I'm happy to

1042
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,358
share the source. Yeah.

1043
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,119
Thank you everyone. Let's thank Marcus

1044
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:18,078
again.

1045
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,480
Thank you.

1046
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:25,720
This has been a production of Cornell

1047
