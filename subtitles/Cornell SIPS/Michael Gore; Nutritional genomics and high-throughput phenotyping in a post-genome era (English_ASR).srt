00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,250
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,250
University

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:15,269
thank you very much Jeff for that

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,118
generous intro and i hope i can at least

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,939
somewhat appease everyone since they're

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,890
here okay so one of the greatest

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,199
challenges that we have in the 21st

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,439
century as you all know and implants is

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,359
trying to connect genotype to phenotype

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,670
but also i think one other grand

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,450
challenge we have is trying to feed more

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,990
people highly nutritious food and where

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:44,640
my research lies is in crop nutritional

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,960
quality high throughput phenotyping and

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,469
analyzing quantitative complex trade

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,719
variation in crops so the large thrust

17
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,729
of my presentation will focus on this

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,729
these two parts right right here and

19
00:00:54,729 --> 00:01:01,629
there'll be parts of in terms of like GS

20
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:03,549
and G wasps as well so when we think of

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,329
the the world's population now we were

22
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:10,599
at seven billion people but for the ones

23
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:14,649
that are in less developed country we're

24
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,658
at 5.8 billion and when you think about

25
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,149
the people who are not getting enough

26
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,420
calories and in the foods that they're

27
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:26,108
eating or there and they aren't eating

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:30,009
foods it's over 1 billion people but

29
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:32,739
where I draw my passion and where I kind

30
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,899
of drive my research right now and what

31
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:39,068
is you know is the thing that really

32
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:40,960
gets me up out of bed every day early in

33
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:44,710
the morning is trying to work on this

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,318
question of two billion malnourished

35
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:49,839
people in the world and when we think

36
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,740
about this we can think of things that

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,219
are extreme so there are these

38
00:01:53,739 --> 00:02:02,318
populations in the world be it n South

39
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:05,188
America Asia or sub-saharan Africa that

40
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:11,590
are highly deficient in things such as

41
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:13,659
vitamin A iron zinc and iodine and then

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,280
things that are just like chronic but

43
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,329
very much targeted in certain

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,340
subpopulations would be such as vitamin

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,400
E

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,128
and b vitamins so of the traits that i

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,620
focus on in my lab are generally

48
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:34,709
pro-vitamin a iron zinc vitamin e and b

49
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,580
vitamins and so for the past almost

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,680
eight years now my colleagues and my

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,160
group have been trying to figure out

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,950
ways to improve variation for these

53
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,509
traits and in maze but be before we go

54
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:54,869
there I would like for you to think

55
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:58,649
about what could be a possible panacea

56
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,329
for solving this grand challenge that

57
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,239
may have and trying to improve the

58
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,689
world's nutritional value of the food

59
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,590
crops that they eat we can think of

60
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:13,919
giving pre-made vitamins out we can

61
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,689
think of having the food process and

62
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:20,309
we're artificially adding vitamins to

63
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:22,199
the food we can also think of increasing

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,689
the amount of fruits and vegetables that

65
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:29,280
people are eating or perhaps fish and

66
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:31,650
eggs so all of these are part of the

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,579
puzzle and and the one I would like to

68
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,510
focus on now biofortification and that's

69
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:42,599
where we're trying to use variation in

70
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:47,159
plant populations being genes to try to

71
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:50,729
improve the quantity of these different

72
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,219
nutritional compounds so it is certainly

73
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:56,459
possible one could trade take a

74
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:58,500
transgenic approach to this and now you

75
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,909
can think about even in the future after

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,930
we find the causative variants such as a

77
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:09,180
crisper approach could also be used but

78
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,430
in the case of maize which I will now

79
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:16,500
focus on we've been able to use the

80
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,319
populations that already are present say

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,168
in the tropical and temperate parts of

82
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,509
the world and harnessing that variation

83
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,329
in plant breeding populations without

84
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,399
having to take a transgenic approach but

85
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,579
when we think about mais oui we all love

86
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,829
maze it drives our econ

87
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:38,938
here in the US but there are some

88
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:42,418
countries such as Zambia here in in

89
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:46,650
orange where over fifty percent of their

90
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:50,038
calories are coming from maize and why

91
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:51,750
this is a possible issue is we think

92
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,168
about maze it's a great source of

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,439
carbohydrates those calories that i was

94
00:04:55,168 --> 00:05:01,529
talking up earlier but what it lacks is

95
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:04,439
a lot of the nutritional components that

96
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:08,788
these at-risk populations very much

97
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:12,930
needs such as vitamin a vitamin e b

98
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:16,728
vitamins iron and zinc the great thing

99
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:20,759
about maize it has tremendous natural

100
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:24,508
variation for these important phenotypes

101
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:28,278
for this world's population so we can

102
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:31,050
think about harnessing it in a

103
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:33,120
biofortification approach so what that

104
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,629
first requires is trying to find the

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,908
genes and in a sense at the end because

106
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,830
of the variants that are controlling

107
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:44,550
that this variation in these plant

108
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:47,218
populations so one of the traits that

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,550
we've heavily focused on in my group is

110
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:53,430
pro vitamin a and after it's consumed

111
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,060
say by humans it is then converted into

112
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:01,918
what we now know is vitamin A but let's

113
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,949
at first look at the impact of vitamin A

114
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,740
in the world when you think of these

115
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,449
at-risk populations that are not getting

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,300
enough vitamin A into foods that they

117
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,139
eat there are seven million pregnant

118
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,079
women 127 million priests preschool age

119
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,829
children are vitamin A deficient and if

120
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:26,399
you look at this green area right here

121
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:28,139
and such as like Zambia where as I was

122
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,519
saying earlier half of their calories

123
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,139
are coming from maize and they're at

124
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,430
least like twenty percent of the

125
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:44,088
population is severe for being deficient

126
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,740
in vitamin A vitamin A deficiency causes

127
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:48,620
600,000 I

128
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,060
a childhood 2 f's each year and

129
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:56,990
blindness and 500,000 children each year

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,030
so the thing that drives us when you are

131
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,569
a plant breeder you have the opportunity

132
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:07,250
to create something that can be of value

133
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:09,889
to humanity and this is in a sense where

134
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,220
my passion lies because all of this is

135
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:17,990
preventable and this is something we can

136
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,330
tackle as plant breeders but with trying

137
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,560
to ask any question when it comes to to

138
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,639
plant breeding you have to ask a

139
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,970
question what is the composition for a

140
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:34,788
particular compound in the grain in this

141
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:38,270
case we're looking at carotenoids and if

142
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:41,509
you look here the highest proportion are

143
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:42,948
zeaxanthin and lutein those are

144
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,620
obviously very important for the health

145
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:49,788
of the eye but they have no pro vitamin

146
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,709
A activity at all so of the compounds

147
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:54,079
here there are basically three which

148
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,000
have Pro vitamin A activity but my

149
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,089
favorite and the one that has highest

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,009
pro vitamin A activity our friend beta

151
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,978
carotene right here but as you see here

152
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:07,129
is only six percent of the total of the

153
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:09,620
carotenoids found in grain of maize now

154
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,860
let's think about it in terms of the

155
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:16,788
continuous variation in a population for

156
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,240
this compound so on average in a

157
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:22,818
population of temperate and tropical

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,918
lines that is capturing a lot of the

159
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:31,819
variation in the public breeding pool on

160
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:34,338
average 1.7 so to put that into context

161
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:39,430
harvest plus has a target of tenfold

162
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:43,550
that so on average we need to increase

163
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:48,949
beta-carotene by tenfold as you see here

164
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:50,539
though at the tail it's only 7.5 okay so

165
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,740
what you should then be asking yourself

166
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:58,049
as plant breeders is is their superior

167
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:01,289
alleles that we can recompile

168
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:04,069
in these likes a tropical maze during

169
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:08,549
plasm populations that we can increase

170
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:10,379
pro-vitamin a two or even greater than

171
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,990
this this target that's been set by

172
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,899
harvest plus so that's that's a

173
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,299
challenge that we have here now the

174
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,350
other tray we've been working on in my

175
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,969
lab is vitamin E so there's something

176
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,970
that needs to be clearly defined here

177
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,879
there aren't really extreme deficient

178
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:35,700
populations in the world for a vitamin e

179
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:37,679
there are populations in various

180
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,290
countries that are not getting enough

181
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,319
vitamin e in the foods that they eat so

182
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:48,078
even in the u.s. here there are 26 or

183
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:52,200
forty percent of people that had plasma

184
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:55,069
to tocopheryl at a concentration that

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:00,028
was actually lead to an increase of

186
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:03,990
cardiovascular disease that's 26 to

187
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:07,679
forty-one percent in the US and when we

188
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,860
think about it now in terms across the

189
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,679
world there hasn't been a lot of work on

190
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,649
vitamin E as there has been on vitamin A

191
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,849
so we don't really have a good handle on

192
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:23,490
what are the at-risk populations across

193
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,430
the world but for what has been re

194
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:30,720
reported we see that there are some

195
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:34,649
countries such as Brazil and who knows

196
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,089
what this country is Tunisia very good

197
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,089
melody very very good

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,690
obviously the French are very well

199
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:49,040
trained on your geography so here we can

200
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:51,980
ask the same question and in this case

201
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,939
alpha tocopherol has divided the highest

202
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,970
vitae media activity in grain of maize

203
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:02,960
but as we see here only eleven percent

204
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:06,710
of all of the cocoa criminals ie vitamin

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,660
E compounds are come come comprising

206
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,050
what you would actually find in grayned

207
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:13,399
of maize but then when we look at the

208
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:15,979
continuous variation as we did with the

209
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,519
pro vitamin a here we have an average of

210
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,889
eight point one nine so if if we can do

211
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,069
some calculations based on eating 400

212
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,919
grams per day on what someone would

213
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,640
require on average you're talking about

214
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:34,669
breeding like 42 maybe fly fold higher

215
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,409
on on average in a population so this is

216
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:39,829
something that it actually seems to be

217
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:43,549
more tractable right but there's a catch

218
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:48,530
that I will show in in a few of upcoming

219
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:50,990
slides so so now we have the challenge

220
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,539
here we want to find what these

221
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,529
causative genes are and we also want to

222
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:58,789
find whether the superior alleles

223
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,759
patrolling this variation in these

224
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:05,449
populations and everyone's favorite

225
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,789
hammer the maze damn population here it

226
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:12,310
has been genotype with hapmap version 1

227
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:15,980
and version 2 and we've had two

228
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:18,289
outgrowth of this population and if we

229
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,700
can include all the checks and controls

230
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:26,269
we are pushing close to 20,000 hplc runs

231
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,020
on on this seed which as you would

232
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:33,110
imagine required chaining for postdocs

233
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,669
to for hplc s for two years of course

234
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:39,019
they weren't chained but that's just

235
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:43,048
kind of give you an idea here but the

236
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:46,318
so the the positive here if there is one

237
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:48,688
we can actually phenotype carotenoids

238
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:54,298
and took a criminal's at the same time

239
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:56,248
from the same grain sample and one other

240
00:12:54,298 --> 00:13:00,088
thing of value is here so we have the

241
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:04,548
hapmap version 1 and 2 the hplc data and

242
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:07,799
we've done RNA seek on 6 time points on

243
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:13,289
grain after it has been pollinated so

244
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:19,220
you can think about over these six time

245
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:22,078
points of the 25 founder lines of the

246
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,350
population here and so what that then

247
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:28,409
gives us the chance to really do here is

248
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,558
ask the question what in a sense what

249
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:35,730
genes are turned on and off over the

250
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:37,678
phase of kernels but also it allows us

251
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,199
to ask the question for the cutie LS

252
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:43,860
that we find which ones are actually II

253
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:49,678
QTL and when these eqtl are actually

254
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:52,619
turned on and so obviously i can show

255
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:56,338
hundreds of these plots but i will just

256
00:13:52,619 --> 00:14:00,028
be showing two so here what we innocents

257
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:03,839
are finding is for our favorite pro

258
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:05,999
vitamin a and compound beta-carotene for

259
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,449
you know this one has the highest for

260
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:11,959
vitamin A activity there are only seven

261
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,698
QTL that are controlling that phenotype

262
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,528
so as as you should be thinking as

263
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:18,178
breeders this is something then that is

264
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:21,119
very tractable because when you think

265
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:23,519
something as complex and yield there

266
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:28,168
could be hundreds to perhaps thousands

267
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,759
of genes controlling that variation but

268
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:33,389
for this in terms of like the

269
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,989
composition trait in the grain itself we

270
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:39,629
are only finding 7q tl's in this

271
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:43,679
population but I would also like to

272
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:46,350
offer that there are most likely rare

273
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:48,958
variants out there that haven't been

274
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,830
captured in this population that could

275
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,299
become

276
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,150
contributing to variation as as well

277
00:14:53,299 --> 00:15:03,419
when you think about it as as a crop so

278
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:06,629
of these QTL we found five hits that are

279
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:11,360
in very well defined candidate genes

280
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:14,789
from the carotenoid pathway so that

281
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,460
gives us a pretty good feeling and in

282
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:20,669
these five QT l's which had what we will

283
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:24,180
refer to as a priority ins had very

284
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:28,500
large effects as well whereas these two

285
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:30,599
that are unresolved had effect sizes in

286
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,179
terms of across the population that were

287
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:38,430
actually very small so in a sense we're

288
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:41,219
able to define and determine what these

289
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:45,059
causative genes actually are for the key

290
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:50,129
QTL controlling this this trait in this

291
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:52,019
population and this is where the RNA

292
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,960
seek data can become very valuable

293
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,919
because then we can begin putting all

294
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,310
the QT ELLs on a time access and so what

295
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,309
we are seeing here these are the effect

296
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:08,219
estimates for the QTL themselves and

297
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:12,209
this is the log-transformed FP km value

298
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,509
for for the gene okay so you can kind of

299
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,540
just kind of view it like copies poor

300
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:21,059
for the gene and each of these founder

301
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:25,439
lines here but what we're seeing here

302
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:27,000
for this one gene does crit RB 1 which

303
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,180
is as I see here is converting

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,320
beta-carotene to beta crypto xanthine

305
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:37,439
which has only half of the pro vitamin A

306
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:41,629
activity as this compound here and this

307
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,390
is very much an eqtl and it's constant

308
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:48,929
over the whole if if you will phase of

309
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:52,500
the colonel ok so in here it's turned on

310
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:55,079
at 12 days after pollination here 20

311
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,259
days after pollination so sort of thing

312
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,950
here that's very valuable is so we're

313
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,360
testing the effect sizes or the effects

314
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:09,568
themselves of the queue

315
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,459
GL with the gene activity ok so in a

316
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:19,409
sense we're able to then say that this

317
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:22,500
is in fact in eqtl and since five of the

318
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,470
seven QTL work on controlling variation

319
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,380
and from a pathway we now have the

320
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,420
opportunity to really design a pathway

321
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,010
breeding approach to improving pro

322
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:38,730
vitamin A in maize and here in this case

323
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:40,950
we have these two genes right here which

324
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,349
you can kind of view them as you want

325
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,289
them turned on very highly because they

326
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:50,039
are generating the precursors ok and

327
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:54,740
this is a psy one gene right here this

328
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:58,289
is the first enzyme going into the

329
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,569
retinoid pathway and you want this gene

330
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,009
to be turned on very high as well

331
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:05,039
because you want to take all the flux

332
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:09,119
from here and have it going down into

333
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:13,109
the carotenoid pathway and then if we

334
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:15,719
have in allele of this epsilon gene

335
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:17,969
right here that is weak then the

336
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,940
activity of this gene will be low and

337
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,339
then the flux will then shift over to

338
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,308
this branch point over here and why that

339
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:28,289
is important because this is a side with

340
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:31,859
beta-carotene which has a pro highest

341
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:35,428
pro vitamin A activity right and so we

342
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:38,189
have to have a break in our pathway to

343
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:41,700
so this is where the crit rb1 comes into

344
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:46,320
play if we have a weak allele of this

345
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:49,259
gene here that means less beta-carotene

346
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,879
will be converted to this compound which

347
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,460
has only half of the pro vitamin A

348
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,890
activity so now when we think about

349
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,819
breeding for provide high pro vitamin A

350
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,830
content becomes very much a

351
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:04,529
combinatorial breeding approach when

352
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:07,740
you're just trying to recombine the most

353
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:12,029
optimal variation at each of the genes

354
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:16,589
to get the highest quantity of pro

355
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:20,308
vitamin A in maize grain and in

356
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:24,959
i would say in the past five to six

357
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:31,470
years these two genes here have been

358
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:35,778
used to release hi pro-vitamin a hybrids

359
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,220
to the country of Zambia and and and now

360
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:41,490
having worked with very much closely

361
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,429
with harvest plus with my colleagues now

362
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,579
there are over 10,000 farmers in Zambia

363
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:50,700
that are growing this orange hi pro

364
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,678
vitamin maze so I think one thing that's

365
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
you know obviously very valuable when

366
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,298
you're being in a plant breeding

367
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,090
Department is is obviously you want to

368
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:04,259
do cutting-edge science but we have to

369
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:06,990
reduce what we are doing to practice to

370
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,179
have an impact on the people that we are

371
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,259
trying to help and I think one of the

372
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:16,590
key points here is that if we just

373
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:19,019
created something something that's kind

374
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:21,569
of like a foreign concept of high pro

375
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:24,210
vitamin A orange maize and brought it to

376
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,950
a country like Zambia they probably

377
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,028
wouldn't eat it because say it for the

378
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:32,700
past hundred years they have been eating

379
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:36,798
grain that is white from maize and as

380
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:40,230
innocence has no Pro vitamin A at all

381
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,778
okay so there's like a strong cultural

382
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,490
preference to eat the grain that is

383
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:50,009
white but because of outreach and

384
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,849
education from groups like harvest plus

385
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:56,908
they actually go into the towns and they

386
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:59,788
educate the end user that eating this

387
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:03,230
maze will save the eyesight of your

388
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:06,690
children and perhaps also their lives

389
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:10,950
because if you don't bring the public in

390
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,110
from the very beginning we cannot expect

391
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,169
that they will use something that we

392
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:21,990
have created over the past 10 years so

393
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,210
now Christine in my lab has been

394
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,950
carrying out some some work where we

395
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,889
have been trying to ask a question okay

396
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:33,740
we've been breathing for high vitamin A

397
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:36,288
what happens when these this pathway

398
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,870
which we have now characterized very

399
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:41,119
well is being perturbed by heat and

400
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:43,398
drought and that's some of the things

401
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,129
that she's been carrying out now and as

402
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:48,589
as I'm pretty sure the seeds have been

403
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,570
planted the plants are germinating and

404
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:53,178
and there they are growing and we have

405
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:56,538
everything in place that we will be

406
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:59,269
receiving ship grain coming in this

407
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:03,048
coming year and then we will run hplc on

408
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:04,730
it but that you know the thing we have

409
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:06,740
to ask ourselves with like climate

410
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,440
change as well we where we've been

411
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,130
testing all these high pro vitamin A

412
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,460
lines under well irrigated happy places

413
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:19,940
right now let's put him out in places

414
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,950
where they have to go under go heat and

415
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,340
drought which is very much going to be a

416
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:29,590
reality that that the plants and then

417
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:34,730
the people will face going forward so

418
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:37,339
now to vitamin E and what I showed

419
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,839
earlier was a very tractable trait in

420
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:44,980
the sense we were able to find what the

421
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:49,369
causative gene was for those five QTL

422
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,038
now for alpha tocopherol which has the

423
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:57,229
highest vitamin E activity this is a

424
00:22:52,038 --> 00:23:01,190
case where 13 QTL are controlled this

425
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:04,099
phenotype and when we look to see what

426
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,220
the candidate genes are we only can

427
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:10,428
figure out two of them one thing I would

428
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:15,620
also like to point out is this BTE for

429
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:18,500
gene it's able to capture half of the

430
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:22,879
phenotypic variation that we see in this

431
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,798
population whereas these this one

432
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,980
candidate gene here and all the ones

433
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:31,129
that we can't characterize their percent

434
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:35,750
variation accounting for the phenotype

435
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:41,179
it's actually two person or less so we

436
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:43,009
have now really tried hardly to to like

437
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,269
tease apart these QTL

438
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,769
thing about plants they like to keep

439
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:52,970
things like this very tightly to the

440
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:55,210
best ok so these these are the things

441
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:59,900
that are very challenging to tease apart

442
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:02,180
so of these we we have I would say five

443
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,870
very good candidates that we have been

444
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:09,230
able to tease apart and it seems like

445
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:14,449
transport is actually fairly key in in

446
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:18,220
to sell and for this pathway so this is

447
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:22,279
in contrast to the crib rb1 approach

448
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,430
whereas here 12 days after pollination

449
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:30,019
we don't really see any trend at all in

450
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:32,600
a sense the activity that in the gene

451
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:37,490
being turned on isn't a tracking with

452
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:40,730
the effects of the QTL at all only 20

453
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:43,970
days after pollination do you really see

454
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:46,640
that enzyme begin to convert gamma

455
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,730
tocopheryl to the compound that has the

456
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,520
highest vitamin e activity so this has

457
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,970
obviously earlier we can then begin to

458
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:59,980
have an idea of when these QTL are

459
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,079
turned on so then we can then have high

460
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,809
hypothesis that can be tested where then

461
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,529
perhaps we can find a cutie l that is

462
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:11,450
turned on 12 days after pollination and

463
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:14,000
then we can ask the question is that

464
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,610
going to lead to higher content in the

465
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,670
grain itself so those are things that we

466
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:26,449
are asking now and after now carrying

467
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:29,060
this board our our grant was just funded

468
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,539
so here we've been previously working on

469
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:35,389
pro vitamin A vitamin E now we're

470
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:38,629
beginning you tackle B vitamins and zinc

471
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:41,150
and iron and this is by d woo in our lab

472
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:45,260
as you see here where the beginning to

473
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:48,830
analyze b1 b2 b3 and b6 and in the grain

474
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:51,440
of maize and in the 281 panel we're

475
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:54,879
finding quite a bit of variation so we

476
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,250
think when they go to a panel say over

477
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,480
two thousand lines will you be able to

478
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,539
find greater variation and these blue

479
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,470
ones right here these are the the lines

480
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:10,450
that we are employing and crosses now

481
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,029
because we're trying to ask the question

482
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:17,400
why is this an it's like an extreme

483
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:21,369
phenotypic outlier is it a QTL that's

484
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,480
you know how does it actually work so

485
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:25,929
that's that's what we're trying to

486
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:31,360
figure out now and this is AG wasthat

487
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:34,480
was run just this past a few weeks in in

488
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,519
the maze aims panel and d woo i'm happy

489
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,470
to say you have some hits here that that

490
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,950
look very very promising that will be

491
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:44,860
able to follow up for for up the trade

492
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:48,220
of iron and why this trade is very

493
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:52,990
important iron deficiency impacts over

494
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,420
two billion people worldwide so this is

495
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,490
like one of the most important traits

496
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:04,930
that we could be breeding for in maize

497
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:06,970
and all of this information now that we

498
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:11,710
are generating in pro vitamin A

499
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:14,230
carotenoids vitamin E took a criminal's

500
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:18,190
B vitamins zinc and iron are actually

501
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:21,849
now being able to feed into my own

502
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:25,660
breeding program because the third most

503
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:30,000
important vegetable in the u.s. is in

504
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:34,840
tomato is in potato it's sweet corn I

505
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,990
know I was surprised as well and would

506
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:41,949
you believe people eat over 20 pounds of

507
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:44,049
it per year I don't consider myself one

508
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,880
of those people but hey there's some

509
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,629
people that could be eating quite a bit

510
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,460
of corn ok so so the thing that we have

511
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,070
been doing for the past two years is

512
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:58,600
growing a very large panel out in the

513
00:27:54,069 --> 00:28:02,829
field and since these traits we have to

514
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,329
phenotype on fresh kernels right ah so

515
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:05,039
this is a little more challenging or

516
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:07,710
what we have been

517
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,930
in a sense in like fuel corn maze we

518
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,059
have to harvest a fresh and then the

519
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,299
ears themselves are in a sense kind of

520
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:18,210
frozen out in in the field and then

521
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:21,960
their ground up frozen and then we run

522
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:25,279
hplc on it thank you Matt for doing all

523
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,860
this hard work and all of this is

524
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:33,269
actually beginning to turn into some

525
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:36,000
some real jiwa hits so our friend right

526
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:38,730
here on chromosome 5 which is that key

527
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,109
enzyme the converts gamma tocopherol to

528
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,920
the compound that has the highest

529
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:47,279
vitamin E activity we hit that same key

530
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,630
gene in this panel but the question we

531
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,509
have now though is the most favorable

532
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,490
variance already in this panel or do we

533
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:59,190
have to begin crossing between germ

534
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,740
plasm pools and that's the real

535
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:07,019
challenge and we hope not but if we have

536
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:10,620
to then we have to and we are also doing

537
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:13,889
gs4 for this breeding program and there

538
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:17,729
were 100 crosses this this past year

539
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:21,600
thank you again Matt so here here we are

540
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:24,870
now doing GS and this if you will this

541
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,299
is like pro vitamin a and this is the

542
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:29,189
combo of these three compounds that have

543
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,379
the highest provide a minute activity

544
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,240
and these two compounds here if you

545
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:38,190
recall are the ones that very critical

546
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:42,120
for eye health so this is just for one

547
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:45,509
hplc run and and so we we think this

548
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:48,599
will improve over time so here for for

549
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:50,759
this tray with its at point six and here

550
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,819
for these these two traits which have

551
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,309
high pro by many activity we're close to

552
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:59,609
point to but part of the challenge with

553
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:03,240
this is is this panel has been genotyped

554
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:07,529
with TBS and as we've seen in our prior

555
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:11,819
work we need to closely tag the

556
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:14,549
causative jeans if you will in the panel

557
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,769
and there there are some genes we are

558
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,259
not tagging very well

559
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:21,480
and so sorry Matt we're going to have to

560
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:23,220
do some targeted pcr to actually pull

561
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,349
those out possibly or we can just do

562
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:31,220
whole genomes and call it a day I'll

563
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:37,500
have you choose which one you want to do

564
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:40,319
so so the one critical question that I

565
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,140
had back in two thousand nine after we

566
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:47,099
were generating all these hat maps were

567
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,350
what about the phenotype and and that's

568
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,659
when I began working on the field based

569
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:54,359
hi to put phenotyping and in my prior

570
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,820
job on cotton because even though we

571
00:30:54,359 --> 00:31:00,750
think with GS we're going to have to do

572
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:03,329
a lot less field phenotyping we have to

573
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,240
do it for the training set and we have

574
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:12,299
to do it repeatedly over time to update

575
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:15,450
the training models as well okay so in

576
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,099
in my prior work we created this high

577
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,620
clearance high-throughput phenotyping

578
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:22,409
tractor here and everything is run on

579
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:25,769
GPS so we can figure out where the

580
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:30,240
actual train is is coming from in a plot

581
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:32,849
and our field map is on a GPS

582
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,680
coordinates as as well and we're able to

583
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:40,669
look at vegetation variation from canopy

584
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,700
reflectance canopy temperature and

585
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:46,710
canopy height and in a great thing with

586
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,410
this tractor was we were able to do it

587
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,420
over the whole growing season and I

588
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,460
didn't have to be out there like 2 p.m.

589
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,070
in the afternoon when it was 120 degrees

590
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:01,350
Fahrenheit we just had someone driving a

591
00:31:56,069 --> 00:32:03,779
tractor 30 just so you know our riri

592
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:07,799
vamped tractor all this call it now has

593
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:10,079
a cab with AC on it so all this this

594
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,909
looks very draconian if you will

595
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,289
someone's having to drive distracted

596
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,930
through the field things have been

597
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:19,019
realized and their improved now so

598
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:21,180
actually it's all on GPS and everything

599
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:24,059
so the person in the tractor cab doesn't

600
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,009
even have to touch the wheel he or she

601
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,179
just sits in there and it just drives by

602
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:30,359
itself and they're in a

603
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,460
CN for all I know they could be having

604
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:34,049
some like film fest in there or

605
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,340
something you know because you don't

606
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:41,609
have to see where you're driving at that

607
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:44,459
point and and so this is where you have

608
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:47,459
a question that you're asking and the

609
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,710
tool isn't created so I had the question

610
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,220
in in terms of like how much variation

611
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:56,490
is therefore say can it be temperature

612
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:59,370
and kind of quantify that over time over

613
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,980
their whole growing season and can i

614
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:04,439
find QTL that is actually controlling

615
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,569
that variation at each of the key time

616
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,910
points over the growth phase of cotton

617
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:11,639
and here we had every common in inbred

618
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:15,029
lion population so this was very

619
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,930
humbling when I went into cotton there

620
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:22,079
were no very large population so I had

621
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,970
to use what was basically created for me

622
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,769
at first and then we here we had the

623
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,200
high-throughput phenotyping tractor and

624
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,389
then we had a cotton picker driving

625
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,500
through to do traits which was like

626
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:36,390
yield fiber quality traits and some

627
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,210
plant food straights is Tim setter here

628
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,910
I was going to give a shout out to him

629
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,970
for thank you for doing this plant a say

630
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,640
here but I'll highlight that reading

631
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,279
results soon so here we we have our

632
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,120
actual test year so here we had dry rep

633
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:56,700
one which is basically our drought this

634
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:00,059
one here is our couldn't control treated

635
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,670
as wet then dry rep to and wet rep to

636
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:06,389
right here and and the great thing is

637
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:10,349
all growing on on drip and it hardly

638
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:13,400
ever rains in Arizona although I will

639
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:15,929
say if you do plan a drought test it

640
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:20,070
increases the probability of rain I have

641
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:23,239
seen even in a place like Arizona and I

642
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:26,010
think one other key point is we had to

643
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,259
characterize the variation for the soil

644
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,360
as well such as like clay and sand

645
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,430
content because whenever you're doing

646
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,110
any drought testing the soil will have

647
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,969
more variation than your actual plant

648
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,120
population for the phenotype that you

649
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:41,029
are testing so just to kind of give you

650
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,609
an idea of where we are here so you

651
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:49,640
here we were at planting right here and

652
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:52,460
up until first flower everything was

653
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,629
treated the same and in terms of the

654
00:34:52,460 --> 00:35:01,159
drip and at flowering is where we began

655
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:02,900
imposing the droughts treatment and and

656
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,929
in traits that we were also doing where

657
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,570
canopy temperature this is a vegetation

658
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:13,489
II and to see here and canopy height and

659
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:17,090
this is early in the morning 10 am-1

660
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:19,059
p.m. and it's in in the afternoon so in

661
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:22,610
a sense you're trying to capture the the

662
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:26,480
variation over the whole growing season

663
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:28,670
here as we're doing is this eat every

664
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,570
week but also capturing the variation at

665
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:36,200
each time point within each of those

666
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:39,050
weeks and so the the three growth phases

667
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:44,119
that we were targeting were at flowering

668
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:47,150
and as post flower and as we have the

669
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,579
growing fiber as well and then of course

670
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:53,660
yield and the fiber quality traits that

671
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:55,429
were collected as well and so this was

672
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,619
just published this this year and one of

673
00:35:55,429 --> 00:36:00,319
the fascinating things with this work is

674
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:02,690
prior to this there really wasn't a way

675
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,160
to quantify it for a like hannah p

676
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,280
temperature in the field it had to be

677
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:10,329
all by hand but traits like this can

678
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,880
actually change change with with time

679
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:15,739
very rapidly so then you can think you

680
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,860
would and maybe have to have an army of

681
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:21,409
people to do like 400 in some plots just

682
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,630
for a traders canopy temperature but

683
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:26,089
this case the the tractor could

684
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:30,980
phenotype all of the plot in a half an

685
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:35,539
hour and here we have each of the years

686
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,820
so it's 2010 2011 2012 and this is the

687
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:40,190
treatment wet and this would be the dry

688
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,350
drought treatment here and if it's red

689
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,420
then we have a QTL in a sense as

690
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:46,339
increasing the canopy temperature if

691
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,789
it's blue we have a QTL that's

692
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,590
decreasing the canopy temperature then

693
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:55,460
so if Tim was here he would be so

694
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:57,829
excited that s Isaac ass

695
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,590
it actually hit one of our key canopy

696
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:03,739
temperature QTL and this is actually

697
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,870
showing up pretty early on in the growth

698
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:09,019
phase of the plant and its carrying

699
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:11,839
forward towards harvest as as well under

700
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:14,630
the two treatments and why that is

701
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,410
important because this is a plant

702
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,230
hormone that is innocence controlling

703
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:25,099
transpiration rate so since we also have

704
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:28,820
a QTL that is going right here it's a

705
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:30,409
possible candidate gene but as you're

706
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,030
trying to find candidate genes you

707
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,759
should always have the caveat you can

708
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:37,550
always find a candidate gene right but

709
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,790
this one actually you can tie in with

710
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:44,090
the biology very well and the actual

711
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:48,670
compound itself maps to the same place

712
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:51,650
as they can it be temperature qto and

713
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,930
then we also wanted to ask question can

714
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:57,139
we use this to also track with with

715
00:37:53,929 --> 00:38:02,179
yield and what we found out is the

716
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:05,089
plants that take or in a sense take a

717
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:07,759
great risk and I will say this because

718
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:11,420
these are the ones that plan to use a

719
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,910
lot of water and can continue to cool

720
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,639
their canopy here these are the plants

721
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:19,250
that will be trying to conserve the

722
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,980
water and then they won't cool their

723
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:24,889
canopy so for the plants that are grown

724
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:29,809
here if you recall everything is grown

725
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:32,690
under drip in a hot arid world okay now

726
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:35,119
for the one set are going to continue to

727
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,429
trend transpire at a high rate they're

728
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,199
going to continue to fix carbon and if

729
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:42,559
they're going to continue to fix carbon

730
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:45,619
there are going to have higher yield but

731
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,349
if you are perhaps growing in a dry land

732
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,900
part of the world you would perhaps want

733
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:54,349
a genotype that will conserve water

734
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,840
early on and then we'll in the sense you

735
00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:00,589
use more towards the end of the growing

736
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:04,890
season such as like rain fill or fill in

737
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:09,180
this case for old fiber

738
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:11,779
so what we also figured out was that

739
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:15,299
canopy temperature at flowering was most

740
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,880
predictive of yield at the end of the

741
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,750
season and and the reason why that was

742
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:24,690
it's it's clear now to us that if

743
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,119
there's high heat what do you think is

744
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,840
going to happen to that pollen apollomon

745
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,579
isn't going to be very valuable right so

746
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,150
that is kind of like what is happening

747
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,719
here so if you have a high heat event at

748
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:43,110
flowering it'll have a great impact on

749
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:46,829
the pollen the pollen will be in a

750
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:52,680
viable and then you won't have any seed

751
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:55,110
ie cotton fiber okay so we know wanted

752
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,329
to ask the question after Cotton's bendy

753
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:00,660
foliated in a sense you add a chemical

754
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:03,449
that drops all of the beautiful green

755
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,329
leaves you can then drive a combine

756
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:11,339
through it here right so this is in a

757
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:14,489
sense creating a cloud point map of all

758
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:18,059
of the cotton plants in our field and in

759
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:20,579
a sense what this is is you take

760
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,940
something that's like bright laser you

761
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:27,630
shine it at a plant it comes back time

762
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,240
of flight and then as its returning you

763
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,670
calculate the time and then you can

764
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,579
recreate like a 3d map of the actual

765
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:38,369
plant itself so since this is the

766
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:40,519
defoliant cotton what I really wanted to

767
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,619
do with this was actually try to count

768
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:46,320
yield and how do you do that count the

769
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,440
cotton bolls so here's a case where we

770
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,180
have one plot now and so since this con

771
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,610
has been defoliant you can see this

772
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:56,399
right here these are the cotton bolls

773
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,500
right here so this piece of e equipment

774
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,420
was kind of put on the tractor and here

775
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,449
the tractor is driving through the field

776
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,880
and we're recreating the geometry of the

777
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:08,609
plants them themselves and then you can

778
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,000
pull out one plant and then use a

779
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,980
Euclidean clustering approach and then

780
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,440
you're using that to count the cotton

781
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,449
poles on the plant which is in a sense

782
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,150
yield because there are actually

783
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:22,828
you know cotton breeders I grow out

784
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,079
hundreds of thousands of plots and they

785
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:27,269
don't want to combine all of those all

786
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,410
at once right they just want to target

787
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:34,289
just those like f2s or F for plants out

788
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:40,980
in the field so this could be valuable

789
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:44,940
for that so now that was was cotton and

790
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:48,449
now with this myth maze so we kind of

791
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:51,630
had the question how do we do plant

792
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:54,838
pathology in a cornfield it's all by I

793
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:57,570
it's all with human beings if I'm out in

794
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:01,440
the field I guarantee you I probably

795
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:04,250
won't be accurate like tier if he's out

796
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,220
in the field so how do we move that

797
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:11,789
subjectivity from plant phenotyping and

798
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:16,559
if you're wondering this is the one

799
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:19,009
that's the corn light okay so can we

800
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,529
find the actual blight out in the field

801
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:25,770
so this is where artificial intelligence

802
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:28,200
actually comes into play and then tying

803
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:31,369
it with drones because we should now

804
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:35,460
kind of view drones as almost our

805
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:37,829
colleagues and our co-workers and so

806
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,199
when I yes it sounds a little

807
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:43,980
frightening so when when you have this

808
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,409
drone flying through a a cornfield can

809
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:49,170
you have it so that it's taking a photo

810
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:51,598
and then it's analyzing that photo

811
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:54,389
telling you if a certain pathogen is on

812
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,050
that corn leaf and then tell the actual

813
00:42:54,389 --> 00:43:02,460
grower where he or she should go to the

814
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:04,380
field to either of apply a chemical

815
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,199
we're actually you know chopped a plant

816
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,250
down or something like that so what we

817
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:15,318
have here is an actual drone photo of

818
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:20,010
corn field and this would be a beautiful

819
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:22,050
corn vision right there right though the

820
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,900
challenge is I can easily find this one

821
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,940
can we train to AI to go through

822
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,740
thousands and thousands of photos that

823
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,220
have been taking over the course of the

824
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:34,429
year to then find it

825
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:36,489
and I think one of the most you know

826
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:39,589
painful things is training this AI

827
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:42,489
because you have to have actual a true

828
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:48,108
in effect plant pathologist that's

829
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:51,229
telling yes no yes no yes no so training

830
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:53,809
it I think is I think almost like the

831
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:57,289
hardest part and you may have to train

832
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:59,659
on thousands of actual photos and and to

833
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:02,210
kind of get an idea of how this works

834
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:04,839
from the easiest way I can tell you is

835
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:15,260
it's in a sense converting pixels into

836
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:18,410
words okay yes vs no and so after the AI

837
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:22,460
has been been trained we can then take a

838
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:26,239
photo from the field that thanks to tier

839
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:29,420
that that he took and then we can apply

840
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:33,348
the AI to that plant and in this case if

841
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:36,108
it's black that means probability of

842
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:39,200
zero if it's very bright white

843
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:42,019
probability of one so in this case it's

844
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,199
finding all of them on the leaves right

845
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:48,530
here and then it's finding even some

846
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:50,358
right here on that leaf so probably one

847
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,810
of the real challenges is trained this

848
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:57,699
AI is when you're out in the field you

849
00:44:53,809 --> 00:45:00,920
also have a lot of soil and other plant

850
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:04,939
parts and fragments if you will covering

851
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,070
the ground and also weeds okay and then

852
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,039
we can also ask a question in the case

853
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:14,390
where we don't see any do you find any

854
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:17,349
and in this case no so how well our are

855
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:22,608
we doing I think we're doing pretty well

856
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:25,500
but we can always be a lot better but I

857
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:30,869
I'm kind of happy with that but

858
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:34,679
sorry so now let's talk about robots the

859
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:37,469
20th century was all about chemicals the

860
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:40,829
21st is all going to be about robotics

861
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:41,879
and I think when we think about plant

862
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:43,610
breeding what we should be thinking

863
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,470
about and this is my colleague Josh

864
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:48,750
where you can then be creating these

865
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:51,989
autonomous field robots that can do

866
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:55,050
phenotyping that are going through to

867
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:57,769
via fields doing such traces like canopy

868
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:01,380
temperature can it be reflectance and

869
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:06,090
canopy geometry and what that can begin

870
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:08,730
I'll actually really ask the question is

871
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:11,519
what cutie elzar turned on over the

872
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:14,750
entire growing season and then when you

873
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,190
think about calculating biomass yield if

874
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:19,099
the robot is driving through the field

875
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:22,769
every day you can then think about

876
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,839
biomass yield every single day over the

877
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:27,659
whole growing season and then you can

878
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:31,190
perhaps begin to really think apart you

879
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:33,509
know like tease apart gie questions and

880
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,869
where I think this field is actually

881
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:39,110
heading is so we have the AI and we have

882
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:42,929
that thing that we call the Breeders I

883
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:46,740
let's use it to chain to train low-cost

884
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:51,000
field robots to actually begin to help

885
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:56,279
select plants from the field so in in

886
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,829
this concept here we have this very

887
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,730
low-cost robot with these thin carbon

888
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:05,730
fiber legs it can walk through the plots

889
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:08,639
right so say we had a breeder that may

890
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:11,670
walk through like 4000 plots and that

891
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:15,000
breeder is in a sense choosing plants

892
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:18,690
based on their height and plant

893
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,110
pathology if that breeder can then train

894
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,079
the AI you can then turned out these

895
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:27,809
low-cost robots just to kind of like

896
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,630
walk through the field and then they can

897
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,549
choose the plants for the breeder and if

898
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:35,780
the breeder isn't happy with the plants

899
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:37,318
that were chosen they can retrain the AI

900
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,640
each each

901
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:44,308
so this is a concept now but this is

902
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,318
where I see the field in the future and

903
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,539
that's where I'm kind of trying to like

904
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:52,318
drag the field of a plant breeding on

905
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:55,229
this side aspect of it now with that

906
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,420
there are a lot of colleagues to thank

907
00:47:55,228 --> 00:47:59,308
for this work I won't be able to thank

908
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,989
them all because i'm at a time because

909
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:03,359
we have the computer problems that first

910
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:05,869
but with that i'll thank you for your

911
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:05,869
for your time

912
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:24,230
yes we yep

913
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:40,559
yeah so the question that Lee asked did

914
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:44,579
we find the most superior psy one gene

915
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,670
in a sense i would say at this point in

916
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:50,880
time no but there are at least two or

917
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,710
three that we have seen but we I don't

918
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,340
know if we found the one that is like

919
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,690
the the the key one and that's that's

920
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,300
where as we're hoping with like the Ames

921
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,550
panel that we may actually find that and

922
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,200
if we weren't happy with it then we'll

923
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:09,530
just create our own in a future so yeah

924
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:09,529
yes dear

925
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,699
yes

926
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,289
now it actually has them because like

927
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,960
the part of the seed where those genes

928
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:34,639
are turned on it hasn't had an impact on

929
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,639
it at all yeah yes

930
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,880
or maybe or overlap

931
00:49:52,068 --> 00:50:00,588
yeah we I I kind of have seen some some

932
00:49:56,909 --> 00:50:03,750
things that have been published but I

933
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:05,759
don't think they've you know some of its

934
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,309
then been in like greenhouses and growth

935
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,500
chambers and things like that so I think

936
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:13,829
this has been kind of the P key part

937
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,170
actually taking it out to the to the

938
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:18,089
field and actually testing it but yeah

939
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,780
there there are some things that where

940
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:29,449
we we think that we should see and we'll

941
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:29,450
we'll see if we actually stand yeah yeah

942
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:47,900
yeah that's phase two but yes yeah yeah

943
00:50:52,880 --> 00:51:05,180
oh oh cool oh good good um so the thing

944
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,759
about took a criminal's it can enhance

945
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:09,858
the longevity of some of the compounds

946
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:13,059
in the seed and that's that's what

947
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,058
you're basically saying right

948
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:24,619
mhm

949
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:38,629
I think

950
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:43,029
oh and sorghum yeah okay well good good

951
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,030
okay yeah Susan

952
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,329
the issues one of the many issues the

953
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:53,489
golden rice debate a high beta carotene

954
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:56,130
rights which doesn't make it naturally

955
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:58,108
it's always a transgenic is that they

956
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,559
can get the level but it decreases over

957
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:04,949
time in storage and rice traditionally

958
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:08,000
ride down stored over the course of the

959
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:08,000
season and by the time

960
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:14,550
they had anticipated so if there were we

961
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:16,170
can learn from names at a high level of

962
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:18,300
vitamin foreign Sorbonne that a high

963
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:20,760
level of vitamin D helps to stabilize it

964
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:25,310
that could be very very significant for

965
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,310
the way which

966
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:39,189
calling it was a transformation effort

967
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:42,190
that early on right afterwards yeah oh

968
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:45,730
yeah and you know that we we also see

969
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:48,940
that same problem and in the high you

970
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:51,480
know corn but the thing is is there is

971
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,940
like an E and a G by E and edgy

972
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,010
component to it and and the g component

973
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,110
I think we can kind of get a handle of

974
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:04,200
but then there's like a large key

975
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,200
component that I think is more complex

976
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:27,599
oh okay yeah yeah yeah huh that's an

977
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:27,599
intriguing yeah sure okay

978
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:48,920
any questions from geneva this has been

979
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:52,899
a production of Cornell University on

980
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,900
the web at cornell edu
