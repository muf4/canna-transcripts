1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,759
University okay well I'm excited to tell

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,880
you all a little bit about my research

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
and extension program in tomato and

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,359
eggplant

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
breeding okay um so first to give you

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
just some very high level um goals of

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
our research and extension program first

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,719
and foremost um you know maybe the most

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,879
important goal is to develop and release

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,839
cultivars and germ plasm are adapted to

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,960
the Northeast us with high yield quality

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,160
and resistance to the diseases of

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,600
importance in this region we also do

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,479
more fundamental work um discovering and

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,960
characterizing um traits that are of

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,198
importance whether it's a farmers or

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,198
consumers in in in this area um I'm also

19
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:54,159
really interested in modeling strategies

20
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,320
for implementing new technologies in in

21
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,919
an applied vegetable breeding program

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,159
and specifically what I'm referring to

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,679
are things like genomic selection High

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,039
throughput phenotyping these are things

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,478
that have become almost routine in some

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,159
large scale breeding programs for

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,759
agronomic crops but in Horticultural

28
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,080
species they're much more rarely used

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,640
and you know there's some legitimate

30
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,319
reasons for that and you know I'm

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,759
interested in just testing out ways that

32
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,158
we can do this

33
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,359
practically um lastly I have a 40%

34
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,159
extension appointment and what we try to

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,478
do is to generate and disseminate

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,479
results on variety performance in New

37
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:32,078
York for our

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,719
stakeholders so um you know the first

39
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,438
thing I tried to do after I started in

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,078
my position um about 16 months ago was

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,438
to get an idea of you know who the

42
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:43,039
stakeholders are in New York what does

43
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,239
tomato production look like so I could

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,759
focus our our breeding program and

45
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,000
there's really quite a diversity so

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,359
tomatoes are grown in the open field

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,879
they're grown in high tunnels um we also

48
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,078
have some of the most sophisticated

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,879
Greenhouse uh companies in the world in

50
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:00,599
New York State this is a picture of

51
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,438
green Empire Farm

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:07,679
which is a 32 acre greenhouse outside of

53
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,840
Syracuse tomatoes are sold wholesale at

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
produce auctions and to Brokers and to

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,878
grocery stores they're also sold

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,800
directly to Consumers at roadside stands

57
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,079
and farmers markets and through CSA

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,840
shares one thing that I found that maybe

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,800
is consistent no matter you know where I

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,719
visited is um tomato diseases um but

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
even there you know there's quite a

62
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,919
variation depending on the management

63
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,840
practices and growing system and what

64
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,839
what specific diseases show up

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,400
so here's a look at what um we focus on

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,599
in the breeding program and you can see

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,680
it's a pretty extensive list so you know

68
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,878
I think maybe I have my work cut out for

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,040
me um but to just kind of summarize the

70
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,280
targ the traits that we focus on they're

71
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,479
things like earliness yield a plant

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,919
habit that's amable to staking and easy

73
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,238
Harvest this is the suite of diseases

74
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,439
that are important whether in the open

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,039
field or in protected culture in New

76
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,680
York um fruit quality in terms of

77
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,158
cleanliness of fruit is very important

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,640
so that's resistance to things like

79
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,519
cracking and Blossom Ander I'm also

80
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,559
really interested in unique color and

81
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,519
shape combinations so these are tomato

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
varieties that look like maybe some of

83
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,039
our most favorite heirloom varieties but

84
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,560
have some of the disease resistance and

85
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,798
productivity of modern

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,719
varieties and then quality of all types

87
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,040
is important um you know flavors maybe

88
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,239
one of the most important traits but

89
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,318
also one of the most um difficult to

90
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,840
evaluate

91
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,639
I think I might have skipped over a

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,640
slide here it is so here's just a

93
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,679
snapshot of how we do our breeding um

94
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,598
this is a picture actually of an

95
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,239
eggplant pollination we just did our

96
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,158
first eggplant crosses um this month

97
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,039
actually um Tomatoes were about a year

98
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,399
into um our breeding program and we use

99
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,679
a combination of marker assisted

100
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,239
selection and phenotypic selection so

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
here there's a student in the lab um

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,039
actually selecting the seedlings that

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
have the disease resistance markers that

104
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,000
we tested for and the most important

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,438
thing we do put those seedlings out in

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,639
the field and evaluate them for the

107
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,280
traits that I mentioned so this past

108
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,479
summer was our first field season we had

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,598
about 2,000 early generation plants

110
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,318
these are all genetically distinct and

111
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,679
we spend a lot of time walking through

112
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,958
and looking at these and here's a

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
picture of some of our favorite

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,000
selections from this year and we're

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
excited to see how those look in the

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,160
future so I spent a lot of time talking

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,680
about tomato um what about eggplant um I

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,720
think eggplant is interesting because

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,360
there's a bit of a discrepancy in the

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,000
United States it's ranked 28 in terms of

121
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,919
per capita consumption so we eat a

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,839
little bit less eggplant than we do

123
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,959
radish and a little bit more than we eat

124
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:42,000
kale but worldwide it's um 10th in

125
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,478
production in 2023 so there's um you

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,319
know around the world there's a little

127
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,439
bit more appreciation for eggplant than

128
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,759
there is um by many of us here in the

129
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,759
United States why does this matter to a

130
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,400
breeding program based in the

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,240
Northeast um population growth in the

132
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,319
United States is most likely going to be

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,840
driven by people with recent roots in

134
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,599
other countries um this map is showing

135
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,159
circles that are proportional to the um

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
size of that State's population that was

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
born outside the United States um if you

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,199
look at New York for example today

139
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,399
almost one in every four residents of

140
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,639
New York state was born outside of the

141
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,198
US so I think there's a lot of potential

142
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,800
for New Market opportunities for some of

143
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,160
these you know eggplant types and this

144
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,560
goes for other crops as well um that are

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,560
appreciated by people with with roots um

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
elsewhere

147
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
so one of these eggplant types that you

148
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,879
know I'm I'm really interested and we've

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,439
had a lot of fun looking at so far is is

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,079
um what broadly are referred to as

151
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,600
African eggplant these are two different

152
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,159
species selum aeop pum and selum macro

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,759
carpin um these were domesticated in

154
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,520
Africa are still very important

155
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,800
vegetable crops in subsaharan Africa and

156
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,279
some parts of Brazil Italy and South and

157
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,160
Southeast Asia uh we got a small Grant

158
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,839
from the tour sustainability Foundation

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,439
program to partner with some of our

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,000
colleagues in extension and some Urban

161
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,600
gardeners and Growers across the state

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,800
to do some participatory variety

163
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,120
evaluation we've gotten really good

164
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,160
feedback about what people are looking

165
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
for and we're now starting um crosses

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
and hoping to have a participatory

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
breeding program where people can make

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,839
their own selections evaluate things

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,520
that um have the traits that they're

170
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,000
looking for and still select for

171
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,120
adaptation to this climate in New

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,959
York I want to give a just a quick

173
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,879
snapshot of one of our kind of trait

174
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,239
Discovery projects this is one that

175
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,879
we've been working on for about a year

176
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,639
now this is um a project focused on

177
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,079
Cindi tolerance from a wild tomato

178
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,840
species called cenum cidian sanum cidian

179
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,839
is a wild relative of tomato that um is

180
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,959
endemic to the atakama desert of Chile

181
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,439
that's a region of the planet that gets

182
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,000
you know some parts of it get about half

183
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,918
an inch of rainfall a year they've

184
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,439
discovered populations of this species

185
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,839
growing in what are essentially salt

186
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,240
basins um soils with an electrical

187
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,959
conductivity approaching 100 Des semens

188
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,000
per met which is like 40 times what

189
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,680
domesticated tomato can tolerate um and

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,800
uh we are working with a population of

191
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,598
integation lines developed by a

192
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,280
researcher at UC Davis who spent decades

193
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,199
um you know moving genetic material from

194
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,159
this species into tomato and we're

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,598
really fortunate to be able to um you

196
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,919
know pick up the legacy of that research

197
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,439
and evaluate these lines for um

198
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,399
tolerance to solinity so this is a

199
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:32,160
picture of our setup in the greenhouse

200
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,079
uh um these are fertilizer injectors but

201
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
instead of injecting fertilizer into our

202
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,639
drip irrigation lines they're just

203
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,918
injecting different concentrations of

204
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
salt um in one Greenhouse experiment

205
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,560
over the life cycle of the plants we go

206
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,720
through about a 25 pound bag of salt and

207
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,879
we are just looking for lines that are

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,800
able to tolerate this um more than a

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,759
domesticated control um we're actually

210
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,800
wrapping up the Harvest of our first set

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
of of lines this week so we're excited

212
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,960
to see what we

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,240
find lastly I'll just kind of mention a

214
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,359
little bit about our extension program

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,158
this is a picture of a field day we had

216
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,319
last summer that I'm hoping we can make

217
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,759
an annual Field Day along with some of

218
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
my other colleagues in vegetable

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,400
breeding and pathology here at Cornell

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,038
uh we invited people from uh you know

221
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,439
gardeners Farmers members of seed

222
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,318
companies to look at some of the

223
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,000
commercial variety trials that we did um

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,598
I I just uh released a report describing

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,519
one of our vary trials it's being disin

226
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,799
ated through different CCE newsletters

227
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,000
here it is in in V Edge so if any of you

228
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,559
are interested you can find it there or

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,599
or reach out to me I can share that

230
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,278
information with you so I tried to speak

231
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,360
pretty quickly uh I hope I was within

232
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,919
the time but if any of you have any more

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,039
questions or want to reach out here's my

234
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,799
contact information and I'll thank the

235
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,519
members of my lab and our collaborators

236
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,278
and our sources of

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
funding is the is the solinity tolerance

238
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,039
geared toward Greenhouse tomato

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,200
production ultimately or um there's

240
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,360
there's kind of two things that we're

241
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,278
looking at with the city tolerance um

242
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,278
one is it's a big problem actually not

243
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:11,159
in New York in California and we have

244
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,600
some funding from the California tomato

245
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,480
Growers um but closer to to here in New

246
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,278
York um yeah in in protected culture

247
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,039
Cindi can become an issue um it's it's

248
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,360
been a challenge in in high tunnels um

249
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,319
if you exclude precipitation and apply

250
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,600
fertilizer and irrigation water salts

251
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,879
accumulate in the soil and you know

252
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,759
there's ways to manage that through

253
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,278
farming practices but this is another

254
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,600
angle that we're we're

255
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,039
taking so I have a quick question so

256
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,720
looking into your Crystal B right you

257
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,919
mentioned other crops um that might be

258
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,600
growing import to the state so what

259
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,799
would what be a couple of examples of

260
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,079
those that that's a that's a very good

261
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,679
question um I don't know exactly what

262
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,319
they would be we're I'm actually part of

263
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,958
a group that's putting together a

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,640
proposal uh where this would be a

265
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,838
portion of that we're hoping to do like

266
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,600
a stakeholder needs assessment and have

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,560
people suggest to us what are some these

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,879
crops that you know they are currently

269
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,159
growing or wish to grow but the

270
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,600
varieties might not be you know well

271
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,399
adapted to New York and there's

272
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,240
potential for for breeding there yeah

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,120
and then for future change in you know

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:18,360
climate exactly yeah okay yes okay thank

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
you thanks right thank you all right so

276
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,560
today I want to keep it relatively short

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,399
and sweet but just kind of go over the

278
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,838
main H thrusts of the research program

279
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,839
that I'm establishing here in plant

280
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,640
biology and big focus of this is on

281
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,320
plant evolutionary responses to climate

282
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,078
change

283
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,800
where um in addition to heat really Dro

284
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:44,759
might in fact be one of these key uh

285
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,759
drivers of of Rapid evolutionary change

286
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,679
so evolutionary change that we see not

287
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,399
over millions of years but of A Sort

288
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,278
small number of

289
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:58,000
generations and this is work that I've

290
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:00,200
started uh actually from a western USA

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,639
where there was this exceptional drought

292
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,399
that happened in California between 2010

293
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,959
and

294
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,600
2016 and so uh this plant uh Scarlet

295
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,559
monkey flower or MOS card analysis found

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,200
throughout California and into Southern

297
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,119
Oregon um which as you can see in 2010

298
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,399
was fairly drought free there was some

299
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,600
drought in perhaps uh Nevada and Arizona

300
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,078
um and so you can think of a population

301
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,079
occurring anywhere across this range as

302
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,278
perhaps having some amount of genetic

303
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,039
makeup where there were perhaps more a

304
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,320
wet adapted that the time because

305
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,439
there've been there it was generally

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
Mediterranean climate where you get the

307
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,160
rains that come in in the winter and you

308
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,519
get a uh adaptation to having access to

309
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,879
this flowing water in this riparian

310
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,000
plant um but there might be some amount

311
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,919
of genetic variation for uh various uh

312
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,320
drought resistance uh genes weeds

313
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,439
whatever they might be um but the

314
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,800
severity of this drought was exceptional

315
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,760
and it wasn't just that any one year was

316
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,439
particularly severe but that year after

317
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,159
year essentially in some parts of the

318
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,680
South just water almost sto flowing

319
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,679
entirely in some of these repairing

320
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,559
areas and there was just really much

321
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,559
more uh selection pressure in the center

322
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,198
of the range as well than perhaps the

323
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:19,119
system had ever experienced um in terms

324
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,278
and so what we can think about my lab

325
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,639
really brings in both ecological and

326
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,639
evolutionary aspects together and so you

327
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,519
can see right here if each of these dots

328
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,278
here is one individual and this is a

329
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,360
this is a particular genetic makeup you

330
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
can see there's a crash in population

331
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,639
selections happening lots of individuals

332
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,320
are dying and the individuals that have

333
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,799
uh more dry adaptations are performing

334
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,160
better and reproducing more

335
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,799
um however this drought then continues

336
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,120
and continues and continues throughout

337
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,759
here and so there's many different

338
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,639
selection events that happen um and

339
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,559
ultimately this population is going to

340
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,360
able to survive um in many places we

341
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,159
found that soltion rescue was actually

342
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
occurring in other words there was this

343
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,278
correlation between the increase in

344
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,720
population size and the increase in

345
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:15,159
these um climate adapted uh Snips or

346
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,600
single nucy polymorphisms and so we

347
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,319
didn't know the exact genes that were

348
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
underlying this rather we did whole

349
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,639
genome sequencing and Associated

350
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:27,159
ultimately millions of these Snips two

351
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,680
particular existing climate layers um

352
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,799
because the Souther part southern part

353
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,198
of the range is already well drought

354
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,159
adapted and so we can make some

355
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,439
inference that spatial differences in

356
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,958
climate could ultimately help us find

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,480
parts of the genome that were perhaps uh

358
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,119
underlying adaptive areas um and so

359
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,079
largely we found we we found in a

360
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,278
surprising number of areas that this was

361
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,120
correlated uh this sort of rebound of

362
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,039
the populations was correlated to Rapid

363
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,959
Evolution and not just to the betterment

364
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,639
of the environment um so really it was

365
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,239
the um underly genetics that was a sort

366
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,919
of this key predictive factor which is

367
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,360
really interesting in that essentially

368
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,198
this demonstrates evolutionary rescue in

369
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,600
the wild with years of uh demographic

370
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,319
data as well as genomic data um with

371
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,600
something that's fairly rare within um

372
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,160
studying evolu uh contemporary evolution

373
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,320
in natural

374
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,719
systems and so this is the type of

375
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,600
approach largely that I did in my postto

376
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,440
just wrapping up now that I'm looking to

377
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,759
kind of bring forward into my research

378
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,440
program moving forward where it's really

379
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,360
looking at Evolution across climatic and

380
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,120
now follow genetic gradients because I

381
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,000
want to move away from one species frame

382
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,240
workk essentially this is a sample size

383
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,519
of one a species that we know is highly

384
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,360
genetically diverse and into a variety

385
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
of species that might have a variety of

386
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,360
amounts of genetic

387
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,159
diversity and so the targets will be uh

388
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,800
genomics is fair sort of kind of more

389
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,559
Universal in some ways and then we can

390
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,319
look at the the the genomes the

391
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,198
landscape genomics of various different

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,560
species but as well morphology life

393
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,159
history traits that can be critical uh

394
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,919
for sort of mismatches with temperature

395
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,799
with with the amount of drought as well

396
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,719
as potentially uh herbivory and

397
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,000
chemistry sort of work that I've done a

398
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,879
lot in my my PhD and I'm eager to bring

399
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,958
uh forward in uh my time here um

400
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,039
and so we think of it so far we have

401
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,799
this one species where I looked at the

402
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,639
series of populations across Western

403
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,439
North America but really to get more

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,159
insights forh happens it would be useful

405
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,360
to compare it to a closely related

406
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,519
species that might also have um perhaps

407
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,639
certain Geographic and or trait

408
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,278
differences and to try to understand if

409
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,318
this other closely related species is it

410
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,318
also see uh showing many of the EV rapid

411
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,679
evolutionary responses that this first

412
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,479
species

413
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:56,758
is and as you can guess here I have a

414
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,319
philogyny and so I'm going to sort

415
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,959
of talk about these in detail but just

416
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,719
first focusing on this one what might we

417
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,518
expect happens when you have two

418
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,079
organisms that are relatively similar

419
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,720
Geographic environment perhaps some of

420
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,719
the underlying population history or the

421
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,680
traits that they experience themselves

422
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,199
or the type of Micro environments in

423
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,318
which they live in in these natural

424
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,318
populations might might mean that on the

425
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:23,838
whole maybe they're performing similarly

426
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,958
because they're fairly similar in these

427
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,319
regards or maybe there's something kind

428
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,439
of unique about what they're what what

429
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,838
they're ultimately doing so perhaps in a

430
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,680
different environment in in the the

431
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,440
prairies or here in in the east coast um

432
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,399
where perhaps we might see def different

433
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,360
evolutionary outcomes when you compare a

434
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,519
closely related species are inhabiting

435
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,318
similar environments and so that's going

436
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,679
to be a big thrust in my my uh program

437
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,439
moving forward uh finding species where

438
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm able to uh essentially get a

439
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,720
combination of of different resources to

440
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,679
try to be able to see over space and

441
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,440
ultimately over time what's happening

442
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,000
these populations and how they're

443
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,038
performing over the p over the last few

444
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,480
years and then potentially deeper into

445
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,640
time and this is going to be potentially

446
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,759
done through a combination of seed

447
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,640
collection and herbarium samples now I

448
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,119
was very fortunate to have uh extensive

449
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,880
collecting that was done within mimulus

450
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,798
however um I can't really you know build

451
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,720
a time machine and so the best we can do

452
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,599
is to try to find other systems

453
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,279
where the seeds have already been

454
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,519
collected and I could sort of use those

455
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,759
resources or to start planning now for

456
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,558
the next 5 10 15 20 years in the future

457
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,359
throughout my career to build those

458
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,720
Baseline samples and so the strategy is

459
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,439
going to be a little bit mixed currently

460
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,120
there are some seed collections of 50 or

461
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
so species that were done around the

462
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,239
2010s they they're already giving some

463
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,640
amount of

464
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,359
um of of time but then also pairing

465
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,840
these up with herbarium samples that um

466
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:03,759
have been uh they're available perhaps

467
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:07,439
going on to the 1900s and in fact our

468
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,759
herian collection here um has many

469
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,640
samples that are from the particularly

470
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,038
Rich from the 1880s to 1930s and so I've

471
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200
spent quite a bit of time this term sort

472
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,079
of looking at certain Target species

473
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,960
where I have both the seeds and also

474
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,798
potentially large swats of herbarium

475
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,558
samples and sort of the Prof of concept

476
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,599
here is blacke Susan where there I have

477
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:34,440
seeds available deeply sampled from

478
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,000
around uh 2014 across the luno gradient

479
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,159
and then there's many many herbarium

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,640
samples just from this herar Malone from

481
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,520
the 1880s to

482
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,720
1920s um and so there's the potential

483
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,839
then to do some um ancient or near

484
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,000
Ancient DNA sequencing to ultimately

485
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,038
come up with comparisons um and then the

486
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,759
challenge will be as I developed this

487
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,839
system and potentially other systems as

488
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,558
well to try to get these new systems of

489
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,439
at least new to my life to ultimately

490
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:05,079
grow well in in in various Greenhouse or

491
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,000
or grow Chambers or even in the field um

492
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,158
which is something you all appreciate in

493
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,919
in horiculture and something that I'll

494
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,400
be um myself and my lab will be engaging

495
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,520
in in the coming years as we uh seek to

496
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,440
expand out beyond the sort of a one

497
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:22,038
system uh

498
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,960
framework and with that I'm happy to

499
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,919
take any questions these are the variety

500
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,600
of different habitats in California that

501
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,360
I've that I've sampled for m cardels

502
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,879
yeah can you infer anything about draw

503
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,359
tolerance from morphological traits on

504
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,360
these aarian specimens that go back 100

505
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:43,558
years or so is that too difficult it's

506
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,199
an interesting question um so have some

507
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,158
of the work that I've done already with

508
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,038
sort of

509
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,039
morphological myself and my colleagues

510
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,440
have done we we looked at simple things

511
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:55,000
like SLA and then I had a colleague that

512
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,919
was looking at the actual number of

513
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,159
cells and the thickness of the misail

514
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,759
and all these kind of more functional

515
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,120
characteris sticks um I don't know it'

516
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,000
be interesting to see if we could

517
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,918
section A dried uh leaf and actually get

518
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,519
any useful information out of it it's

519
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,679
been challenging enough to do it on mass

520
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,558
kind of at scale across populations

521
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,320
within a just a living cell really

522
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,200
because it's if we're going to be

523
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,119
quantitative it's a lot of work but

524
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,798
that's an interesting idea um in terms

525
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,199
of phology yeah there there's always

526
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,679
potential to uh say something about

527
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,840
flowering time for example in terms of

528
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,679
when herbarium samples were collected

529
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:32,399
the awkward bit is that you only have

530
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,679
the bias of whoever was collecting at

531
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,559
the time and when they were collecting

532
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
and so you're in a case where you're

533
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,839
inferring across a variety of missing

534
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
data types but I mean there are

535
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,000
protocols that that help sort of take

536
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,200
uncertainty and and and deal with it in

537
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,919
potentially meaningful ways so perhaps

538
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
so I think a certain amount of it will

539
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,960
depend on the amount of student interest

540
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I have in morphology versus genomics as

541
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,759
as I start recruiting members to my

542
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,840
lab well um thank you Jos and thank you

543
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,519
B for the invite um and thank you all

544
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,480
for the attention uh my name is vien

545
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,798
Kumar um and I'm associate professor

546
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,759
with soil and crop science uh my

547
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,720
appointment with the section is research

548
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,200
and extension 60% research and 40%

549
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,038
extension and I do work with the

550
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,720
producers Consultants industry partners

551
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,480
and other stakeholders in the State uh

552
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,600
as well as in the northeastern uh States

553
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,599
in terms of weed management issues so

554
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,839
I'm going to talk about

555
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,639
uh some projects we have started uh this

556
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,240
is my second year we wrapped up our

557
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
second growing season uh and I work in

558
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,919
field crops so I'm going to talk about

559
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:46,319
some wheed control projects we have

560
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,679
started uh in field crops so first of

561
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:52,639
first first one is uh talking about new

562
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,080
weed species in the State uh and you

563
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,000
guys might have seen or been heard about

564
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,038
palar raren or Pig weeds uh there are

565
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,599
two new species have arrived in the

566
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,519
state Palmer amarand and water hemp uh

567
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,359
the first two pictur you see those are

568
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:14,240
Palmer in florescence one is a male one

569
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:16,558
is a female uh the one uh the second

570
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
picture is Mike stard our cornal

571
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,319
Cooperative Extension uh Team lead for

572
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,399
Western New York uh he was scouting some

573
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,158
field this growing season and asked me

574
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,038
to come and we found some new reports of

575
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,600
fmer

576
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,400
in Yates and Ontario County these are

577
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,959
this growing season from soybean and

578
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,960
corn and Al Alfa uh fields we had like

579
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,880
six different grower Fields where we saw

580
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,480
palaram Rand so these two pictures on

581
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,960
the on my side is a water hemp another

582
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,360
Pig weed uh highly invasive highly

583
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,319
problematic uh both Pig weeds are

584
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:56,479
basically uh very very problematic in

585
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:59,240
Midwest and other southeastern states

586
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,278
but also has arrived now in the New York

587
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,038
so what we are trying to uh do is we are

588
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,679
characterizing these populations uh for

589
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,839
any kind of uh herbicide resistance

590
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,840
Evolutions we are doing uh Greenhouse

591
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,959
testing we are doing some field

592
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,359
experiments uh looking at different uh

593
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,278
herbicides and example here in this

594
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:22,199
slide is we are doing some dose response

595
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,400
studies looking at uh glyphosate

596
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,600
resistance and if you see there's a New

597
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,440
York population and Nebraska population

598
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,798
side by side comparison for water

599
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,120
uh showing resistance to Durango which

600
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,558
is a GL glyphosate active uh commonly

601
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,399
used in our field crop

602
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:43,480
systems the picture on my side is my

603
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,278
graduate student uh henriquez Katina is

604
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:50,519
a master student uh under myself and Dr

605
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,480
Lyn soski holding a waterham plant this

606
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:57,200
is a glyphosate resistant waterham uh

607
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,839
plant near waterl uh growing in in in

608
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,840
soybean he is looking at some option

609
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,240
herbicide option that we can use

610
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,278
alternate options pre and post herbicide

611
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,440
options as well as looking at the the

612
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,720
growth as well as

613
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,080
reproductive uh characteristics of some

614
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,000
of these herbicide resistant

615
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,558
population along with those uh you know

616
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,759
water hemp and palaram R we have also

617
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:26,398
been testing some um some grass pces

618
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:29,000
like annual Ry grass uh these are uh

619
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:32,639
some population came from grow Fields

620
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,720
were using an Ry grass as a cover crop

621
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,520
and those cover crops they were not able

622
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,278
to terminate with glyphosate so they

623
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,960
have be becoming uh a problem now as a

624
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,278
weed uh we are testing those along with

625
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,319
those species we are also investigating

626
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,679
other problematic species like clam

627
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:52,798
squatter common Ragweed giant Ragweed uh

628
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,360
some other grasses like fox tail so this

629
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:59,319
is a kind of long-term ongoing projects

630
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:02,000
got funded by uh hatch and with L funds

631
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,439
this year and we are trying to uh look

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,319
at as a regional approach from other

633
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,159
states as well multi-state project uh

634
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,398
characterizing resistance and locating

635
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,000
those resistance population in the

636
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,158
Northeast another example is a horse

637
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,278
weed population this is a very uh

638
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,000
typical response we are seeing in horse

639
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,679
weed population from New York this is a

640
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,079
population we collected actually been uh

641
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:31,200
sent by our CCE uh folks from Central

642
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,839
New York New York and we've been testing

643
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,679
this different herbicides again commonly

644
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,639
used herbicides in soybean and corn uh

645
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,000
we are seeing issues with the Roundup as

646
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,559
you see here on on the picture compared

647
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,720
to the non-treated we have soybean

648
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,639
products like Cobra synchrony even corn

649
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,839
products like Kalisto showing issues

650
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,320
with the controlling these horse weed uh

651
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,119
population very consistent response we

652
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,240
have 10 population screen so far similar

653
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,239
response we have been seeing

654
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,798
uh these are again the pictures of

655
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,000
annual Ry grass just sent by The Growers

656
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,240
you see the picture on the very left

657
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,359
from last year this is a same field in

658
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,558
this growing season where he had wheat

659
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,558
and he's been dealing with this

660
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,599
glyphosate resistant anal rra uh we're

661
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,558
trying to figure out what alternate

662
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,599
options alternate methods we can employ

663
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:26,319
and we have together a afre grant just

664
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,678
to look at the wheat seed bank

665
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,079
Management in wheat soybean rotation

666
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,200
what that producer can use in the middle

667
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,639
picture is again another uh annual Ry

668
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,960
grass cover crop was not getting

669
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,799
terminated with the two shots of Roundup

670
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,880
in Ontario County so you can see very

671
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:47,200
quickly some of these cover crops can

672
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,039
also be a problematic as as a

673
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,798
weeds so along with along with those

674
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,000
herbicide resistance screening and

675
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:57,839
testing and and characterizing we also

676
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,359
looking at Field Works uh at especially

677
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,439
productive evaluation program looking at

678
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:06,479
alternate option as I said uh we want to

679
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,320
give producers uh the immediate options

680
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,038
they can use to control these herbicide

681
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,319
resistant weed populations uh these are

682
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,879
pictures we have uh one of my graduate

683
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,359
students looking at options herbicide

684
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,520
options in different trade Technologies

685
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,158
like conventional corn or Roundup Ready

686
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,359
corn what options do we have to control

687
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,440
glyphosate resistant waterham this is a

688
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,558
picture from way County uh producer

689
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,600
growing a conventional corn a silage

690
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,918
corn what options do we have to control

691
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,000
this glyphosate resistant water hem

692
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,120
similarly these are producers on Farm

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,599
studies we are looking at options like a

694
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,678
pre pre-applied as well as post applied

695
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,759
herbicide options uh for controlling

696
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
glyphosate resistant water Hamp as well

697
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,278
as other wheat

698
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,240
species in additions to product

699
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:55,880
evaluation or herbicide based weed

700
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,679
control we are also looking at

701
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,919
non-chemical weed control tactics uh

702
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:04,080
this is my graduate student PhD student

703
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,640
looking at side by-side comparisons on

704
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,839
Innovative uh weed control tactics such

705
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,679
as inter overs electric weer as well as

706
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,759
harvest wheat seed control how those

707
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:19,278
tactics we can integrate into our system

708
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:23,079
as as a as a holistic approach for

709
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,079
targeting those wheat seed bank

710
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,919
management so this is again uh another

711
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,399
way of looking things from the system

712
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,960
standpoint uh we are integrating some of

713
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,239
our procision act tools one of my PhD

714
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,038
student uh also looking at prision neck

715
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,079
uh tools such as the sensors and cameras

716
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:45,599
how we can use the Drone based imagery

717
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,240
to detect and identify weed species in

718
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,639
the fields and that information can be

719
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,919
used to make decisions for controlling

720
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,919
those weeds because artificial

721
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,679
intelligence is quite popular now and we

722
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:00,038
want to use that technology uh to

723
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,600
identif ify and manage these weeds more

724
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,679
site specifically and species

725
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,879
specifically uh looking at these

726
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,440
integrating these chemical non-chemical

727
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,600
weed control strategies as I said some

728
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,679
of these projects been funded by USD

729
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:17,199
Anda looking at multi tactic approach

730
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,519
including cultural practices including P

731
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,080
season EG including mechanical

732
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,079
approaches like Harvest wheed seed

733
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,519
control overall I guess my uh overall

734
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,239
for the research and extension program

735
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:37,880
is to develop sustainable and economical

736
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,519
iwm uh strategies for the producers as I

737
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,000
mentioned my program looking at

738
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,120
different aspects uh looking at the

739
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,278
cultural chemical prison egg and

740
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,000
mechanical uh tactics how we can

741
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,880
integrate them together to help

742
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,480
producers to make those decision how to

743
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,000
control these uh tough to control weed

744
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,200
species uh I have not put together any

745
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,159
slide for my funding agencies but

746
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,440
there's a lot of support from uh New

747
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,519
York corn soybean producers uh industry

748
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,960
Partners as well as USDA Nea I've been

749
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,319
working closely with some

750
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,880
multi-institutional uh teams like a grow

751
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:18,839
team which is called getting rid of

752
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:22,278
weeds uh run by USDA ARS uh Dr Steven

753
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:24,558
mki at Maryland so we are educating

754
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,359
producers on some of these issues and

755
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,798
helping them to make some of those

756
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:31,879
decisions how to control these uh tough

757
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,798
to control weeds that's my last slide

758
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,039
thank

759
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,240
you yes I I wondering about this for the

760
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,679
second time so I'll ask you now your

761
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,000
your picture of the I think it was the

762
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,120
horse weed control it actually looks

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,038
like the glyphosate treatment is more

764
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,158
vigorous than the untreated control is

765
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,398
it conceivable that the resist

766
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,960
population somehow grows even better in

767
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:59,038
the presence of glyphosate excellent

768
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,480
question um it's a visual thing yeah

769
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,440
absolutely we haven't done any work to

770
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,639
look at closely uh but there are

771
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,960
examples in the literature that shows

772
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:12,959
that because of resistance mechanisms uh

773
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,319
we don't know what mechanism we have uh

774
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:20,159
there are there are examples in uh in

775
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,678
GMO rice that has shown with mutations

776
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,519
with the increase in copy number epsps

777
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,960
Gene copy number that is the mechanism

778
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,519
of resistance to glyphosate in those GMO

779
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,000
rise they have found increase in yield

780
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,880
they have found increase in growth so

781
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,519
that is called Fitness uh we will be

782
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,600
doing some Fitness studies to look at

783
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
the fitness cost if there is a cost or

784
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,599
there's no cost or there is a benefit of

785
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,240
that Fitness uh some of those uh things

786
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:49,959
help us to devise strategies how we can

787
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,839
Implement our weed control tactics

788
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,360
definitely ex excellent question and

789
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:57,480
being from weat Science Background we

790
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:01,000
have done some of that work in koshia

791
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,839
where we did not find any Fitness cost

792
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,679
due to glyphosate

793
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:08,199
resistance but again these population we

794
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,880
are dealing with the in in these water

795
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,319
hem farmer or horse weed uh there are

796
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,360
probably not only resistance to

797
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,038
glyphosate but multiple resistance to

798
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,879
other chemistries so especially

799
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,158
resistance to axenics like 240 damba we

800
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,880
have seen there's a fitness cost so it's

801
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,000
a matter of what resistance we are

802
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,519
talking and what mechanism we are

803
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,720
talking that can determine their the

804
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,440
fitness any any other

805
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,880
question I have sure so they PL biology

806
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,600
lightning series on Friday Jenny Moore

807
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,120
from plant breeding genetics gave a

808
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,038
pitch on her program around breeding for

809
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,199
sustainable cover crops right but you're

810
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:50,960
talking about the problem of they're

811
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,759
becoming too sustainable right so

812
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,440
they're weeding so in terms of adoption

813
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,240
of cover crops how much is weediness

814
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,440
really

815
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,200
huge so this this plan the annual dry

816
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,200
grass I'm talking in general is tough to

817
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,080
control tough to terminate if you're

818
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,840
using a cover crop and there is a

819
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,119
specific guidelines if you're going to

820
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,519
use a chemical to terminate these cover

821
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,079
crops uh what we are trying to educate

822
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,278
producers if you're going to use this as

823
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,359
a cover crop you know be proactive when

824
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,480
the when you're going to terminate make

825
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,038
a better plans what weather conditions

826
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,798
you going to have when you're going to

827
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,679
apply those glyphosate to terminate it

828
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:31,918
in general irrespective of resistance

829
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,679
this plant is hard to control uh and we

830
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,720
are trying to educate like this is a

831
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,038
closely related species to Italian Rass

832
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,600
producers in the South they are dealing

833
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,839
with this more

834
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:46,319
aggressively uh because they be they

835
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,918
were using an orass as a c crop and and

836
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,079
the problem there is uh some of these

837
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:56,120
seed companies are selling uh the Anor

838
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,558
grass as a VNS variety not specified uh

839
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,918
there are mixtures coming from the

840
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,720
some of those seed bags are having you

841
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,120
know varieties from different regions

842
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,398
and that cause problem um I don't know I

843
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,358
have exact answer uh how we can you know

844
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:14,319
increase the adoption but there are

845
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,838
species which are perfectly fit in terms

846
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
of you know if you're going to use

847
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,159
chemical to terminate those but there

848
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,200
are other methods to terminate those

849
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,039
cover crops uh definitely cover crops

850
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,199
are foundations for suppressions weed

851
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,279
suppression uh folks in the New York

852
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,199
state are are pretty excited about other

853
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,679
benefits but I think weed expression is

854
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,799
again top top benefit uh producers in

855
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,039
the Midwest and other uh States they are

856
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,960
looking for and adopting cover crops

857
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:46,320
especially Cedar if we if we talk about

858
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,838
Cedar so yeah I guess depending on the

859
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,960
goals of adopting cover crops or growing

860
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,719
cover crops it depends how you're going

861
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,720
to terminate and that's what we trying

862
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,959
to educate plan properly what you

863
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,480
growing for what you growing and you

864
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,639
going to handle this okay yeah great

865
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,639
thank

866
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,880
you this has been a production of
