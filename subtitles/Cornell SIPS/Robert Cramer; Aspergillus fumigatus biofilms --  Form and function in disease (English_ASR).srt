1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,759
University so um thank you Lori and the

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,480
department for having me here it's my

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
first time over to Ithaca I really

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,199
enjoyed my drive over yesterday as I was

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,079
telling Lori I don't get a lot of time

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,519
alone and so the sixh hour drive

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,599
actually was

9
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,759
fantastic uh and it was a beautiful day

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,640
I couldn't believe how warm it was when

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
I got here so um yeah so we're g to talk

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
about aspir jillis today I know perhaps

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,519
maybe an organism that you don't hear a

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,000
lot about um here at Cornell but I was a

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
card carrying plant pathologist uh at

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,719
one time and so this was I had fun

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,238
pulling this paper it was my very first

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,320
paper I published as a graduate student

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,558
I worked on this in the late 90s using a

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,000
technique that the students probably

21
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,000
don't even know what it is anymore

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,920
random Amplified polymorphic DNA markers

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,159
to look at the genetic diversity of

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,440
ferum exist from isolates isolated from

25
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,439
common bean and sugar beats in the

26
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,479
Central High Plains region which is

27
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,159
Colorado um wyom

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,319
and Nebraska so that was a big part of

29
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,359
my graduate school work and then I moved

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,559
on and we did some functional genomics

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,118
analyses in this really interesting

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,079
interaction between alterar brat ofle

33
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,680
and a rabid opsis and so what I thought

34
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,158
was you know really exciting about this

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,040
work was the fact that alternaria was an

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,079
actual primary pathogen of of a

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,840
arabidopsis unlike early days some of

38
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:27,118
the systems that were being worked on um

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,400
at the time and so we thought that was a

40
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,680
nice introduction into how these basa

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
causing the these disease of the Brasa

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,640
plants were being mediated by the

43
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,199
alterar eugenus and so again grad

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
students we use things called Express

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,040
sequence tags back then which you

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,200
probably don't know what those are

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,799
either anymore thankfully because you

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,079
can do things like RNA seek now um so

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,920
why am I here and what do I do and in

50
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,599
and as far as the students in postdocs

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,399
go I'm happy to talk about how I ended

52
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,759
up switching into human fungal

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,960
pathogenesis during my postto at lunch

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,399
if you want to hear that story um but um

55
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,319
really we ask very similar questions to

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
what you ask when you're trying to

57
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,919
understand how fungi caused disease of

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
plants and part of that reason is is

59
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,719
because antifungal therapies are not

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,519
effective in a significant proportion of

61
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,318
patients that have these invasive fungal

62
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,599
infections just like fungal pathogens of

63
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,119
plants cause significant crop losses

64
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,399
throughout the world despite use of

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,680
antifungals and other management

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,840
practices so these organisms remain a Hu

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
a huge

68
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,759
problem so kind of a big thing for our

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,120
field I mean most of you when you woke

70
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,759
up this morning you probably weren't

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,158
thinking about getting a an infection by

72
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,959
a fungus and when I first was introduced

73
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,598
to that fact that fungi might cause

74
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,158
disease in humans as a graduate student

75
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,598
um when I made the switch I was like

76
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,799
what really like it's just not something

77
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,359
fortunately most of us grow up worrying

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,439
about and so recently the World Health

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,040
Organization though has recognized now

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
fungi as a critical group of pathogens

81
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,079
to study and so in 2022

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,360
the who came out with their critical

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,680
priority group and so the organism that

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,519
we work on we're going to talk about

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,879
today aspil Huma goddess is the mold but

86
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,239
you see Canada Albans and Canada orus

87
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,439
these are yeasts and cryptococcus is a

88
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,959
fascinating fungus it's a bidom my se

89
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,359
but it also was a

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,640
yeast and so why why did the who

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,799
suddenly in 2022 become interested in

92
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,878
these infections and that's because

93
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,438
medicine has changed and the world has

94
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,359
changed dramatically with climate change

95
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,199
as well as advances and immun therapy

96
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,200
and so many of the chronic diseases that

97
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,280
we treat in the clinic now the therapies

98
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,958
we use to treat those diseases Target

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,799
the immune system and so what we're

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,920
seeing is an increase in infections

101
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,959
caused by these fungi but as plant

102
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,359
Pathologists you know these fungi are

103
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,598
everywhere but yet we only you know not

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,680
only but we see predominantly these four

105
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,438
organisms showing up in these patients

106
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,799
so there's something unique about their

107
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:00,878
biology that allows them to cause

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,159
disease in a Mamon host so just quickly

109
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,078
asilis like the screen's a little bit

110
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:09,120
behind there we go a little bit of a

111
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,159
delay um ASP regillus was discovered in

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,840
1729 I always like to talk about it's

113
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,598
named after the aspergillum um if

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,519
there's any Catholics in the audience

115
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:22,199
that's the the the the the holy water

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,600
sprinkler and so you can see the kapor

117
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,079
which is the asexual uh development

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,800
structure of the organism looks just

119
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,439
like the ASP Gillum he was a priest so

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,319
there you go aspil

121
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:36,279
asilis as the genus and then fumigatus

122
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,319
is Latin for smoke and so this is a

123
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,599
culture of ASP regillus fagus grown in

124
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:46,159
the lab and this green coloration here

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,160
is the canidia and it comes from a a a

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,880
molecule called dhn melanin that

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,199
actually happens to be a veilance factor

128
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,639
for the organism but importantly those

129
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,000
canid are coated in hydrophobins and

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,000
those hydrophobins make the organism the

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,399
canidia very hydrophobic and so they

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,199
disperse into to the air uh and so if

133
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,839
you take a plate of aspergillis and you

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,478
just open the lid you see smoke come off

135
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,038
and that's where it got it's named fuma

136
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,680
Godus for for smoke it causes a pretty

137
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,680
broad spectrum of disease um and so that

138
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,319
you know we're going to talk about

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,199
invasive aspergillosis today which is a

140
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,720
systemic infection but chronic

141
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,280
aspergillosis is increasing in frequency

142
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
now um and there's many manifestations

143
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,239
of aspil Lois that relate to what's

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,360
called a th2 type response or

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,120
so it's an organism that causes a very

146
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,319
wide spectrum of human disease in a lot

147
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,199
of different patient

148
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,919
populations so this is a CT scan uh from

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,360
a from a patient at Memorial SLO

150
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,758
ketering Hospital not over in New York

151
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,439
City and it's from one of the patients

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,800
of my collaborator uh Dr Tobias Hull and

153
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,478
what I'm trying to illustrate on this

154
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,960
slide is that ASP regillus one is a

155
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,959
pulmonary pathogen and so in red you can

156
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,159
see one of these lesions forming in this

157
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,638
patient's lung

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,880
and the Crux of the matter is is that

159
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,478
our optimal antifungal therapies which

160
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,360
aren't that effective in Vivo have to

161
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,000
Target the organism in the right

162
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,280
physiological

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,199
context and in our field that that that

164
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,679
that's

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,199
actually a significant

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,759
challenge um and so how do you actually

167
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,639
identify infection micro environment

168
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,280
relevant Therapeutics and a little bit

169
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,079
of a maybe a bit of a spoil ER for later

170
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,879
in the talk but the way we've done this

171
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,680
in our field for years and as plant

172
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
Pathologists you do this too when you go

173
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,840
to inoculate a plant with an organism is

174
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,879
there's a big bottleneck here to get

175
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,478
these um you know morbidity and survival

176
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,199
curves or plant death curves with our

177
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:50,879
mutant fungus this is the result you

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,360
want to get right so you make a fungal

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,959
mutant using fungal genetic approaches

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
and you hope that that mutant doesn't

181
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,638
cause disease in your animal or your

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,599
plant and you get this beautiful

183
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,160
survival curve and you get papers and

184
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:06,918
grants and you identified a drug Target

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,080
but the problem with this is that often

186
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,359
in the what is often the case is to get

187
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,359
a curve like this you fail to initiate

188
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,560
an infection so these mutants tend to be

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,319
very sick and they are incapable of

190
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,038
initiating that infection and so in the

191
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,319
agricultural setting that could be very

192
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,918
powerful right you could easily develop

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,199
something you could spray on crops for

194
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,799
example to prevent Spore germination or

195
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,560
prevent the development of an aoria that

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,598
you know initiates the infection but in

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,598
a Maman system we can't predict who's

198
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,639
going to get one of these infections and

199
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:47,000
so prophylactic therapies are less um

200
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,000
are less a less viable alternative for

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,319
developing new Therapeutics for these

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,959
diseases so what happens is is the

203
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,520
individual gets an infection that's been

204
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,878
established and then we have to treat it

205
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,439
okay so we wrote a little piece on like

206
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,759
just talking about the importance of

207
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,240
these high impact virulence factors

208
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,680
which are important for initiation of an

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,478
infection but really unclear in almost

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
every case because we don't really have

211
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,719
the great tools to look at an

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,479
established infection we're not sure if

213
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
they're disease progression factors

214
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,158
because this is what you'd really want

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,720
to Target when you get sick you go to

216
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,240
the doctor after you get sick so we need

217
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,120
to treat these infections in in in this

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
in in a different context than we often

219
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,479
are studying them so how we approach

220
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,519
this in my lab and so one of the ways is

221
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,519
we've gone in to try and profile the

222
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,120
infection micro environment this is an

223
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,278
old experiment it was one of the last

224
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,799
ones I did as a postto with this idea in

225
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,838
mind to try and understand what the

226
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,559
physiology of the fungus was in an

227
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,880
established infection so a bit of a busy

228
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,879
slide it's a it's a 1nmr Spectra and so

229
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,039
we have animals that were inoculated

230
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,559
with just saline and then animals where

231
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,000
we give ASP regillus the canidia through

232
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,679
the airway right right so they just

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,919
inhale the spores they run around they

234
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,639
just inhale the spores and then in the

235
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,799
lung what we did is you can actually get

236
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,919
fluid out of the lung all the Bal

237
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,199
bronchial

238
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,439
alage right and you can take that fluid

239
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,800
and we did metabolomics on it and we got

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,560
a big surprise and the surprise was is

241
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,359
these red arrows are metabolites

242
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,838
associated with fermentation

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,919
particularly ethanol so lactate alanine

244
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,640
acetate those are all metabolites that

245
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,078
likely are coming from the host so we

246
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,159
can't rule out that the fungus isn't is

247
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,958
is making those in Vivo but the ethanol

248
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,838
the ethanol we knew had to be coming

249
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,559
from the Fungus and so this really was

250
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,279
the piece of data that I started my lab

251
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,359
on because the the idea was is that when

252
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:49,759
do microbes ferment most microbes okay

253
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,320
they ferment when oxygen becomes limied

254
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,519
and so you might be thinking well wait a

255
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,879
minute you're in the lung you're talking

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,200
about an obligate aerobic filamentous

257
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,039
fungus and you're telling me that it's

258
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,240
fermenting and it doesn't it grows in

259
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,360
the absence of oxygen or at least with

260
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,839
limited oxygen environments but I would

261
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,639
argue that aspergillis and a lot of our

262
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
filament of fungi that we study out in

263
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,519
the soil they're really good at

264
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,278
recycling carbon and nitrogen for most

265
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,320
of them that's their ecological role and

266
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,480
in compost piles it's the number one

267
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
place where we could go out and get

268
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,360
environmental isolates of aspila hum

269
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,200
Godus when you turn over your compost

270
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,839
pile and you see the smoke come out the

271
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,320
spores a lot of those are pagus for a

272
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,240
couple reason reasons one it's

273
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,600
thermotolerant it's one of the few

274
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,919
Thermo tolerant filament of fungi it can

275
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,879
survive up to temperatures of 70 de C it

276
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:44,039
can grow in the lab at temperatures at

277
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,838
55 degrees C very rare for the

278
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,159
molds secondly if you go to your garden

279
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,560
store what do they try and sell you they

280
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,439
try and sell you devices to oxygenate

281
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:57,359
your compost to speed up microbial

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,040
metabolism to degrade the compost faster

283
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,159
which tells you that compost become

284
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,838
oxygen depleted very rapidly due to

285
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,879
microbial metabolism so aspergilus it

286
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,959
turns out also grows very even though

287
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,078
it's an obligate AE it will not grow

288
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,958
anerobic but it can live anerobic

289
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,239
it loves to grow in these low oxygen

290
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,479
environments okay so what we ended up

291
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,200
finding you know at first no one

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,720
believed us but you know the ethanol

293
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,720
data we went and showed them we used the

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,160
tool from cancer okay so in cancer

295
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,360
hypoxia or oxygen deficiency is a really

296
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,399
important part of the tumor that confers

297
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,079
drug resistance to a lot of cancer

298
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,639
therapies so as as tumors develop they

299
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,599
become hypoxic in the middle so there's

300
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,000
tools to investigate that so we showed

301
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,759
this is a lung so here's an airway the

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
aspergillus came in through the airway

303
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:51,439
the green is ASP regillus growing out in

304
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,000
the lung tissue and the red now is um

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
showing you a region of the lung that's

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,799
defici in oxygen okay so it's it's

307
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,120
called pidol hydrochloride it forms

308
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,799
protein adox On th res res only when

309
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,519
oxygen levels drop below

310
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,958
1.5% so at the site of infection just

311
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,879
like in a compost pile the organism is

312
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,319
is having to deal with these low oxygen

313
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,278
environments okay so an important Point

314
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,959
here is that hypoxia was recently

315
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,480
awarded the Nobel Prize for how mammals

316
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,599
another obligate aerobe how they respond

317
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,879
and sense oxygen levels through the hif

318
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,519
one alpha pathway really beautiful

319
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,360
science it's a really cool mechanism

320
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,560
related to pral hydroxylase which is

321
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,440
uses oxygen as a co-actor to hydroxate

322
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,399
hif one when Oxygen's abundant then when

323
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,720
it drops you don't get the protein

324
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,958
hydroxy and the transcription Factor can

325
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,320
go activate the hypoxia response but and

326
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,679
I think this is relevant for Plant

327
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Pathology is it oxygen demand hypoxia

328
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,879
occurs the physiological response when

329
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,040
oxygen demand exceeds the supply so that

330
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,519
can occur at any oxygen level and so

331
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,679
when different fungi induce a hypoxia

332
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,399
response really depends on their oxy

333
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,838
requirements and the oxygen levels in a

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,720
given environment okay so something to

335
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,480
think

336
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,000
about and so we studied this for years

337
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
um a lot of papers you know we really

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,958
got really lucky we found this

339
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,240
transcription Factor called srba that um

340
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,000
as you can see when you make a null

341
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,720
mutant it cannot grow in hypoxia it's

342
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,440
the dream result it's why I'm still here

343
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,440
it's why I ended up getting a job this

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,560
Gene I love so much we continue to study

345
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,680
it in different ways um so you you know

346
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,759
it abolishes hypoxia Fitness it

347
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,359
completely abolishes virulence of the

348
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,278
organism the nice thing here I'm not am

349
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,278
I showing you the data nope not showing

350
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,838
you the data but you know this actually

351
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:46,120
does initiate an infection this mutants

352
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,920
but then once the hypoxia sents in then

353
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,679
the mutant stops growing completely and

354
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,519
the animals are all able to survive so

355
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,599
we actually do have a project it's kind

356
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
of our latest paper looking at how to

357
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,519
Target this pathway

358
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,839
therapeutically it was a gift that kept

359
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,560
on giving because the AOL are the main

360
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,959
antifungal that we use in the clinic

361
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:09,039
just like in agriculture for antifungal

362
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,879
um activity um you can see that the

363
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,799
aspergilus wild type strain here is

364
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,399
completely resistant to azol but this

365
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,879
azol VOR conazol it's susceptible to so

366
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,039
that is the primary therapy in the

367
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,958
clinic if you get one of these

368
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,000
infections but our mutant was

369
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,719
susceptible to both lonol which is used

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,759
to treat yeast infections and then the

371
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,920
AOL so virulence drug susceptibility was

372
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:35,278
the best Gene I could have we were lucky

373
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,759
okay and um you know just to throw again

374
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,759
this that seems to happen in plant

375
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,480
fungal pathogenesis as well so these

376
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,680
this is the fermentation pathway in

377
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
fusarium that was shown by a group in

378
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,719
Spain to be really important for uh

379
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,000
causing fusarium

380
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,480
wilts uh which was which is exciting

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,198
which suggests that think about it so

382
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,839
where's are the roots full of oxygen

383
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,399
they're actually pretty oxygen deficient

384
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,040
especially when they get water locked

385
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,240
and so a lot of these root path

386
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,000
pathogens in particular must have to

387
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,759
deal with low oxygen environments and

388
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,198
able to thrive within a plant and then

389
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,680
um in Magna pora um uh Wong Hong Le's

390
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,359
group um actually ended up studying srba

391
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,679
in

392
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,800
magnaport um and show um that magnor as

393
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,198
it penetrates through the aium also

394
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,159
experiences an oxygen deficiency and it

395
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,399
was kind of fun I was at a GRC once and

396
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,198
Nick talbet was giving one of his

397
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,278
amazing talks looking in the tissue

398
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:31,679
watching um uh magnor invade and he was

399
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,399
losing gfp signal and he couldn't figure

400
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,879
it out like and I went to him I said

401
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,639
you're losing oxygen as you get into the

402
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:42,039
plant and uh so anyway really kind of

403
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,759
cool gfps requires oxygen to to

404
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,120
sense so that was all fine um I could

405
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,240
have talk I talk to you all day about

406
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,679
srba but we wanted to find um other we

407
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,480
had evidence to suggest that there were

408
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,919
other regulatory Pathways that were

409
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,440
dealing with the response to oxygen in

410
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,599
the fungus and so you know we um I've

411
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,600
talked to quite a few people this

412
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
morning about RNA seek and Lor's

413
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,560
teaching a class asking you students

414
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,560
that are in the class to look at an RNA

415
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,879
seek and pull jeans out make a

416
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,599
hypothesis and and and hopefully find a

417
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,439
gene that's related to a specific

418
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,920
function in phenotype it doesn't work

419
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,199
that often I hate to tell you it's very

420
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,879
frustrating um you can learn a lot from

421
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,318
RN seek experiments but often you know

422
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,480
the gene that's at the top of your list

423
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,838
isn't the one that's driving the

424
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,600
phenotype you're interested in and so we

425
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,440
went through that with low oxygen and we

426
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,199
ended up deciding to let the fun tell us

427
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,279
so long story short how we came about

428
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,120
this is we started screening

429
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,958
environmental and clinical isolates

430
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,480
another tip for students there's a lot

431
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,399
of genetic heterogenity within the

432
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,159
organism that you study and so we often

433
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,919
study reference strains for many years

434
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,719
uh in our in our respective Fields but

435
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,838
there's a lot of cool genetic diversity

436
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,680
out there you can do screens without

437
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,040
having to do any kind of recommed DNA

438
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,879
experience just go get a bunch of

439
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,599
isolates and screen for phenotypes and

440
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:00,278
now with genome sequencing as cheap as

441
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,278
it is um you can you can actually track

442
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,880
down the mutations that are causitive in

443
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,838
many cases but so that was our idea here

444
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,439
so we did we we set up an experimental

445
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,279
Evolution experiment with a clinical

446
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,679
isolate that really struggled to grow in

447
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,078
low oxygen environments compared to a

448
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,519
lot of the other strains that we had

449
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,838
looked at so we ended up

450
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,359
passaging uh the organism for about four

451
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,359
months under low oxygen environments we

452
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,318
passage the spores we collect the whole

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,038
population each passage to try and avoid

454
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,720
bottlenecks and uh we kept passaging

455
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:33,839
and we ended up this experiment just

456
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,319
kind of taking the lab in a in a very

457
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,159
different direction than one that we

458
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,798
were previously um working on which is

459
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,960
what what one of the fun things about

460
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:46,200
science is so we got a strain and as you

461
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,000
might expect um we did recover a strain

462
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,558
that became more fit under the low

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
oxygen environments that was the goal of

464
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,918
the

465
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
experiment you know if if you're

466
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,960
following along you might predict that

467
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,000
the strain

468
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,400
is a little bit more pathogenic right so

469
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,440
if low oxygen environment is important

470
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,798
for progressing disease um I actually

471
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,960
shouldn't say pathogenic I should say

472
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,599
virulent a little bit more ver okay so

473
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,360
the ability to cause the disease is the

474
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,000
same but the the progression of the

475
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,399
disease was increased more rapidly um

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,319
potentially because the strain is a

477
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,080
little bit more fit in that low oxygen

478
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,399
environment so those were all great

479
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,199
awesome the unexpected part that threw

480
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,720
us for a loop was this right here so if

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
you look here's the strain that we

482
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,839
passage the parental strain this is what

483
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,480
it look like in standard lab

484
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,359
conditions here's the strain that is

485
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,240
resulted from the experimental Evolution

486
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,798
experiment hopefully you can see there's

487
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,200
substantial change in the colony

488
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,720
morphology of the

489
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,279
strain what was interesting to us is

490
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,919
that the other condition where

491
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,158
irrespective of the evolution changes

492
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,280
Colony morphology is low oxygen we've

493
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,320
done a lot of experiments and the low

494
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,798
oxygen environment is one environmental

495
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,200
condition where we see these these

496
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,679
morphological changes within the

497
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,440
colony and so we really became curious

498
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,798
about the if this adaptation to the low

499
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,240
oxygen environment was being driven by

500
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,079
the change in Colony for was this

501
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,038
causitive or was it correlative um and

502
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,798
so we really dove in and started to

503
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
investigate this in order to do that we

504
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,079
had to quantify the morphology and so we

505
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,240
ended up um quantifying the amount of a

506
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,798
colony that is vegetative so not

507
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,919
undergoing asexual reproduction and then

508
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,000
one thing that was

509
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,120
repeatable was the development of these

510
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,720
furrows so these colonies that were

511
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,359
coming out of low oxygen always furrowed

512
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,360
so this rugos Colony the the micology

513
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,719
term is a rugos colony and you know

514
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,759
surprisingly if you look in the

515
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,079
literature there isn't hasn't been a lot

516
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,960
of as you know in bacteria there's been

517
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,279
a lot of work done associating different

518
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,120
Colony morphotypes with pathogenesis but

519
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:53,639
in the fungi less so so again functional

520
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,879
or just

521
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,038
coincidence so the the conceptual switch

522
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,080
here for us was that really started to

523
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,599
think about these colonies as

524
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:07,119
communities and that the structure of

525
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,199
the community um likely is is is driving

526
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,839
the emergent properties that arise when

527
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,759
you have a community of cells together

528
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,759
and so at the end of the day now we

529
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,798
started referring to the so you know

530
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,480
micology the term is a melium and

531
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,679
functionally in the bacterial World they

532
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,960
call these

533
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,640
biofilms so they communities of cells

534
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,759
attached to a surface that produce an

535
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,559
extracellular Matrix and so what I'm

536
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,200
showing you here is these colonies of

537
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,319
molds this isn't exclusive aspergillus

538
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,120
other molds do this too they make this

539
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,960
beautiful extracellular Matrix that

540
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,639
helps connect these colonies and these

541
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,279
filaments together and so by any

542
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,200
definition these mold colonies are a

543
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,200
biofilm and again going back to that CT

544
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,240
scan thinking about the physiological

545
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,798
environment in the host that the or that

546
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,279
we need to treat well here's an here's a

547
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,359
picture now of Josh where's Josh he's

548
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,558
right here during his PhD developed this

549
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,959
technique in our lab called funpack

550
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,200
where we're able to clear tissue and

551
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,240
then look at the fungus within the

552
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,200
tissue as for gillus after it initiates

553
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,519
infection when you're progressing the

554
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200
disease this is what you have to treat

555
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,440
is these

556
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,840
biofilms so they're adhered to the lung

557
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,080
tissue they're producing Matrix and

558
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,480
that's what you have to treat so

559
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,119
suddenly we like wow like we've maybe

560
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,558
been studying this from you know we

561
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,038
often study Fung look at the stress

562
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,119
response by kn ating canidia onto a

563
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,319
plate and so are you you know is the

564
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,038
stress response to the antifungal

565
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,439
killing the canidia or is it actually

566
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:41,640
impacting the Hy it can be hard to parse

567
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,159
that apart by using spot dilution

568
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,200
assays um and so this led to a lot of

569
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,159
questions for us so you know first um

570
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,120
what can biofilm morphology tell us

571
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,880
about the evolutionary pressures faced

572
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,959
by ASP regillus in the environment in

573
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,440
the

574
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,558
host and then how do these population

575
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,558
level scale morphotypes relate to spefic

576
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,278
specific phenotypic states that we care

577
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,599
about like virulence drug susceptibility

578
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,519
and then persistence within a a human

579
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,678
host or a plant

580
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,278
host um and then of course you know I'm

581
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,798
fungal genetics by training I love

582
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:15,440
genetics and so what are the genetic

583
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,200
mechanisms that facilitate the biofilm

584
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,320
Form and

585
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,319
Function and then you know home run

586
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,319
would be to identify small molecules

587
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,798
that Target these mechan because our

588
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,000
current antifungals are really

589
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,519
ineffective against the bioil state of

590
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,359
the organism

591
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,879
so um just kind of hammer home this

592
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,519
point that the environment thinking

593
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,520
about the evolutionary pressures the

594
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,319
organism face when we grow asparagus in

595
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,240
the lab the likely the reality is we're

596
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,558
growing it in a condition it does not

597
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,000
really face much in the environment it

598
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:51,359
does not see 21% oxygen okay it is in

599
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,319
the soil it is in compost and so you

600
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,319
know that because it canidates the

601
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,519
moment you drop it on a plate so

602
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,759
conidiation generally is a stress

603
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,158
response in fil fungi and it is oxygen

604
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,038
dependent okay light and oxygen makes

605
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,440
sense you're in the soil it's dark no

606
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,558
oxygen growing vegetatively but you come

607
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,159
to the surface that's when you want to

608
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,918
release your propagules you have light

609
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,760
you have oxygen and so in low oxygen

610
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
environments we get this induction of

611
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,200
these rugos colonies okay um you know

612
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,159
it's hard we don't have an incubator to

613
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,558
completely um Shield out light but you

614
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,440
can get these colonies that are

615
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,278
completely rugos producing very little

616
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,640
spores in response the low oxygen

617
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:35,480
environment and so the strain that we

618
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,240
evolved we ended up calling hm because

619
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,919
it resembled the low oxygen colonies of

620
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,240
the wild type strain but the reason we

621
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,600
gave it a specific name is the HM

622
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,759
colonies here's an example right here

623
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,480
they do this when oxygen is

624
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,720
present okay so they look like the low

625
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,880
oxygen colonies in the presence of oxy

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,079
okay and we we have a the quotation

627
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,840
there okay so we have an hmph so nmor

628
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,158
strains can switch between the two

629
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:08,079
different morphotypes but hmph are

630
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,440
locked into this rugos colon like

631
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,519
stat and so some other ways we've

632
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,360
Quantified this biofil morphotype

633
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,679
convince you that they're very

634
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,439
different the delay between my computer

635
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,440
and the zoom

636
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,158
screen there we go okay so if you want

637
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,558
to do genetics you need quantitative

638
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,880
data so one of the things we looked at

639
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,000
we can use confocal microscopy to set up

640
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
these submerged biofilm cultures the

641
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,038
nice thing about these cultures now is

642
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,000
we don't get asexual

643
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,640
reproduction okay which we don't see in

644
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,960
Vivo and these filaments they look a lot

645
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,440
more like that image Josh took from

646
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,079
theong so we've kind of really moved

647
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,278
heavily into using this model as a a way

648
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,079
to to study mold biology now in the

649
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,440
context of infection but quickly H morph

650
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,960
andm morph you should see some

651
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,480
difference how the Hy are orienting

652
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,600
themselves within the community and what

653
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,839
you're looking at over here is

654
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,918
quantification of the angle of departure

655
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:11,119
of each H within the biofilm from the

656
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,520
surface and so H more are growing more

657
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,558
horizontal and with the delay here I'm a

658
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,759
little worried these move oh okay good

659
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:17,759
we

660
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,919
go so the enmor biofilms you get this

661
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,919
really

662
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:31,158
distinctive sorry for the computer issu

663
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,080
not sure what's going on on but um these

664
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,120
really distinctive colony biofilms where

665
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,720
the hyy grow vertically so one of the

666
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,759
hypotheses we have in the lab right now

667
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,000
is that is actually aerotaxis and so

668
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,879
we're hoping to figure out what the

669
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,759
oxygen sensor is is it actually

670
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,240
aerotaxis or could the other Nutri

671
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,319
gradients that are forming that are

672
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,759
driving this as well but that's our

673
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,918
favorite hypothesis right now and then

674
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,519
if you look at the H morph colonies now

675
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,440
hopefully right away you can see there's

676
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,440
a lot more space between the

677
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,679
H and as this thing starts to

678
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,960
rotate hopefully you can start to see

679
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,000
that the H are growing they're longer

680
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,079
before they Branch they grow more

681
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,759
horizontally which helps create that

682
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:17,079
space and so the hypothesis here is

683
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,240
these strains now um are able to since

684
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:21,678
there's more mass diffusion capable

685
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,359
since you have more space between the Hy

686
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,320
the gradients that develop being are

687
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,918
less steep they have more access to

688
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,839
oxygen they have more access to other

689
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,559
nutrients and when you quantify

690
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:35,558
biomass in these strains these guys

691
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:38,200
always grow more they generate more

692
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:40,599
biom okay so I'm not going to go through

693
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,278
all the genetics um so you're probably

694
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,879
wondering what happened in the evolution

695
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,079
experiment so what happened is we found

696
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,080
a fungal specific Gene that was

697
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,839
unstudied in the subt Mir region of

698
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,720
chromosome 5 like my students worst

699
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,119
nightmare are you kidding me an unknown

700
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,319
unstudied Gene that's only in um the ASP

701
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,199
regillus genus and

702
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,798
so um it was but the good news was it

703
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,319
was clean it was a very clean experiment

704
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,679
there were three other Snips that were

705
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:13,278
high impact um after four months and um

706
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,038
this one was the one and so it has a

707
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,319
nuclear localization signal which I'm

708
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,319
going to show you in a minute it has

709
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,519
this one domain the secondary structure

710
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,678
is a beta Alpha Beta beta Alpha Beta

711
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:28,639
Motif which is a nucleic acid binding

712
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,880
domain it could be RNA it could be DNA

713
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,840
um and so it was in a gene cluster that

714
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,399
pops up here I heard AAL was here is

715
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,720
that right AAL yeah okay so we're

716
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:40,119
working with AAL on this now so it's in

717
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,919
this Gene cluster in the Subic region we

718
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,479
called it hack for hypoxia Associated

719
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,159
cluster this is seems to be a regulator

720
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,440
of the cluster because if we knock this

721
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,159
Gene out the other genes in the cluster

722
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,519
their expression turns

723
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,880
off um the AL itself that arose the AL

724
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,319
is both necessary and sufficient so we

725
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,760
can take the evolved Al put it into wild

726
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,000
type strains and we get this beautiful

727
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,398
rugos

728
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
morphology but you also can just take

729
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:12,038
the wild type O Leo which is silenced in

730
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,360
the wild type strain that we worked on

731
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,839
and overexpress it at an ectopic

732
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,599
location and get the beautiful

733
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,038
morphology itself so what happened with

734
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,199
the AL the alil actually increased the

735
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:27,720
expression levels of the transcription

736
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,480
of of what this Gene is and um we don't

737
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,200
know why could be transcript stability

738
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,880
um it could be increased translation

739
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,558
rate we we we don't we're not sure but

740
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,320
you increase the levels of this Gene

741
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,879
called hrma now um You induce expression

742
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,839
of all the genes in the cluster which is

743
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,278
great and it turns out there's another

744
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,158
Gene that we're working on with the meal

745
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,919
that was unannotated in the genome this

746
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,519
is a there's a lot of cool biology in

747
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,159
these fungal genomes don't necessarily

748
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,038
Believe The annotation you have if you

749
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,799
guys use fungidb like take your genome

750
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,240
sequence use seek load it up you'll find

751
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:03,240
all kinds of new genes that are not

752
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,640
annotated I find a new Gene every day in

753
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,038
our genome just that's I do for fun at

754
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,799
night I just scroll through I'm like oh

755
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,798
yep there's a new Jean right there

756
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,918
guarantee you will find new jeans and

757
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,519
some of them are really important so

758
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,000
here's a meal stuff that we're work we

759
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,720
just submitted this paper with an Neil

760
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,558
So it turns out that that Gene cluster

761
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,038
is on one of these giant Starship

762
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,960
elements and uh the paper here shows

763
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,599
that we found a lineage of asilis where

764
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
the cluster is moving um and so which is

765
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,240
really exciting we still don't know

766
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,120
where the genes come from um they

767
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,480
clearly are recently evolved within the

768
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,839
lineage they don't look like they're

769
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,960
bacterial um but you know sub there's a

770
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,480
lot of cool stories about subt Gene

771
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,919
expansion and parasites for example

772
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,960
malaria the reason you don't have a

773
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,919
malaria vaccine is because

774
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,120
subt um antigen variation it all occurs

775
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,960
in the subt region of malaria parasites

776
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:56,398
they just keep generating new antigenic

777
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,038
variants with these new genes so um

778
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,959
there's a cool can to the story from

779
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,398
running cormax group in canand Gada with

780
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,079
a subt region controled adherance to

781
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:09,038
surfaces a lot of cool stuff um a little

782
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,199
bit more about H RMA it goes around the

783
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,278
nucleus we think it's in the nucleis

784
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,319
we're still working on that you can see

785
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,079
the beautiful

786
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,720
localization it does have that signal

787
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,000
and then what we did is we knocked out

788
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,000
the nuclear localization signal protein

789
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,759
spine not showing you the Western blot U

790
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,159
but we we get rid of the colony

791
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,640
morphology if this protein cannot get to

792
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,039
that nucleolar or perinuclear

793
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
region all right so what's driving the

794
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,839
phenotype so the title of my my talk was

795
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,360
a little bit provocative cancer-like

796
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,199
metabolism so a couple things I told you

797
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,000
that

798
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,080
hmph occurs when Oxygen's

799
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,599
around and so one uh piece of data that

800
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,199
we got it was which was really

801
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,678
fascinating to us is that even though

802
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,720
ASP regillus is oblate arobe this is the

803
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,038
parent strain what we're looking at here

804
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,038
is the ability of a of a biofilm to

805
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:04,158
consume oxygen you can see very rapidly

806
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,519
asparagus consumes all the oxygen that's

807
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,559
available to it that's within the

808
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,319
biofilm so the fungus itself is inducing

809
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,119
a hypoxic micro environment in its

810
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,759
Colony it's just wild okay and then

811
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,599
here's our evolved 20 string which is

812
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,638
growing more it's producing more biomass

813
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,678
if you remember from that data but yet

814
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,599
it consumes less oxygen so there was a

815
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,720
disconnect there that's when we kind of

816
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,119
started thinking about cancer a little

817
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,600
bit um

818
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,278
one of the uh major challenges though

819
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,638
the difference between a cancer cell and

820
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,240
a fungal cell is all this Matrix and

821
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,678
this polysaccharide so fungi make this

822
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,679
huge cell wall we don't have cell walls

823
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,000
around our cells and fungi are

824
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,320
decreasing secreting this out into the

825
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,919
environment and so here's a temm image

826
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,519
of the parental strain you see that

827
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,200
beautiful cell wall here's Matrix on the

828
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,960
outside of the cell wall now but our H

829
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,440
morph strains you can see the cell wall

830
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,000
is different it's a lot thinner and then

831
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,919
the Matrix is balling up outside and so

832
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
it still produces the Matrix but it

833
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,480
secretes it

834
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,480
away from itself that may be important

835
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,720
in pathogenesis and we know it's

836
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,440
secreting it away because we can stain

837
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,000
for beta glucan which is what most of

838
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,278
this electron translucent layer

839
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,319
is we use a probe it's called dectin one

840
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,599
it is a pattern recognition receptor in

841
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,839
your immune system that detects fungal

842
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:34,319
beta gr so

843
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,199
um just like plants plants have pattern

844
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,759
R receptors they have you know Kit's a

845
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,038
great one in the plant fungal

846
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,038
pathogenesis literature this is the beta

847
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,519
glucan receptor in humans so we use it

848
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,359
as a tool we tag a Flor for to it and

849
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,638
then it binds beta glucan you can

850
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,079
quantify how much exposure you have a

851
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:55,439
beta glucan on your fungal cell so

852
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,439
consistent with that we have

853
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,839
that um and so when you have

854
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,519
more beta glucan exposed the immune

855
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,319
system is going to see it more and Hyper

856
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,638
react and so we actually think that

857
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,599
that's what's driving the increased

858
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:14,759
disease progression with these H morph

859
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:16,839
strain computer's really slow okay so

860
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,638
post damage so with these H morph

861
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,319
strains so this is an assay where you're

862
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,798
looking at tissue damage based on

863
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,278
release of an enzyme when sells lice in

864
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,638
your in in your tissue and so here's the

865
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,480
wild type strain this is an airway so

866
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:32,038
the funguses in the airway the parental

867
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,159
strain all that black is the aspil

868
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,278
scrolling as a bofilm and then the

869
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,600
purple those are neutrophils that are

870
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,519
coming trying to kill the fungus but

871
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,519
look at our H morph strain look at the

872
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,079
airway there's not you know the fungus

873
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,079
is spread out it's a whole another part

874
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,720
of the paper again the biop morphology

875
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,119
in Vivo and in vitro actually plays out

876
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,440
we don't get those tight I like we do in

877
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,079
the wild Tye they're actually all spread

878
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,038
out and then here look at these Airways

879
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,918
completely full nutr and so we think

880
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,720
that's being driven by the beta glucan

881
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,759
which is hyper inducing inflammation and

882
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,918
then you know the animals here basically

883
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:14,358
can't bre okay from these

884
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,960
strains okay so how is it doing that so

885
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:18,078
the the metabolic challenge here for

886
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,480
these organisms is to make this cell

887
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,879
wall and so what we've done recently is

888
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,599
a metabolomics experiment comparing H

889
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:28,799
morph to enmor fungal metabolism and we

890
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,720
got a surprise so in the hmor strains

891
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,519
anything in red is basically gone and so

892
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,719
what we're seeing here is an increase in

893
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:38,800
pentos phosphate pathway

894
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,158
intermediates and that's important

895
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,760
because that's where you get a lot of

896
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,720
nadph from and as I'm going to show you

897
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,960
in a minute to make a fungal cell wall

898
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,559
you need a lot of

899
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,559
nadph okay

900
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:55,078
and I showed you earlier when Oxygen's

901
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,039
low ASP regillus

902
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,480
permanent okay so what we think is

903
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:03,079
happening here the glucose is flying

904
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,599
through glycolysis to generate reducing

905
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,800
power as well as intermediates that are

906
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,440
needed to make the cell wall when oxygen

907
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,320
is limiting and so here's beta glucan

908
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,000
it's easy so the reason these hmph

909
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,400
strains have more beta glucan because

910
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,199
you can just take glucose 6 phosphate

911
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,960
and shunt it over to Beta glucan in a

912
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,159
couple steps you need a little bit of

913
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,079
nadph but that's it there's like one

914
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,759
enzyme here one here and one there it's

915
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,480
a really simple molecule to make

916
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,079
relatively speaking for a fungus the

917
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,719
tough one is kiten kitan is essential

918
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,039
for fungi it takes glutamine acetyl COA

919
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:41,039
a ton of NPH multiple steps including

920
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,400
the formation of UD glyc knac which is

921
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,559
important for epigenetic regulation all

922
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,400
other uh parts of fungal biology to make

923
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,400
this this is a ton of reducing

924
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,318
equivalents and carbon that are needed

925
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,318
to make a molecule of kiten very

926
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,000
expensive aspergilus makes galacto manin

927
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,679
which is part of the Matrix that it

928
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,318
secretes again multiple steps require an

929
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,399
NPH all coming off of fructose 6

930
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,920
phosphate so now you have a competition

931
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,519
to make kiten or galacto

932
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,920
manin and then the main polymer of the

933
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:18,440
Matrix is this molecule called gag which

934
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,880
requires UDP gnac from galnac from UDP

935
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,039
gnac so again really a lot of pressure

936
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,920
being placed on this molecule to form

937
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,838
this extracellular Matrix okay and so

938
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,680
how does organism do this well there's

939
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:33,719
plenty of oxygen there's no problem but

940
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,960
in these H morph strains where oxygen is

941
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:38,439
apparently limiting they found a way to

942
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,000
do that and so one of the cool things

943
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,720
that fungi apparently can do is they can

944
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,960
do reductive carox in the TCA cycle so

945
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:50,039
to run the TCA cycle in Reverse okay to

946
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,480
generate that reducing power that you

947
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:55,559
need to make that cell wall okay and so

948
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,199
when this happens Alpha ketoglutarate

949
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,639
gets carboxilate to isocit

950
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,399
okay and that gets converted to citrate

951
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,440
which goes out it can be converted to

952
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,160
acetal COA which you need for the kiten

953
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,159
biosythesis okay and the and the key

954
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,358
trick

955
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,318
here

956
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:14,480
yep um the key trick here that tipped us

957
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:16,519
off that this was a cancer-like

958
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,639
metabolism was this molecule right here

959
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,519
two

960
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,199
hydroxyglutarate it is produced in

961
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,119
cancer cells okay and we haven't seen it

962
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,000
before in fungi so what that molecule

963
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:30,160
told us is that in these hm strains the

964
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,440
TCA cycle is running in reverse and we

965
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,159
think it's running in Reverse to

966
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,318
generate NPH and the intermediates

967
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,318
needed to make a cell wall when oxygen

968
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:41,440
is limited it's a really cool mechanism

969
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:44,559
in order to maintain a structure that

970
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,519
you need to

971
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,000
survive um and the cool thing is you get

972
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,519
a ton of Ned Ned to keep glycolysis

973
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,800
going from that process too which is

974
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,159
absolutely essential so some of you may

975
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,000
have heard about this so this is the

976
00:37:54,159 --> 00:38:00,679
cancer model so the warberg effect was

977
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,960
discovered in 1924 by OT warberg it is

978
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:05,279
high rates of glycolysis in the presence

979
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,920
of oxygen for Mamon

980
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,319
cells the cool thing and you know how

981
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,880
this exactly Works people are still

982
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:13,880
working it's a huge area of cancer

983
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,240
research but it provides intermediates

984
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,680
to make lipids and nucleotides and Maman

985
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,479
cells but in the fungus we think it's

986
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:24,639
providing the intermediates to make the

987
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,199
cell wall and so these H morph strains

988
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:31,239
are having a warberg like metabolism

989
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,039
in response to an oxygen deficiency now

990
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,838
the question then becomes that is not

991
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,358
answered in the cancer field and we

992
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,599
don't have the answer either in fungi

993
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,880
but maybe we can get there why the cells

994
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,640
get locked in this physiological state

995
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,358
so we have the genetics and we're trying

996
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,519
to figure that out why do they stay this

997
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,960
way why don't they just flip back to

998
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,960
regular

999
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,519
metabolism so a little bit of support

1000
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,318
for that model if you actually take

1001
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,719
these H morph strains and you put them

1002
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:02,480
on uh media that you are forced to use

1003
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,318
respiration instead of glycolysis we

1004
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,679
completely can change the cell wall and

1005
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:10,960
we completely flip the morphology back

1006
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:10,960
to the wild type black Colony

1007
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,039
morphology just a check Lori when's the

1008
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,000
seminar end sorry one one perfect okay

1009
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,639
good all right um so you may be asking

1010
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,519
is this matter in Vivo well I showed you

1011
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,440
the H morph strain so G glycolytic

1012
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:29,039
intermediates this was Josh's white

1013
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,679
whale in his PhD we'd argue about this

1014
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,159
in my office so there's a there was a

1015
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,199
decent amount of literature saying that

1016
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,559
those

1017
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,399
respiratory carbon sources that drive

1018
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,480
respiration were probably the main

1019
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,079
carbon Source in Vivo for asilis so our

1020
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,800
whole model would kind of be a mess and

1021
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,880
not relevant to what's going on in the

1022
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,599
lung if that was the case Josh was

1023
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,800
convinced there was glycolytic

1024
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,599
intermediates available to the fungus

1025
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,760
within the lung and so before he left

1026
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,559
the lab he made this mutant called pfka

1027
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,520
phosphor fructose kinas

1028
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,199
you can see it can't grow on

1029
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,519
glucose okay but can't grow on La it

1030
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,598
grows a little bit on lactate you can't

1031
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,679
see it on the slide here grows fine on

1032
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,318
protein goes fine on acetate goes fine

1033
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,118
on glycerol so it's a great mutant to

1034
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,800
test his hypothesis and um you know he

1035
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,760
unfortunately came and joined Lor's lab

1036
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,720
before he was able to do this experiment

1037
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,359
but I can tell you the new PhD student

1038
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,679
was really excited because the pfk

1039
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:27,159
mutant cannot initiate

1040
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:28,960
infection so the the interpretation of

1041
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,399
this this experiment is that glycolytic

1042
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,000
intermediates are yes driving invivo

1043
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,358
fungal initiation of the infection so

1044
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,559
this glycolytic metabolism is essential

1045
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:42,119
for ASP regillus to progress disease so

1046
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:46,440
you'll get one more paper out of your

1047
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,039
PhD okay this isn't a lab artifact um

1048
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,920
these are different clinical isolates

1049
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,519
that we've recovered now from a bol

1050
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,838
malignancy patient patient with cystic

1051
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,519
fibrosis patient with pulmonary invasive

1052
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,639
aspidisca

1053
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,920
H morph morphology so this is coming out

1054
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,799
of patients and in fact if you go to the

1055
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,838
literature 1975 you can see the first

1056
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,318
example of this so again these are two

1057
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:12,119
different patients two isolates from the

1058
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:14,519
same patient one's H morph one's not we

1059
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,000
don't know because genome sequencing

1060
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,318
didn't exist back then if these are

1061
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,920
related but we have data now from

1062
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,480
patients at

1063
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,760
Dartmouth where

1064
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,039
we get isolates from the same patient

1065
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,280
here we go

1066
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,719
maybe there we go so these are all

1067
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,000
isolates from one patient different

1068
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,838
Colony morphologies this one is very H

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,358
morph like these are all related there's

1070
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:40,599
only a couple hundred Snips between

1071
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,598
these four

1072
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,559
colums okay so inv Vivo adapting this

1073
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,480
this H morph like physiology which again

1074
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,480
we think is because of the low oxygen

1075
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,920
environment found in the tissue this

1076
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,039
provides a way for the fungus to

1077
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,838
maintain

1078
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,920
viability to make it cell wall when it's

1079
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,799
missing I think here's 's about 12

1080
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,119
patients that we've looked at with

1081
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,920
cystic fibrosis that are infected with

1082
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,599
asilis and we see H morph isolates u in

1083
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,079
pink here in almost all the

1084
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,280
patients so these tend to be a rising

1085
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,480
inv Vivo in response to a low oxygen

1086
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,839
environment we're using this I mentioned

1087
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,719
to you guys early on you don't

1088
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,960
necessarily need to do a recombinant DNA

1089
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,000
based genetic screen we've taken these

1090
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,440
isolates so here's two from a patient

1091
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,519
with IPA they are only nine non

1092
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,358
synonymous high impact Snips different

1093
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,119
between these two this was a home run so

1094
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,440
this is my new students project and I

1095
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:38,880
think um Gillian will appreciate this

1096
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:43,679
one um the mutation is an

1097
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,318
Lea and so this the H morph strain has a

1098
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,799
loss of functional eel of L laa which is

1099
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,800
a methyl trans Ras Nancy Keller

1100
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,760
originally discovered many years ago

1101
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,960
that regulates secondary metabolism and

1102
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,640
fungal

1103
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,079
development and so here's the parent

1104
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,440
strain there's nothing wrong with the

1105
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,559
alil in the strain that evolved in the

1106
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,358
patient we lose this Lea uh there's a

1107
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,240
stop code on that causes a a premature

1108
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:12,318
stop and we can do all the necessary and

1109
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:14,318
sufficient alal swaps so here's the

1110
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,119
parental strain that we work with in the

1111
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:20,159
lab often here's our control strain our

1112
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,880
H morph strain here's the mutant of

1113
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,399
af293 from ny's Lab it's hmor which we

1114
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,318
went back and looked at her oh there it

1115
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,680
was it was in her paper um and then

1116
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:34,318
here's the Al from the patient that we

1117
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,919
put back into the mutant and it's

1118
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,480
non-functional and then if you take the

1119
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,440
clinical strain that has the loss of

1120
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,960
function Le and you put the wild type

1121
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,559
alil back in we can completely restore

1122
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,318
The Colony morphology so this is a good

1123
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,800
one because it gives us a genetic

1124
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:52,440
regulator we know something about for

1125
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,599
how so the idea here now that this is

1126
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,119
potentially an epigenetic regulator of

1127
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,079
that metabolic switch which is which

1128
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,920
which is cool because in cancer a lot of

1129
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,400
the regulation of the warb effect is

1130
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,838
done through epigenetic modifications

1131
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,760
and cells so early days on that but

1132
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,078
pretty

1133
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,880
cool so just to kind of finish up um i'

1134
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,240
I've showed you that these hmph strains

1135
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,760
are important in progressing disease

1136
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,719
it's not a lab artifact they're

1137
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,680
happening out in the clinic the cool

1138
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,399
thing is is that these hmph strains have

1139
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:25,598
this metabolic rewiring that's driving

1140
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,200
glycolysis and reductive carox we think

1141
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,000
the really drives cell all homeostasis

1142
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,199
and that in that context these strains

1143
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,400
become fit in low oxygen environments

1144
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,558
and then are able to cause disease and

1145
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,960
damage to the host and so

1146
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,880
um I think with that I will finish up I

1147
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,679
was going to show you the drug

1148
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:50,000
resistance stuff but we'll

1149
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,078
just skip the drug resistance stuff and

1150
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,358
stop

1151
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:58,039
there happy to take any

1152
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,960
questions students first

1153
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm curious if I'm understanding

1154
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,000
correctly wouldn't it make more sense I

1155
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,760
mean I know this is the case wouldn't it

1156
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,639
make more sense for the wild type that

1157
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,880
evolved in the higher oxygen environment

1158
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:18,239
to have um uh like Colony morphotype

1159
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,039
that creates the low oxygen environment

1160
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:24,358
to promote growth as opposed to the

1161
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:28,159
phenotype the one that involved in the

1162
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:31,960
low oxygen creating that

1163
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:35,920
so the wild typ string the one that has

1164
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:39,318
the the less clear cut nice looking

1165
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,639
morphol yeah so I think the answer is

1166
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:44,639
this I didn't show you is that those H

1167
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,118
morph strains are more sensitive to

1168
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:50,199
oxygen so I think in the wild type

1169
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,960
strain if you were to adopt that

1170
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:54,919
morphology as so some of the the the

1171
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,000
furing we see we think is a stress

1172
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,358
response to the oxygen that's a

1173
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,679
available in the

1174
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:02,159
environment and and so in the W the

1175
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:03,480
reason the wild type strains haven't

1176
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,799
been selected for this in the

1177
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,880
environment is because of that oxygen

1178
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,880
sensitivity that's our working

1179
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,079
hypothesis so like if you take hydrogen

1180
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,640
peroxide it just nukes these H Mor strs

1181
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,800
and so we think

1182
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,480
because as you reduce um electron

1183
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,039
transfer through the um electron

1184
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,480
transport chain you release a little bit

1185
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:26,920
of Ross and so these H morph strains do

1186
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,159
that far less we've measured that and so

1187
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,920
we think when you have more oxygen

1188
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,598
around when you ramp that up and those

1189
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,960
strains would become more susceptible

1190
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,359
and so you there' be so in the lab like

1191
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,960
a a 5% Fitness defect you you don't

1192
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,239
think about or care about but out in the

1193
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,159
environment that actually is a huge uh

1194
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:46,838
disadvantage so that's our hand wve my

1195
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,879
hand wavy answer cool

1196
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:52,519
thanks it's a nice like segue from that

1197
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,680
question do you see a difference either

1198
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:57,199
transcriptionally or genetically in

1199
00:46:54,679 --> 00:47:00,118
oxygen sensors so like loin like genes

1200
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,199
or anything between doing the HP yeah so

1201
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,280
good question so there is a globin like

1202
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:07,759
Gene in fungi it's called fungi

1203
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,319
globin um you know I haven't scooped too

1204
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,839
many times in my career but that was one

1205
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,639
time so we found so that Gene is

1206
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:17,358
regulated by the transcription factor

1207
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:18,799
that I um started you srba and so based

1208
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:20,279
on that data someone pulled it from our

1209
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,119
RNA seek and they published a really

1210
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,280
nice paper on it um but but it's really

1211
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,200
the function it's a globin it likely

1212
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,400
binds oxygen they didn't show that in

1213
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,558
the paper but in bacteria bacteria have

1214
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,639
a homologue and in bacteria it's been

1215
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,319
well studied as a molecule for grabbing

1216
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:37,519
oxygen and moving it across the

1217
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,000
different side of chromes in the

1218
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:42,400
bacteria cell membrane um so it's likely

1219
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,880
doing something like that in fungi but

1220
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,838
we didn't see any differences in that

1221
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,160
Gene transcriptionally in our between

1222
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:48,920
our hmph and

1223
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:52,719
NPH thank

1224
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,960
you um off of that also I'm curious um

1225
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,318
with the morphology of the hmph strin do

1226
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,760
you think that it's just like the

1227
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,358
horizontal growth is just a lack of

1228
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,760
clarity overall or is it like

1229
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,400
directionally

1230
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,640
horizontal that's a great question so U

1231
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,079
I have a postto lab is super interested

1232
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,719
now so I don't have an answer but he did

1233
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,160
his PhD in Rob aro's lab who self

1234
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:17,759
polarity uh lab and so he's super

1235
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:20,920
interested that very question great

1236
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,079
question it could also potentially be

1237
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,920
have to do with the um cell wall not

1238
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,480
being able to support vertical growth

1239
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,680
that's another model that we thought

1240
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,318
about that the cell wall is weaker um

1241
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,279
because they can't make as much kitan um

1242
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,519
as the the wild type strain so you can't

1243
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,720
get that vertical growth but the

1244
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:42,519
polarity question you're

1245
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,558
very when you're looking at your h mark

1246
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,039
stengths

1247
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:51,240
specifically do you see an incre

1248
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:53,639
production of other ve compounds like

1249
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:57,479
specifically yeah good question so if

1250
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:59,440
you look at our the RN

1251
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,639
oh yeah sorry um the question was is do

1252
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,480
we see changes in secondary metabolite

1253
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,440
production between hmph and nmor like

1254
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,400
with biotoxin and so with gleo toxin no

1255
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,880
but there are other secondary metabolism

1256
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,838
clusters that are differentially

1257
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,318
regulated between hmph and NM morph and

1258
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,400
definitely could be involved in the

1259
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:20,279
virulence um phenotype that inflammation

1260
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,318
could be involved in dictating how the

1261
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,319
colony organizing itself for for

1262
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:30,759
sure especially with the Lea result that

1263
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,760
we got recently in the clinical

1264
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:35,838
isol so as a clarification are the

1265
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,760
clinical isolat is it easier for the

1266
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:42,358
host to recognize it because there's no

1267
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,240
Matrix there yeah I mean e you know yes

1268
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,798
so definitely like you know both in

1269
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,479
vitro with macrophases and neutrophils

1270
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:50,679
like when they see the hmph strains the

1271
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,280
cell to activate rapidly you know

1272
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:56,759
through a decton one dependent mechanis

1273
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,359
um it turns out that didn't time of time

1274
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,359
one of my students the experiment to do

1275
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,318
was to take decton one knockout mice and

1276
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:06,480
see if that eliminated the virulence of

1277
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,039
the hmph strains because we thought it

1278
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,318
was all this nutrifil that were being

1279
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:13,599
recruited but um like plants humans have

1280
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:15,199
evolved many receptors for these fungi

1281
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,119
so when we got rid of detin one we

1282
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:18,679
really didn't see any change in the

1283
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,519
progression of disease or the

1284
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:22,199
inflammation but there are known there

1285
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,400
are other receptors of beta glucan

1286
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:26,399
within the system but the answer to your

1287
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,639
question is yes they definitely are re

1288
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,639
form

1289
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:34,039
what happens if you coinfect like your a

1290
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,759
great question so we've done those

1291
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:39,639
experiments in the lab and it's wild so

1292
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,839
you can take up to like 10 to one wild

1293
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:45,199
type to one cania of hmar and after

1294
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:47,400
three days the whole colon is

1295
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,838
H1 so we haven't done it in the mouse

1296
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,240
yet but we've done it in the lab we have

1297
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,759
I should have so that really cool you

1298
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:57,239
can do different H morph always wins in

1299
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,079
the lab condition

1300
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,078
have you ever done the reverse Evolution

1301
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,839
experiment where

1302
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:06,680
you and just repeat it in

1303
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:09,078
high yeah I bring it up quite often in

1304
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:12,679
lag no one's yet taking me taking me up

1305
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:15,839
on that one um so but it's

1306
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,879
um great

1307
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,318
question

1308
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:25,599
question

1309
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:27,798
have does it have what an yeah it does

1310
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,480
yeah I'm sorry had to skip through the

1311
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:32,798
the the the second part I mean I show

1312
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,798
you one piece of data here

1313
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:40,558
um drug data here it is so this this is

1314
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:42,440
um voriconazol and ampeter B these are

1315
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,960
the two antifungals we use in the clinic

1316
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,519
to treat aspergillus and so this is the

1317
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,480
viability and you can see the biofilms

1318
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,519
as they develop become completely

1319
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,798
resistant to those

1320
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,960
drugs and so there are mutations in the

1321
00:51:55,798 --> 00:52:00,798
targets that have been discovered there

1322
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,480
are mutations in the drug e flux pumps

1323
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:05,559
uh for the aols that have been

1324
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,519
discovered in clinical isolates and so

1325
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:09,319
it is a huge uh growing issue

1326
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,159
particularly with the agricultural use

1327
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:14,000
of aols out in the environment that we

1328
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,798
the story in the in the field is that

1329
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,239
that is selecting for these Target based

1330
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:20,239
and e-lux pump based

1331
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,440
mutations just a quick aside since um it

1332
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,079
was shocking to me that

1333
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,440
there hasn't been any cross talk between

1334
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,920
a antifungal development and human

1335
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,920
antifungal development those two haven't

1336
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,519
talked and so the story here it's a sad

1337
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,400
story so this the azol story is one

1338
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,280
that's emerging this is the drug but the

1339
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,480
second one is there was a new antifungal

1340
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,119
in phase three clinical trials it's

1341
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:51,000
called a Laur the dhodh inhibitor it

1342
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:53,358
looks great in the clinical trials and

1343
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,079
then out of the blue it turned out U

1344
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,119
Monsanto had already developed it as an

1345
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,200
a

1346
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,680
antifungal and they just released it

1347
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,239
last year for use in the fields and in

1348
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,358
the lab all it takes is like two

1349
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:10,358
passages on the Monsanto molecule to

1350
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,920
develop resistance in the Target Gene in

1351
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,920
aspergillis so it's a so what's going to

1352
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,079
happen to the human drug is very unclear

1353
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,559
now it actually failed it um it didn't

1354
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,680
fail the clinical trial but the FDA um

1355
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,920
didn't approve it um in part because

1356
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,558
they of the resistance this year so

1357
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,000
what's actually going to happen there

1358
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,960
we're not sure but it's a great molecule

1359
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,159
but so we need more cross talk between

1360
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,760
the two different groups to make sure

1361
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:37,639
we're not targeting the same mechanism

1362
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,200
um given how quickly these organisms

1363
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:40,199
develop

1364
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,199
AMR all right well thank you so

1365
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:55,239
much this has been a production of

1366
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:59,558
Cornell University on the web at

1367
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:59,558
