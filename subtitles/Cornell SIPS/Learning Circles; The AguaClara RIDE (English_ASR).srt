1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,480
okay so the title is i guess already

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,198
confusing learning circles and the hour

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,039
clutter ride so i'm an engineer so it

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
would be very easy to put me in a box

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,320
with nice square sides you know it's

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
made up of lines and it's also also very

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
tempting to think of

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,320
our education as linear

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,238
as a line you know you you start out as

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,238
a freshman you take some courses and you

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,759
build and eventually you graduate as a

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,359
senior and it's linear and so i i threw

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,878
the word circles up here to get you

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,960
thinking about how maybe it's more

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,558
complicated than that um and then the

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,640
hour clutter ride i should define the

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:51,839
abbreviation ride is research invent

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
design and power

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
i had a student give me this at

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
graduation last year and

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,198
it's

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
one of my favorite sayings has been that

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,599
it's a short walk to the edge of

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,438
knowledge she turned it around

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,679
and

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,679
i'm wondering how many of you noticed

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,159
that there's an interesting word inside

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,760
the word knowledge

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,719
now what'd you see

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,240
yeah

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,239
so what's funny is i

34
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,920
so you're a lot smarter than me i i had

35
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,559
been

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,118
talking about this phrase for for years

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
and had never made that connection and

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,159
then when

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
she created this little graphic and gave

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
it to me it's clear that those shoes are

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
about to walk off the edge and there it

42
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,118
is so anyway it's a short walk to the

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,560
edge of knowledge

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,040
and that's part of my philosophy and if

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,439
or something that i believe dearly and

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
my sense is if if you think it's not a

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,519
short walk to the edge or if you haven't

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,639
gotten to the edge you've not walked

49
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,798
very far

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
i think in any discipline you don't have

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
to go very far before you get to the

52
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,879
edge where there are things that you

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,438
don't know and i think

54
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,118
letting our students know that is really

55
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,959
important you know it's it's very

56
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,639
tempting to let our undergraduates think

57
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,239
that we know everything

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,359
and it's more fun to let them know that

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
we don't know everything

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,479
i've been doing aguaclada since

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
2004 2005 and so trying to figure out

62
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,598
how to talk about it is one of the

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
challenges because it's it's like

64
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,560
everything i do so i'm going to give you

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,280
three slices a perspective from honduras

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,360
a global perspective and then a cornell

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
perspective so in honduras the problem

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
that we're working on is there are there

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,560
are water supplies where honduras is

70
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,479
mountains okay everywhere mountains

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,159
everywhere and so almost anywhere where

72
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,840
there's a human settlement there's a

73
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,359
mountain that's higher and there are

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,598
streams up there and

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,840
the rainfall in honduras many places is

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,759
half decent and so there's often streams

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,120
that are running year round or springs

78
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,959
and so what they do is they go up in the

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
mountains they find a spring or a little

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,199
mountain stream or maybe even a river

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
depending on where they're at and they

82
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,439
take a pipe down to a distribution tank

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,080
and then onto the town and so you get

84
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,800
water out of your tap in your household

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
and

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,959
do you know about millennium development

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
goals

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
yeah okay so millennium development

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,039
goals one of them says that we should

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,039
reduce by half the fraction of people

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,039
that don't have access to

92
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,878
improved drinking water

93
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,878
and we just met that goal

94
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,280
okay naturally cool except that the word

95
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,799
was improved and this is improved

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
because it comes out of the tap in your

97
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,319
house even though even if it's river

98
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,439
water okay and our clotta is working on

99
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,359
solving that problem of having

100
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,840
dirty river water coming out of your tap

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,080
we think that's actually not safe we

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
know that's not safe

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
and even though i understand why it is

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
considered improved it's not the end

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
goal

106
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,759
so what we've done is we've developed

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
technology that would treat that water

108
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,039
and since 2005

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
our partner in honduras and

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,079
has built these plants

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
eight plants in seven locations

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
you you think i can't count it's okay

113
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,318
there's seven pictures up there um

114
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,000
here's what a plant looks like in a cad

115
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,199
drawing and

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,680
my little bragging here is this is

117
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,478
the result of

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,360
i don't know 10 000 hours of

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,519
of cornell undergraduate and a few

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,919
master of engineering students writing

121
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,839
code so that you can go onto our website

122
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,039
and request the design for a plant you

123
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,119
give it the flow rate that you want to

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
be able to treat and you get this cad

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,000
drawing and it's generated automatically

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
so technology that

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,199
i don't know of other places where

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,439
they're doing that kind of automated

129
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,960
parametric design that where everything

130
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,959
everything scales the way it needs to

131
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,039
scale to handle the flow rate this is

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,120
now the real thing looking inside one of

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
our plants a 12 liter per second plant

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,879
serving four villages

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,000
four poor

136
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,000
rural villages in

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
southern honduras

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,959
here's another picture of plants what we

139
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,280
do is we take very dirty surface water

140
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
and we turn it into clean water and we

141
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,599
do it all without electricity and it

142
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,680
seems amazingly simple and in a sense it

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,560
is very simple

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,400
and as part of doing this we've done an

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
awful lot of research in our labs to get

146
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,599
a better understanding at a very

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
fundamental level of what are these

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
processes what controls how well they

149
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,038
work and how do you make them

150
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
faster

151
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,800
and more cost effective and easier to

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,160
use from the operator's perspective

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,319
okay that was a slice of what's

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
happening in honduras and then let's go

155
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,038
to the global perspective so

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,038
here we are at cornell here we do

157
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,120
investigation innovation education and

158
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,120
design all of those things so our cloud

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,038
r d here at cornell

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,280
we are in the process of forming

161
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,478
aguaclada llc that is a business that

162
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,599
will

163
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,120
provide

164
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
the education sorry that will provide

165
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,478
the engineering services

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
for

167
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,399
the partners who end up building these

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,120
facilities and countries so

169
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,679
our cloud llc will work globally and

170
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
provide services to partners who work at

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
a in a country or maybe even in a region

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,399
in a country at building these

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
facilities

174
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
and then go down one step further there

175
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,159
are the organizations that actually

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,439
operate the facilities so it might be a

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
community elected water board that runs

178
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,839
the water treatment plant collects a

179
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,478
tariff

180
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,918
and makes sure that hires the operator

181
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,800
and then there's the people at the

182
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,758
bottom

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
the people that drink the water okay

184
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,400
this makes it look like this is all a

185
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
hierarchy

186
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,038
and i'm a little bit troubled by that so

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
let's mix it up so here we go um

188
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,038
so it's really like this they're

189
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,839
we're all there we're all interconnected

190
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,560
and we all talk to each other and

191
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,519
there's sharing of knowledge and

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
i

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,758
i get really excited about feedback

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,279
feedback is how you learn

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
we were talking about

196
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,279
are your kids an experiment right as

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,198
researchers when you have children are

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,879
they an experiment and

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
and either

200
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,639
you acknowledge that they are or you

201
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,239
pretend that they're not

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
because of course they're an experiment

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
right if you're a child

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,879
do you want to be experimented on by

205
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,439
your parents

206
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,360
what's your answer

207
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,719
no

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,439
or maybe yes and here's a pitch for yes

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,039
because if your parents don't admit that

210
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,560
they're experimenting on you it means

211
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,439
that they won't learn when they screw up

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,598
right

213
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,759
that's what feedback does you learn

214
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,240
based on your mistakes and so as you

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
know when i teach i i often admit to my

216
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,280
students that

217
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
they're guinea pigs in this situation

218
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,478
right i'm experimenting on them i'm

219
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
trying out educational techniques on

220
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,240
them and

221
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,439
i'm intending to learn from that to make

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,478
sure that i can do it better the next

223
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,399
time so

224
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,598
maybe being experimented on isn't such a

225
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,198
bad idea

226
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,959
within reason okay

227
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
okay feedback so i get really excited

228
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,318
about feedback feedback is one of the

229
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
reasons that agua cloud of plants in the

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,800
real world produce clean drinking water

231
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,319
and why many of the other technologies

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
that have been put forth

233
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
have not worked nearly as well and it's

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
because we use feedback we learn from

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
our mistakes and we make them better

236
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,478
every time and we'd look at what causes

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
systems to fail

238
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,120
and hence how do you eliminate those

239
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,719
failure modes the next time around and

240
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,160
i don't know this arrow could go in

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
either direction there's communication

242
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
that's happening

243
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,079
is it connecting like it means that

244
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,639
if a plant operator in honduras has

245
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,399
difficulty running a plant

246
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,319
there are mechanisms by which i will

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,080
hear about that

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,399
and that could turn into a research

249
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,759
project for my students to figure out

250
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,120
how to fix that problem so that it's

251
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,919
easier to operate or on another story

252
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
we were designing a new layout for our

253
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,958
water treatment plants

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,039
and we send

255
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,639
a cad drawing of this new layout to

256
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,679
honduras

257
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,439
to

258
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,199
our implementation partner

259
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
and the technician

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
at that organization not the engineer

261
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,639
but the technician looks at that drawing

262
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
and says ah but that's not going to work

263
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,720
because he gave me some reasons

264
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,479
and he was absolutely right

265
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,639
it would have worked but it would have

266
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
been unfortunate for the operator

267
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,080
so i got feedback and so we never ended

268
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,518
up making that mistake we never ended up

269
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
building that design because before it

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,039
was built we had feedback

271
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,518
okay so that was two slices that was

272
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,439
that was

273
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,639
what do we do first

274
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,320
we did honduras okay and then we did

275
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,278
like the big picture oh we didn't do

276
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,879
this part so all these guys so

277
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,559
there's one of these there's one of

278
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,559
these well okay there's a couple of

279
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,278
these right cornell's around the world

280
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,599
but really there's there's one in ithaca

281
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,039
sorry geneva right okay

282
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
and then

283
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,039
there are implementation partners so

284
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,360
there's one partner in honduras now and

285
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,480
we're spinning up another partner in

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
india

287
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
and there's

288
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
it'll eventually happen in other

289
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,359
countries as well so there will

290
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,879
ultimately be many implementation

291
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
partners around the planet that are

292
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,720
building our cloud of plants

293
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,320
and then each of them will be working

294
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
with multiple water boards and each of

295
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,278
them will be working with many customers

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
okay so it just

297
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,799
i guess it's a big pyramid scheme but

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,800
hopefully in a benevolent sense

299
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,759
okay so now at cornell

300
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,278
so

301
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,879
this is now getting closer to the

302
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,838
nitty-gritty of the program and this is

303
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,399
where you can start thinking about how

304
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
might you generalize this

305
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,039
oh my goodness okay so there's research

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,958
and event design and power

307
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,439
how do i want to talk about this

308
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,319
oh my goodness okay so a freshman coming

309
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,800
in can take my introductory course it's

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,278
an intro to engineering course and right

311
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,120
off we mix things up because in that

312
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,639
class i call it a design class a

313
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
freshman design class does that make any

314
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,639
sense

315
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,879
how can they design when they're

316
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,799
freshmen right like our pedagogy says

317
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,399
you have to wait until your seniors to

318
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,319
do design work at least in engineering

319
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
that's what we think of it so anyway i

320
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
call it design

321
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,959
and they actually

322
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,399
design and build a lab scale water

323
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,039
treatment plant that is computer

324
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,879
controlled and that produces clean water

325
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,759
and they have sensors to verify that it

326
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,278
meets

327
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,240
us drinking water standards when it's

328
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,639
done

329
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
they do that in small teams

330
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,639
and and i know that they don't

331
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,560
understand everything that is all the

332
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,919
theory behind it but i give them a taste

333
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,958
of that of the different theories so

334
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,559
they have a little bit of a sense of

335
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,159
what's going on enough

336
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,559
that it makes sense to them by the time

337
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,559
it's done

338
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,838
so this is doing things completely out

339
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,879
of order

340
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
and i think it's really important

341
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,039
because

342
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,159
then

343
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,159
later on when they take a theory class

344
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,319
they've already seen it and they know

345
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,679
i'm not pulling their leg about how

346
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
things work because they've seen how

347
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,199
this worked and they know what was

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
important in making the system work

349
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,360
and then the theory makes more sense

350
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,200
i'm this is the circles like um fluid

351
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
mechanics is one second

352
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
fluid mechanics is one of the hard

353
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
courses in in engineering curriculum and

354
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,000
i've always said you should really take

355
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
the course twice

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
because the second time around there are

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
things that are taught at the beginning

358
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
of the course which will now make sense

359
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
to you that didn't make sense because

360
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,599
you went down a line and the stuff in

361
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,720
the beginning you just couldn't figure

362
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
out how to wrap your head around it but

363
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
after you learned the stuff at the end

364
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,359
you come back and it makes sense and i

365
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
think all of us who have gone through

366
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,399
multiple levels of courses there we've

367
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,679
experienced that where things that

368
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
didn't make sense now beginning to make

369
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
sense yes

370
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
this is a three credit course this is a

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
three credit actually everything three

372
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,759
credit okay

373
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,439
so

374
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,799
freshmen do this

375
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
juniors or seniors can do this i

376
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,719
actually had a sophomore do this once

377
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,638
and she did great

378
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
all out of sequence

379
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,159
okay then

380
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,599
over here is the project

381
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,439
so this is where students are working on

382
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,240
the project they're doing

383
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,399
research or design work doing research

384
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,360
in the lab and there are graduate

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,480
students

386
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,919
there are

387
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,879
project courses that are for

388
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,240
freshmen and sophomores who have not yet

389
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,159
taken

390
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,200
or juniors who have not yet taken this

391
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,919
course

392
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
and then there's a senior level course

393
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,078
that is for

394
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,199
people who've already taken this theory

395
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,199
class

396
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,959
they're in the same project but now they

397
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
can get design credit for working in the

398
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,239
project whereas these folks

399
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
they don't actually get any credit

400
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,159
that's worth anything

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,919
okay sorry they know that

402
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,078
and then there are master of engineering

403
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,360
students who are taking the course or

404
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,120
the project for their design project

405
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
but what i do is i

406
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,159
i wrap a circle around that whole thing

407
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,159
and students from those three entryways

408
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,439
into that course all come to the same

409
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,838
room

410
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,560
we all meet together and then we split

411
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,800
them up into teams and we split them up

412
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,559
into teams very carefully actually and i

413
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,319
don't do this i delegate this to my team

414
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,198
leaders they figure this out they split

415
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,879
them up into teams and there are

416
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,879
mixes of

417
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,399
student abilities mixes of ages of

418
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,720
students or

419
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,159
location in their degree program

420
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,519
all mixed together

421
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,519
to create these small teams

422
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,278
okay there's also a summer internship at

423
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,679
cornell we have this great program

424
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,078
it's no money no credit come work for us

425
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,799
and what's amazing is

426
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,519
is that students do this we we have like

427
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,519
20 students come and work every summer

428
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,879
as part of this so it's amazing what you

429
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
can make cornell students do

430
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,599
sorry but i know that half of you are

431
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,599
cornell students so

432
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,879
okay and then there's an engineering and

433
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
context course where i take about 20

434
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,879
students to honduras for two weeks

435
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,720
during the january inter session

436
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,399
this currently there's no credit for

437
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
this and it's not officially connected

438
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
with any courses it's just something

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
cool to do and

440
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,039
i see it as an integral part of the

441
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
program

442
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,000
i have one here

443
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,320
i pointed to this

444
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,759
time in honduras as learning and i've

445
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,920
pointed to this stuff as service just to

446
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,600
reverse things for you because in the

447
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,000
service learning model you tend to think

448
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,759
of what you do on campus as a learning

449
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,278
time and what you do

450
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,198
at the project site as as service

451
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,120
and i actually think in in this case

452
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,599
it's more reversed they're doing the

453
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
useful things that will help our folks

454
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,519
our partners they're doing the useful

455
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
things here at cornell

456
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
and then when they're in honduras

457
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,879
they're mostly learning

458
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,278
okay anybody want to ask a question

459
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,278
about this

460
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
oh one more thing

461
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
don't tell my director

462
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,720
wait

463
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,839
can i trust this many people

464
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,440
but i i give two lectures per semester

465
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
in this course

466
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,680
that's not per week that's two per

467
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,759
semester um and

468
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,838
uh

469
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,399
it's it's team time it's time to work in

470
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,839
i think it's time for some pictures

471
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,000
no it's time to go

472
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
alt tab

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
will this work yes okay so this is a the

474
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,879
wiki for

475
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,560
that project course and

476
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,919
we divide up into teams so i didn't want

477
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,479
to make another powerpoint slide so i

478
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,198
was lazy so here's all these topics that

479
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,120
are currently being researched and each

480
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,919
of those would link to another wiki page

481
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,039
where

482
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,559
they'll describe what they're doing and

483
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,639
they'll be posting their their reports

484
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,000
as they as they work during the semester

485
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,879
and there's a little blurb about each of

486
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
them which you could read on forever

487
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,958
so the point is that's what's happening

488
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,879
in that course students have a design

489
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,239
challenge or a challenge that they're

490
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,639
working on a research challenge or a

491
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
design challenge and they're working on

492
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,680
that for the duration of the semester

493
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
and they're

494
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,879
they're writing

495
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,039
reports every couple weeks

496
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,240
and we're evaluating them

497
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,879
and who evaluates them okay so here's a

498
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,799
teams of three to five i said some of

499
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,078
this before

500
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,679
range from developing new theories

501
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,679
optimizing performance developing new

502
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,958
fabrication methods creating design

503
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,159
algorithms all those things are

504
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,319
happening

505
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,838
all under this overarching create safe

506
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,759
drinking water

507
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,318
the leadership structure okay so i'm

508
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,078
director of the program and

509
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,240
i describe this as servant leadership so

510
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,959
my job is to provide the resources so

511
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,279
that the team members can be successful

512
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,078
so that's there there are undergraduate

513
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,199
graduates and faculty who work together

514
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,399
to provide feedback to individual teams

515
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,318
i have

516
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
undergraduates who actually read some of

517
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,319
the reports and evaluate them and give

518
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
them back i have

519
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,359
a graduate student who's doing some of

520
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,160
that and i'm doing some of that we share

521
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,159
the load between us

522
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,639
i have student leaders who organize the

523
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,038
training sessions for the tools that are

524
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
used there are there are research tools

525
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
that we've created over the years that

526
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
make it possible to automate

527
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,319
the operation of experiments and it's

528
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
one of the ways that make it pop makes

529
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,119
it possible for

530
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,359
students who

531
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,959
can't spend 40 hours a week in the lab

532
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,038
to actually do meaningful research they

533
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,319
can automate their experiments and so

534
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,440
they have to learn how to use that

535
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,960
automation system and so my

536
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
students

537
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,160
create the tutorials

538
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
to train the new students coming in how

539
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,279
to use that system

540
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,519
and i don't do any of this

541
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,000
my students do this

542
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,519
my i have a student leader she creates a

543
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,359
syllabus

544
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,879
and says what's happening on each day

545
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,199
during the semester

546
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
and she tells me what to do she says

547
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
you're giving your tip your talk on this

548
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
day

549
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
and that's an undergraduate by the way

550
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,319
and she's been she's been great she's

551
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,960
been doing for the last two years

552
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,480
and then the graduate students

553
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
have a completely different experience

554
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,038
too i tend to have about two graduate

555
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,119
students

556
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,599
only two for this program and

557
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,479
they end up having this experience of

558
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,319
basically being a pro managing a program

559
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,160
so they get to do what faculty normally

560
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,200
do normally faculty run a research

561
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
program

562
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
my graduate students

563
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
effectively run a research program where

564
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,279
they have multiple students working

565
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,319
under them

566
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,240
under them

567
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,678
in a servant leadership kind of way

568
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,679
working on different research projects

569
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,519
symposium so in the middle of the

570
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,639
semester we have this symposium system

571
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,918
where

572
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,679
we used to do

573
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
powerpoint presentations and we all sit

574
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,559
there and watch them and we realized

575
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
after a while that that wasn't the most

576
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,000
effective way to learn about what each

577
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
of the teams was doing so the point of

578
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,240
this symposium is that you want an

579
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
opportunity for all of the teams

580
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,200
to figure out what all the other teams

581
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,798
are doing so there's sharing of

582
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
knowledge between teams because they're

583
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,000
doing very different kinds of things

584
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,600
each team is a very different kind of

585
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
research

586
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,599
so they give short presentations

587
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
right next to their experimental

588
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,038
apparatus so they can actually point to

589
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,079
it and explain how it works demonstrate

590
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:44,879
it

591
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,960
and

592
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
they do it in relatively small groups

593
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,000
and we end up spending

594
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,839
four

595
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,919
class periods for 75-minute class

596
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,439
periods to rotate all the teams through

597
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,400
all the stations so that everybody gets

598
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,080
to

599
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,080
tell everyone else what's going on and

600
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,079
also gets to see all the other

601
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,599
teams that are doing their thing

602
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,279
so that's another example of peer-based

603
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,359
learning

604
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,678
this is now going to honduras so some

605
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,759
pictures from honduras uh

606
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,440
students getting to see the hour cloud

607
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,720
of plants getting getting the talk

608
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
interview the

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,839
the operator find out what works what

610
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
doesn't work what kind of problems

611
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:23,279
they've tended to have

612
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,279
and just fully engage

613
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,480
and another thing that we do

614
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,480
so this is where

615
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
the learning and service are really

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
closely tied together so this is a

617
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,919
filtration system that

618
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,839
students had developed over the previous

619
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,120
semester and

620
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,918
now they're

621
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,079
attempting to deploy it in honduras

622
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,600
and the goal of this is it's not going

623
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:51,519
to be used yet it's in the it's

624
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,199
oh no and it's it's going to be

625
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,119
it's like this is like a first

626
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
deployment let's try it and see what

627
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,599
happens

628
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
and

629
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,839
why do we do it it's so our partner in

630
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,000
honduras can see what technologies are

631
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,319
that we're working on

632
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,079
and it'll get their ideas spinning about

633
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,519
well where might this kind of technology

634
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,599
actually make sense

635
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,158
in their context and they'll give

636
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,439
feedback to us and and given that this

637
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,679
was the first time we deployed this

638
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,720
filter it also had problems

639
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,798
and so we get feedback about what failed

640
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,558
and that goes back to our lab to fix the

641
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:29,038
next semester so that was one example

642
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,279
we also get to look at our plants and we

643
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,798
get to see how they how they work

644
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,279
so this is looking at a sedimentation

645
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,440
tank and they're taking it apart and our

646
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,440
students are getting to see how this

647
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,840
really looks

648
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,320
they had opportunities to see pictures

649
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,879
and to see autocad drawings you know in

650
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,639
previous semesters but they all comment

651
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
that there's nothing like

652
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
actually seeing the real thing and

653
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,360
seeing how it all fits together

654
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,399
okay this is now

655
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
the world that many of us live in where

656
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,919
there's there are these three spheres

657
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,720
there's research

658
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,240
there's teaching and there's service

659
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,440
and

660
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,798
marshall made it clear that apparently

661
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
i'm doing something that is a little bit

662
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,918
uncommon it i hadn't fully realized this

663
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,038
but this is what i did i took them

664
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,640
and i sucked them all together and

665
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,759
and i think i confused my director

666
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
sometimes

667
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,400
because

668
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,519
he's like is that research or is that

669
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,519
teaching and i'm like yes

670
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,038
actually it's a

671
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,079
it's a real like there's accounting

672
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,839
issues

673
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
i don't know there are accounting issues

674
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,678
that drive them crazy because like what

675
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,759
was that researcher teaching

676
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,120
like well how would i know i mean it was

677
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,079
research that's part of a course so

678
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,319
what's that okay so there it is

679
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,000
community scale drinking water is is

680
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,399
what i'm working on and what has been my

681
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
focus for the last eight years

682
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,080
and

683
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,919
all of it fits underneath that

684
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,918
so a few reflections it's hands-on

685
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,520
learning it's mixing up application in

686
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,840
theory

687
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,599
so many of our students are incredibly

688
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,599
highly motivated to do something to make

689
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,678
the world a better place and if you can

690
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,879
tie tap into that

691
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,120
you've got a really powerful connection

692
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,640
you can you can make them work hard not

693
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,558
make them you can invite them to work

694
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,159
hard and they will deliver

695
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,158
they provide an amazing volunteer

696
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,919
workforce

697
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,880
yeah

698
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,880
so does it work

699
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
so four papers per year published in

700
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,720
decent journals

701
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,440
over the last two years that are

702
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,519
research results coming out of this

703
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
lots of students engaged in

704
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,038
20 students in the summer 35 students in

705
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,519
the fall

706
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,679
this is in the in the project courses

707
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,558
and 55 students in the spring

708
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
many inventions were open source which

709
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,000
makes it open source is so efficient

710
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,360
because when you invent something you

711
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
just throw it on the web and you're done

712
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,599
you don't have to do anything you don't

713
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
have to talk to

714
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,038
the c-tech you just throw it on the web

715
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,439
and nobody else can patent it and

716
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,839
anybody can use it and you're done

717
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,200
i i think that labs that are so tied

718
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,279
into making sure that nobody else can

719
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
use it they end up wasting a lot of time

720
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,279
making sure that happens

721
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,279
this is simple

722
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,720
our students write their reports and

723
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,319
when they rewrite their reports every

724
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,200
two weeks those are immediately posted

725
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,879
on the web so stuff that they're

726
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
developing during the semester is

727
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,919
protected from

728
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
somebody trying to patent it right away

729
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,558
so okay we have many inventions we have

730
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,679
a new theory for flocculation you don't

731
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,879
want to know about flocculation but

732
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,559
anyway we have a new theory for that

733
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,919
that's that will eventually hit the

734
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,720
press it's going to take a little work

735
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,919
to debunk old theories there's 30 000

736
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,319
people with safe drinking water in

737
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,440
honduras there's an hour clouded llc

738
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,558
spinoff

739
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,320
and

740
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,399
i think we have an incredibly cost

741
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,720
effective research model in that we can

742
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,080
generate lots of results with a few

743
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,519
graduate students

744
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,158
and on

745
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,158
a tight budget

746
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:03,400
this has been a production of cornell

747
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,399
