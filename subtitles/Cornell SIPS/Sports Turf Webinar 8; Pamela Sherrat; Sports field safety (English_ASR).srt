we FaceTime FaceTime me when he first

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,570

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,719
ventilator for 15 days and I told Carl

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,939
it's about hope yeah you just hope so

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,370
and we're so glad that you are giving us

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,250
play-by-play activities of your back

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,340
yard it looks like they were actively

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,939
reading the pool instructions while you

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,939
were lamenting the the trampoline

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,739
killing the grass and Brian wanker

29
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,560
confirmed that yes the trampoline will

30
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:25,289
in fact kill the grass and then Kobe

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,460
schmuck erupt you guys went all in on

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,210
the trampolines 5 hammocks 5 hammocks

33
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:35,969
hillbilly social distancing maintaining

34
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,280
a sense of humor Pam is really very

35
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,200
important during these times and and

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,950
really to help the grounds folks the

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,170
sports folks along these lines EST ma

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,719
has just done a spectacular job in

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,210
providing resources one of these that we

40
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,250
talked about last week is is one I'll

41
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,319
highlight there's a couple more that

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,349
we'll get to as we go on let's do a

43
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,329
quick recap of the weather before we get

44
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,769
out to a conversation about sports turf

45
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,950
management for those of us in the

46
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:08,189
Northeast you can see we remain well

47
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,579
behind normal now this is going to

48
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,949
change dramatically over the next week

49
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:17,790
but with the warp will come copious

50
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:20,068
amounts of rainfall for us in the north

51
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,169
our tea guy tano our climate specialist

52
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,689
at the Northeast Climate Center was

53
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:28,109
talking to us about a rain event that

54
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,270
proceeds a tropical storm and so that's

55
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,099
what we're going to be experiencing he's

56
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,069
not as worried about the tropical storm

57
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,189
but it could be large swaths of anywhere

58
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:40,259
from two to three to four inches

59
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,169
throughout the northeastern US so while

60
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,449
the temperatures will begin to warm and

61
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:48,719
we will start to see some change to this

62
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:51,509
they're really not going to be much more

63
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,000
than normal and so we'll remain behind

64
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,459
the amount of degree days will

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,349
accumulate base 50 degree days you know

66
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,670
indicating the amount of time above

67
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:05,909
average temperature is above 50 degrees

68
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:08,579
you will see some improvement but a not

69
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:11,639
not a huge dramatic shift there will be

70
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,209
some temperatures in the 80s expected

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,189
now if you started to plan your things

72
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,680
at the end of March and early April in

73
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:22,289
the Northeast you saw back in April that

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
soil temperatures were already creeping

75
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:28,530
into the low to mid 50s

76
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,659
a month later again it looked like it

77
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,049
was surging on it didn't hadn't moved

78
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,139
that much and and as of recently we

79
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,000
still aren't very much further ahead

80
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,518
we're slow to come along here now of

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,829
course where Pam is out in Ohio it's

82
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,329
much further ahead certainly down in

83
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,609
southern Ohio Scott to be a little bit

84
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,319
further ahead than we are up here but

85
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,859
you can see soil temperatures are really

86
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:55,369
not driving things now to me one of the

87
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,989
fascinating things about this is is that

88
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,459
there needs to be let me see that I get

89
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,989
this in the right place yeah I got this

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,939
in the right place there we go

91
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,639
Pam did a wonderful job with the team

92
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,459
there how state the Ohio sports turf

93
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,469
Managers Association right away out of

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,719
the gate because of course the growing

95
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,209
season is enhanced you know further

96
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,399
ahead than it is here right away you got

97
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,459
these top ten maintenance practices to

98
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,009
focus on particularly as we were

99
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,310
confronting maybe not being able to

100
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,860
access the field now more recently the

101
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,769
SP ma is of course responded to this and

102
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,538
a recent

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,219
publication came out healing through

104
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,589
sports I thought this was really good

105
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,810
sort of compiling things and our

106
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,269
colleague feminized colleague Grady

107
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,089
Miller at NC State was asked this

108
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:46,478
question because apparently there were

109
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:48,969
people in a sports turf world who all of

110
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,918
a sudden couldn't access their fields

111
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,470
now of course this is a bermudagrass

112
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:56,168
field but the question to Grady that Pam

113
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,659
is also a columnist in the sports turf

114
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,549
magazine answering questions as well the

115
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:03,668
question is what do I do if I can't get

116
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,680
there for months well you know I put

117
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:08,469
just a simple answer up here because

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,189
what bermudagrass yeah it's not great

119
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:15,280
it's probably going to take a few weeks

120
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,038
to get it back but if you get it at the

121
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,198
right time when bermudagrass

122
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,259
can can sort of rejuvenate and grow

123
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:28,180
after a scalping you're likely in good

124
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:31,449
stead but cool season turf abandoned to

125
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,150
some degree like this even sports fields

126
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:36,098
you see the fields starting to grow now

127
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,429
in the southern part of the state you

128
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:41,168
can see the infield skin beginning to

129
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,560
get weedy when you're not allowed access

130
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:46,689
to the field obviously recovering these

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,750
things are gonna take enormous amounts

132
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:51,579
of labour and care and of course one of

133
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,560
the things everybody's gonna tell you is

134
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:56,500
you know if your fields went into this

135
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,598
pretty good hopefully with just some

136
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,098
minimal maintenance they'll come out of

137
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,319
it pretty good and that's been pretty a

138
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:04,269
pretty consistent message that we've

139
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,710
seen but Pam you wrote this really great

140
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:10,418
article recently about thresholds for

141
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:12,399
acceptable we cover we talked about this

142
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:14,918
a little bit last week with sera Caen

143
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,138
but what I think this highlights to me

144
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,990
are a couple of tools I want to talk to

145
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,060
you about with regard to this idea of

146
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,889
you know going out looking at your

147
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,550
fields getting a sense of how they

148
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,620
perform and using tools to communicate

149
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,668
that to the people that we work with so

150
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,689
here's the SDM a Excel spreadsheets

151
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:40,418
playing condition index here is your

152
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,788
report card for rating athletic fields

153
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:43,219
you know trying to quantify sort of how

154
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,680
we

155
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,230
two things and here's our really simple

156
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,209
sports turf rating system that we have

157
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,370
on our sports turf site now I'm not

158
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,529
partial to any one of these I think you

159
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,990
know sitting down at a conference or

160
00:06:54,529 --> 00:07:00,500
listening to this and saying okay well I

161
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,990
can see how to use this tool and really

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,379
I have to say Pam this is the question I

163
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,129
have for us to chat about today is is

164
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,180
live

165
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:17,930
I've been alarmed at the amount of

166
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:19,879
people that are struggling with just

167
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,160
being able to do essential maintenance

168
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,129
they're not able to add to justify even

169
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,710
accessing their fields so are you seeing

170
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:31,069
much of this and let's start there

171
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,229
are you seeing much field abandonment

172
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:37,939
people not realizing what they have to

173
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:39,439
do I'm seeing at all different levels so

174
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,769
I have a friend who manages a

175
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,209
professional baseball field and he

176
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:48,379
doesn't have any fungicide and there's

177
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:50,329
been a lock on buying anything so that's

178
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,519
his problem and then I have you know

179
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:55,129
local school district and local park and

180
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,979
rec facilities the grass is six eight

181
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:01,219
inches tall in field starting to get

182
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,860
weedy my local school districts have

183
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,570
noticed they have come out in a mode to

184
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,449
keep it to try and keep it somewhat

185
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,909
manageable but yeah I think there'll be

186
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:13,099
it's at all levels all levels and at all

187
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,650
different types of sports and is it

188
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,800
related does it have anything to do with

189
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:22,250
us not being able to talk to people

190
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,810
about what we need to do or is it they

191
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,939
just shut it down and they didn't want

192
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,600
to hear from anybody I think it's

193
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:32,479
probably the last the last mainly budget

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,229
freezes hiring freezes interns let go

195
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,750
those decisions were made very quickly

196
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,879
by administration without the input I

197
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,408
think from a lot of field managers so I

198
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,240
think I think with it just been an

199
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:48,169
unprecedented time those decisions were

200
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,799
made really quick and and as we begin to

201
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:53,809
reopen up do you see a role for going

202
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,069
out and assessing the field I mean some

203
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,769
people are gonna say listen we're not

204
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,220
playing sports where we got

205
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:02,649
we'll get to it in the fall how can we

206
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,410
you think these tools will be useful in

207
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:08,860
helping people communicate the things we

208
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:11,709
have to do up the line yeah I think we

209
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,590
have to I think we have to concentrate

210
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,150
on the on the the big three you know we

211
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,370
have to say look we've got a we've got

212
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,759
to do married we've got a mo we're going

213
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,379
to control weeds and then depending on

214
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,980
your situation it might be disease

215
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,840
control or insect control or irrigation

216
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,210
or fertilizer whatever it is for your

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,980
particular instance but I think you need

218
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,680
to rather than try and do everything

219
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,730
just concentrate on the one or two or

220
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,979
three of the basics and this has been

221
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,670
what you've developed to guide these

222
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,710
decisions now is it your sense that guys

223
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:52,289
have been able to do these things so

224
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:55,120
you're saying there's a range obviously

225
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,549
losing ground on Bermuda grass at this

226
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,310
time of the year might be able to be

227
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:04,049
made up what about the cool season guys

228
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,009
that are coming back to six-inch turf

229
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,439
well I think we're trying to get the

230
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:12,159
message across that you know mowing

231
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,050
mowing is a stress so because we know so

232
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,360
much we have to do that other things you

233
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:19,329
know irrigation fertilizer pest control

234
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,129
if we're not mowing we don't have it's

235
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,590
not under as much stress we can also

236
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:26,139
back off those other practices so I

237
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,060
think just just having a mowing plan and

238
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:32,740
being able to communicate that mowing

239
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:34,119
plan will be key you know it's the cool

240
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,310
season grass isn't going to die if it

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,779
gets to be eight inches tall you've just

242
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:40,449
got to have a really good plan to bring

243
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,980
it back to your original height so

244
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,430
whether that you know using rotary

245
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,930
mowers maybe even taking clippings off

246
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:50,259
so that you don't have you know tons of

247
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:51,759
clippings on the field house maybe work

248
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,919
with some volunteers try and help me

249
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,200
mowed more frequently because I don't

250
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,139
see unless we've got sports on these

251
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,460
fields I don't see the staff levels

252
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,919
coming back up and that's another issue

253
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,379
is manpower there just isn't the people

254
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,049
to do the mowing because then they've

255
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,939
cut seasonal staff yeah the seasonal

256
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,389
staff is where the loss is going to get

257
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,000
hit

258
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:15,578
as an aside I know you're active in the

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,828
scouts and I know that STM a did this

260
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:20,979
really nice thing with Scouts I know

261
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:23,469
that Nichole with the Orioles is doing

262
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,920
some sense temps up you know this is

263
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,379
happening to try to connect the youth to

264
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,629
this industry do you see this as a

265
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,769
really opportune time it seems like

266
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,179
you're you know you're doing it at home

267
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,940
with the kids you're doing it with the

268
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,328
Scouts is this a really opportune time

269
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,990
when our staffing levels are low to to

270
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:45,370
use that time to get people involved you

271
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,549
know communities have sports

272
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,700
associations is there a way to use them

273
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:53,259
to help get back and do things safely if

274
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,300
we don't have the staff what are you

275
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,149
what are you seeing about the connection

276
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:01,750
between this brewing enthusiasm around

277
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:03,549
this as an you know a stem area of study

278
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,220
and the potential for it to help us

279
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:08,409
moving forward I think it's been a

280
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,870
wake-up call for us all in academia that

281
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,240
our student levels are down in the

282
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,100
industry and we're trying to look all

283
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,990
different ways all innovative ways that

284
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,449
we can connect with youth whether it's

285
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:24,190
to Scouts or stem videos or going into

286
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:26,500
schools or go a event yeah 4-h I mean

287
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,089
it's all there I love what Nicole's

288
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,419
doing I've sent a lot of people doing

289
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:33,130
the same kinds of things they just don't

290
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,360
know we exist we just have to keep

291
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,490
getting the message out there that this

292
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,800
is an industry that exists and I'm

293
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,778
teaching a plant science merit badge to

294
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,019
a hundred Scouts right now across the

295
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:46,028
nation clock every night this week will

296
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,589
come on and we zoom and there's a

297
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:49,419
there's a section in the plant science

298
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,790
book about careers they have to they

299
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:53,669
have to look at plant science careers to

300
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:56,799
scrap turf grass isn't even mentioned

301
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:00,189
I'm shocked I'm shocked there's a plant

302
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:03,490
science merit badge it's such a you know

303
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,529
the fact I mean I years ago here at

304
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,629
Cornell we used to have to do marketing

305
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:10,629
just to teach kids what plant science

306
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:13,409
was that you could actually study plants

307
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:17,350
and never mind at the specialized level

308
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:19,389
we're at now that's a it seems so

309
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,190
obvious a lot of us work at schools

310
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,620
right it's been a wake up for academia

311
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,250
but but at the same time students in

312
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,769
high school

313
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,379
fools you know getting them involved

314
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:32,500
that at that age is going to help build

315
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:35,169
this later on but but we have to

316
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,169
reconcile that with as soon as times get

317
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:42,099
tight at various places unless you're at

318
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:44,229
the highest level it's a very different

319
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,060
industry there's only one per I mean how

320
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,920
many people at these facilities right

321
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,799
what's happening at the you what's

322
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,809
happened at the you where you are at the

323
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,859
Ohio State what's happening to the

324
00:13:52,809 --> 00:14:00,429
sports fields they're um they're being

325
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,279
maintained still so Brian gimble and the

326
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:05,759
crew were staggering times coming in

327
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,579
they'd still be maintained and they've

328
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,769
synthetic and natural yeah we've got

329
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:17,520
synthetic in the stadium we put it in

330
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:22,870
there since 2007 I believe baseball

331
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:26,079
basketball synthetic and rugby synthetic

332
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:31,899
so there's a lot of synthetic turf all

333
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:34,240
infield yes yes and so he's not is he so

334
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,639
one of the things that happens is the

335
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,299
municipalities to school districts the

336
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,529
lower level things have fewer resources

337
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:44,079
but really that's where a lot of the

338
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,860
jobs are I feel like we're having a hard

339
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,200
time getting those people to value the

340
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,480
professionalism and I see in your report

341
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,070
card one of the questions you ask is do

342
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
you have a certified sports field

343
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,830
manager and I just think that isn't

344
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,899
prominent enough in our industry to

345
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,050
demonstrate the professionalism you need

346
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:07,838
to manage these fields at a high level I

347
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:09,699
agree and I think it comes down to the

348
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
type of people who are in the industry

349
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,350
are typically hard-working humble people

350
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,289
that don't like to you know talk to

351
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,550
their own horn whatever you want to say

352
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:22,029
but we've got to do it you've got to put

353
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:24,009
a suit on look smart talk to people you

354
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:27,669
know when we went to the Women's Forum

355
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,200
STM a years ago we we looked at the lady

356
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:31,629
who wrote there she was the CEO of

357
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,730
Facebook and we we were given a copy of

358
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,129
her book each and she says sit at the

359
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,629
table if you're invited to a meeting sit

360
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:39,879
at the table

361
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:41,439
and I keep telling sports to have

362
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,090
managers this if you're invited to them

363
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,130
that meeting you go in that room and you

364
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,399
sit at the table you don't sit on the

365
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:50,289
edge and keep quiet you have a voice you

366
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,840
know sit at the table that's that that's

367
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:56,139
the message have you found that these

368
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,230
field assessment tools help bridge that

369
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,399
gap

370
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,580
I worked solutely data is power

371
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,279
absolutely

372
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,770
data is power if you can go and you can

373
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,519
say look we've gone from 30% we'd cover

374
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:13,740
to 80% we'd cover this this during this

375
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,620
pandemic we have to do something with it

376
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,840
numbers tell the entire story dangerous

377
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,000
power and we talked about that last week

378
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,860
with sera Caen as weed populations

379
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,990
increase the traffic tolerance is not

380
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,940
going to be good now you know I know you

381
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,549
mentioned in your article about micro

382
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,830
clover right this is gonna be a buzz you

383
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,169
know people buzz I keep saying it it's a

384
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,290
funny pun but we don't want covert on

385
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:39,449
sports fields I think the issue with it

386
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,459
is the big issue and I was listening to

387
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,110
Paige Boyles webinar last night and I

388
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,490
know she's on tomorrow one of the

389
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,870
challenges where there is that you can't

390
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,330
control where the weeds if you've got

391
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,029
micro clover in you and you mix how do

392
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,530
we you know that needs addressing the

393
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:56,490
we're teller on Soviet the mowing

394
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:58,139
quality of it I think a 10% probably it

395
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,060
wouldn't you know what percentage is a

396
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,080
good percentage and how do we control of

397
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,909
the weeds those are some of the

398
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,220
challenges with it well and you know

399
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:08,069
clovers not one that plays nice it

400
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,620
starts out sort of interspersed and then

401
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,828
it gets clumpy and and one of the things

402
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,899
we've talked about consistently in these

403
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:18,149
webinars with chase and when everybody

404
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,610
else is you know when an athlete plants

405
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,560
their foot if one spot is markedly

406
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,208
different from another spot they're

407
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,609
either if they don't sense it there's a

408
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,009
higher likelihood for injury in those in

409
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:31,169
those situations so anything that gets

410
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:33,230
clumpy and weeds are one of those things

411
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,480
that maybe not might not be as obvious

412
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,360
could then lead to problems with safety

413
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,099
so let me transition to safety I've been

414
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,919
pounding on it we've had a number of

415
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,559
people talking about it but gosh Pam no

416
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,019
one's got a clay it seems like no one's

417
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,480
taking this data at the various levels

418
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,339
what do you think is one of the ways

419
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,860
we're going to be able to have some

420
00:17:53,339 --> 00:18:00,480
success in getting these fields looked

421
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:03,839
at as an aspect of school or player

422
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,309
safety it will probably come through

423
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:11,159
some kind of legislation or being forced

424
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,049
to do it I think usually this it doesn't

425
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,560
it doesn't happen

426
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,779
we have to do it you know in Columbus

427
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,240
Public Schools we've got 17 high schools

428
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,069
and so that's a lot of schools to get

429
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,900
tested that's a lot of you know that's a

430
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,700
lot of equipment they just don't have

431
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,890
the money the only budget item they have

432
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,720
um that only line-item they have for

433
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,960
sports turf management at our district

434
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,190
he's mowing that's it nothing else just

435
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,019
knowing so how do we get the message

436
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,670
across and it's important I think he'll

437
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,619
come through legislation someone get

438
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:46,550
injured and it'll be something we have

439
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:49,369
to do to keep these safe has that led to

440
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:52,009
the preponderance of more synthetic turf

441
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:54,589
in your mind the idea that I need more

442
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:56,150
people in it somehow if I get synthetic

443
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:58,519
turf I don't have to you know quote its

444
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,990
no maintenance sort of thing and you

445
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,629
know I mean as professionals you know

446
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,329
I'm speaking as devil advocate but I

447
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,310
wonder if that's not the logic that they

448
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:09,859
use to get synthetic turf as well I just

449
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,779
need less guys absolutely they don't

450
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,879
have to worry about it we put it in we

451
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,319
don't have to stress about it where we

452
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,300
don't you don't need to maintain it it's

453
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,359
just gonna it's something we can we can

454
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,950
build and walk away from and everybody

455
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,579
can sleep at night that's that's their

456
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,400
that's the misconception and it wouldn't

457
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:31,220
so you know when you talk about 17 high

458
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,080
schools in Columbus Ohio and I know what

459
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,839
they feel about football and sports in

460
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,149
Columbus Ohio the fact that all they

461
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,099
budget for is mowing they must have a

462
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,740
fair amount of synthetic fields on those

463
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:44,569
on those campuses yes no they don't no

464
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,370
because they have to all be treated the

465
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:52,869
same so if they install one they have to

466
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:55,969
install sick people what what is the

467
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:58,219
well that's that you know and and every

468
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,589
time that's a huge capital expense and

469
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,660
that's been the argument for the you

470
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:05,029
know the long term investment you make

471
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,690
in a natural grass field now I'm an

472
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:11,839
advocate of having a synthetic field to

473
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,400
flex to when the weather's bad when when

474
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,589
you know the lacrosse team wants to get

475
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,600
out there and it's snowing particularly

476
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:20,629
in our neck of the woods I like it as a

477
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,819
flex field but not as a routine field

478
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,530
but if you put a lot of traffic on

479
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:27,169
sports turf even sand bass fields Pam

480
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:30,149
practice fields are gonna get worn out

481
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,560
yeah yeah they do I mean there's a

482
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,870
certain level of wear that you can put

483
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,579
on them but for me the balance is you

484
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:38,250
know as a sports to have person but also

485
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,559
as a parent I don't want my kid played

486
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,309
on something that's 150 degrees in June

487
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,899
July and August I don't I don't want my

488
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,629
kid breathing in whatever is coming up

489
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,000
those the chrome rubber and you know the

490
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,530
science is not the EPA is released

491
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,339
whatever they released and the science

492
00:20:52,529 --> 00:21:01,379
isn't there but as a parent I have those

493
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:02,669
concerns and they get hard there there

494
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,500
is maintenance to them they're not

495
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:08,070
maintenance free and over the long haul

496
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,140
are they economic economically sound for

497
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,819
you know if my local high school puts it

498
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,759
in and it costs them over a million and

499
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,960
the only lasts eight years you know

500
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,190
they're good you need to start looking

501
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,620
at the numbers a little bit more than

502
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,750
they do I think well I think it's partly

503
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,019
because of what we're experiencing that

504
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,539
somehow natural grass has challenges

505
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:29,789
that are alleviated by getting the

506
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,019
synthetic turf and you bring up an

507
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,839
interesting point and you know you

508
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,000
wonder as the role you sit in both as a

509
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,000
parent and as a leader in the in the

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,240
sports turf world do how would you like

511
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,700
to be approached by sports turf managers

512
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,829
as a parent do you do you think even

513
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,900
parents notice the quality of some of

514
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:51,990
these fields their kids play on or just

515
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,370
like okay go play leave me alone I don't

516
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,690
think they notice it I don't think they

517
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:59,189
see it they don't notice it they don't I

518
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,400
mean I stand on the sidelines and I

519
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,170
grumble about quino fields my kids play

520
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,300
on it's 100 percent prostrate not weed

521
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:11,130
so by October it's completely brown and

522
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,710
they're playing on bare dirt to not wait

523
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,750
and brown not weed and it's just not a

524
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,769
consideration until I say something and

525
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:22,170
then they're like oh oh yeah like they

526
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:25,379
they don't see it alright Carl we got

527
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,730
some questions yeah there's a good one

528
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,140
from Brian here and it touches on a

529
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,360
couple things we've already talked about

530
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,460
he's actually a baseball coach high

531
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,199
school in Illinois and he said the

532
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,730
maintenance people who cut the fields

533
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,350
there are really more of a general

534
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,059
maintenance person he says they're

535
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,449
electricians out of mechanics by trade

536
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,309
and

537
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,200
coming out of the winter it looked like

538
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,669
they went from dad about seven inches of

539
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,019
Kentucky bluegrass and they just kind of

540
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,019
scalped it right down to an inch and a

541
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,849
half it was white and so now he's got a

542
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:53,099
situation where you know maybe it's just

543
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,629
coming back he's wondering what kind of

544
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,689
suggestions you guys would have and then

545
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,850
maybe another question is how should he

546
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,860
go about talking maybe to administration

547
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:04,109
or the maintenance people about the

548
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:05,729
importance of managing a turf field and

549
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,369
the stuff we talked about today be a

550
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,829
safety I'm gonna give that one to you

551
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:13,799
Pam I mean I think seven inches down to

552
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:15,809
three inches that grass lost a lot of

553
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,230
its leaf and what happened was the one

554
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:23,039
in a half well and what happens is when

555
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,880
you allow grass to grow it fins you get

556
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,039
fewer larger plants the plants just

557
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,250
respond difference in density goes down

558
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,500
in fact instead of going up as you lower

559
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,950
the mowing I density will go back up so

560
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,740
you're gonna see a lot of just thin turf

561
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:44,759
for a while and that of course is ripe

562
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,009
in Illinois for weeds I think I'll pass

563
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,519
at the fam about a talk about safety of

564
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:52,740
something like that and I've come across

565
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,450
this scenario before I work with a

566
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,839
volunteer group that would come in once

567
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,090
a week and mow it up an inch and a half

568
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:02,159
so it's you know it's not just about the

569
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:04,349
agronomy here it's how does how do you

570
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,110
relay that message in a kind way to the

571
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:11,939
ground staff you have to just educate

572
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:14,759
them in a kind way in an open way you

573
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,170
know just try and educate them on the

574
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,059
mowing height that it should be and how

575
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,769
we get there and the one third rule and

576
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,609
the fact that keep hammering that

577
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:26,039
message home that mowing is a stress

578
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:28,469
it's a stress and if we stress it too

579
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:31,470
much which they've done they need to

580
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:34,140
leave it alone don't Berta cut your

581
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,059
dairy don't spray anything just just

582
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,970
leave it alone

583
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,409
you may feed it a little maybe make sure

584
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,890
it's irrigated if you're going to a hot

585
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,110
dry period now in Illinois you'll be

586
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,090
we're getting really warm in Ohio now so

587
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:51,000
it's gonna be 80s I think by this

588
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:53,279
weekend if you've got an irrigation

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,210
system irrigated spoonful

590
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,240
leave it alone yeah especially because I

591
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,710
don't think oh we're playing baseball

592
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,200
maybe we're gonna start playing baseball

593
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,660
soon I haven't I know that I know Golf

594
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,549
is gearing up to get going but I haven't

595
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,259
heard anything beyond that is there

596
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,349
another question Carl before we start

597
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,690
wrapping up no more questions and maybe

598
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:17,669
I'll just ask one along those lines you

599
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,460
know Frank and I know you and I have

600
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,950
experienced this situations where the

601
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,170
coach and the managers in fields maybe

602
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,750
sometimes butt heads and we've kind of

603
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,029
discussed this on you know past webinars

604
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,990
but Pam are there any techniques that

605
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:35,670
you can give a turf manager to try and

606
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,059
defuse maybe those some of those

607
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,170
situations where a coach comes in and

608
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:41,669
you know maybe tries to tell them how to

609
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,440
manage the field and they feel

610
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,230
differently what's a good way to

611
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,850
approach that with with coaches and

612
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:52,230
managers chief managers it's an art form

613
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:54,359
unasyn seminars that you can go to about

614
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,730
this managing conflict while you've got

615
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,669
if you've got some time I'm only hands I

616
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,519
would recommend all sports Ted managers

617
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:04,310
look into you know leadership doing some

618
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,079
lead getting some leadership skills

619
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:10,819
managing conflict about listening you

620
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,819
know you listen more than you speak

621
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,929
my experience is those people don't know

622
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:21,140
what they don't know yeah yeah a lot of

623
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:22,669
times a coach will come in and and we

624
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,490
have talked about this and this is

625
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:27,080
really it was informative to me Pam we

626
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,140
were dealing with some soccer coaches

627
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,538
here and we tried to get feedback one

628
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,929
coach would be very detailed about the

629
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:38,119
kinds of aspects of the game that they

630
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:41,960
felt the turf was involved in and the

631
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:44,119
way the ball behaved and and was very

632
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,308
clear about well I don't like this I

633
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,048
want that so you know rolling and

634
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:50,028
watering and table you know the things

635
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:51,740
we know we can do to manipulate that

636
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:53,599
surface and then there was another coach

637
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,120
who said you know you got a moat lower

638
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,129
and and puts an topdressing and then

639
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,209
it'll be fine and so one guy was telling

640
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,620
me what they wanted and other guys

641
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:05,298
telling me what to do I have to sort of

642
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:07,219
I'm from New York everything sounds

643
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:09,288
sweeter when you say a Pam it doesn't

644
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,038
sound so sweet as hard as I try still

645
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:16,278
sound like what are you a dope so so so

646
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,808
I eat it's hard sometimes to deal with

647
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:19,398
these things and I think the most

648
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:22,970
important thing you said is you gotta

649
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:26,509
like okay this person just needs to be

650
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:29,058
massaged to understand there's many ways

651
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:31,519
to skin this cat and and not only it is

652
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:33,408
an art form to community it's an art

653
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,750
form to provide the conditions these

654
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,789
people want sometimes never mind field

655
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,919
hockey on natural grass I don't know how

656
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:42,288
much you run into that but that gets to

657
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,470
be enormous ly difficult because you've

658
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:47,119
got to cut the grass so low yeah yeah

659
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,190
most field hockey fields I see at the

660
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,538
REC level here in Ohio are all for annua

661
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,798
to those reason no it is an art form and

662
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,890
you've got to be the expert in the room

663
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,339
and data data data data everything you

664
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,740
say

665
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:02,538
backing up with data you'd be the expert

666
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,759
in the room but there's not you know

667
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:07,429
that's that's back to the safety day

668
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,408
yeah how many guys have data on their

669
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,390
hands on a pretty regular basis

670
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:14,000
maybe they got labor and or they have

671
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,759
their budgetary things right but but but

672
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,960
the assessment of those field ought to

673
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:24,579
be routine and I hear at even moderate

674
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,880
levels it's not yeah

675
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:29,678
not necessarily doing a condition survey

676
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,528
report like you'd have to do for a

677
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,630
building you know that simple data that

678
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:37,028
there are tools you can use we I just

679
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,130
listed three of them here you can make

680
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:41,079
one up on your own if it helps you

681
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,390
communicate what you're trying to do

682
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,158
because I think that's the way we're

683
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,759
gonna get these fields back when sports

684
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:53,710
return when they return yeah I agree I

685
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:55,119
agree and I used to take my students to

686
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,730
visit a field manager who I really

687
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,319
respect and he said also find out when

688
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,849
the money's coming from because if you

689
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,319
can find out their money's coming from

690
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:04,538
and you know how much you're bringing

691
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,668
into that pot you can get a little bit

692
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:08,769
of that money so it's not just about

693
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:10,990
agronomic data it's about you know find

694
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:12,788
out where the money's coming from find

695
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:16,048
out how much of that you contribute and

696
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:19,450

697
