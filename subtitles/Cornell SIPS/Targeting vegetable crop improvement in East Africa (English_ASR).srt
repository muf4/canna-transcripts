1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,679
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,879
University so I basically want to talk a

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
little bit about some of the work we've

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,199
been doing in Africa over the last few

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:20,079
years I think it's um both interesting

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,760
and offers a lot of um opportunity to

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:27,079
move forward on a lot of levels

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,359
um it really started off when um Charles

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,960
Wonga who many of you um made know in

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,280
this department joined my program in

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,920
2006 Charles is uh from Western Kenya

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,280
but came here on the Cornell

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,520
assistantship for horiculture in Africa

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,600
and this assistantship really involved a

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,879
lot of the research work actually being

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,719
done in the home country in the case of

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:56,039
Charles in Kenya or East

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,920
Africa so Africa is a is a different

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,679
place for many people some people think

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,000
it more of a kind of a safari

21
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,159
type of land where you may go on

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,920
vacation um or maybe a lot more rural

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,320
but in actual fact it's um it's a

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,640
continent that's going through changes

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:20,758
uh quickly and on many many different

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,799
levels um it it's probably changing in

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,359
many respects as much as any other part

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,000
in the world at this point in time if

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,920
you go back maybe 10 15 years uh it it

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,599
was very difficult to even uh

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,320
communicate amongst groups the Advent of

32
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,399
the cell phone has really taken over and

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,478
almost bypassed the whole kind of

34
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,840
central telephone

35
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,438
grid and now what you're seeing in The

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Last 5 Years is really pretty

37
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:53,039
astonishing the amount of road building

38
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,559
that's going on particularly driven by

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,880
the Chinese and particularly in um more

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,320
of the Interior areas of the country

41
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,519
like Western Kenya in Western

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,919
Ethiopia when I started going out there

43
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,118
in 2008 some of the roads in Western

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Kenya were appalling and it could take a

45
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,239
couple of hours just to get maybe 20

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,159
miles now they have um brand new roads

47
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,920
developed by the Chinese and you can do

48
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:21,039
that in maybe a fraction of the time

49
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,559
maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes so a lot

50
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,878
is going on in Africa on a lot of levels

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,080
a lot is changing with populations uh

52
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,280
where people are

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,200
living um and just the movements of

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,280
people in

55
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,119
general if you look at the traditional

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,199
African

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,000
diet um it's predominated by corn which

58
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,318
you see pretty much everywhere and it's

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,280
served as a kind of a ground corn that

60
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,560
is called

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,199
ugari then this is typically served with

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,878
um some type of protein whether it's

63
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,878
Lake tilapia which is common around Lake

64
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,919
Victoria um or chicken goat for in

65
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,158
instance and if meat isn't available

66
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,199
then dry

67
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:09,280
beans but if you look beyond the Staples

68
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,719
of the carbohydrate and the protein the

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
next most common side dish that you see

70
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,000
from a vegetable standpoint are leafy

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,759
greens a lot of them are not the leafy

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,799
greens that we might expect or consume

73
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:25,639
here um the leaves of cow peas are

74
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,799
commonly consumed um the leaves of sweet

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,158
potatoes or even common Bean so there's

76
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,799
a whole different range of leafy greens

77
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,598
that are typically served in the African

78
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,200
diet

79
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:43,119
the availability of crops is also

80
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,079
changing um you can go to some

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,080
marketplaces now and you see crops that

82
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,719
you would never have seen 10 or 20 years

83
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,680
ago um in particular green beans or snap

84
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,158
beans as you can see

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,000
here uh in this case in the market

86
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,840
you're even seeing the availability of

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,639
broccoli even though it's very poor

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,039
quality um in amongst the more Staples

89
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,958
of things like um tomatoes and

90
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,639
carrots and the other thing that's

91
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,039
really being driven over the last 10 or

92
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,519
20 years um largely through the changes

93
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,319
in urbanization is the appearance of

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,319
supermarkets supermarkets popping up all

95
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,719
over the place where population centers

96
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,040
um are starting to

97
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,800
gather um in areas like Kenya you're not

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,759
having a population increase that's

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,759
pretty high over time uh but very

100
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,038
noticeable in the cities Nairobi for

101
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,720
example has doubled in the last 20 years

102
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,879
from 1.8 million to about 3.6 million or

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
higher

104
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,478
today so along with the supermarkets

105
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,478
you're starting to see uh a much bigger

106
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,159
diversity of vegetable crops in

107
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,918
particular um that's helping to

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,000
diversify and Advance the

109
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:03,038
diet so if you start looking at how some

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,519
of these farms are in this

111
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:09,680
area um they're typically very small

112
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:13,000
often times less than an acre there's

113
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,439
almost no mechanization on most of the

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,399
farms and they're typically predominated

115
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,918
by crops like corn and dry beans where

116
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,839
they may have a few plants say coffee

117
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,839
plants or some sukuma Wiki plants um or

118
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,359
perhaps a couple of

119
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:32,918
bananas um so this is

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,879
a farm that we uh were visiting at the

121
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,359
early part of Charles's project as we

122
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,038
were basically going out to speak to

123
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
people about some of the crops that were

124
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,800
grown some of the opportunities that

125
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,399
might exist uh for growers in this

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,600
area so we actually met up with um

127
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,079
people on a number of levels uh people

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,160
who are involved with government

129
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:59,240
institutions universities International

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Institutions and also Outreach and um

131
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Farm

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,240
uh in this case we were visiting uh

133
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,038
farmer Nia MSO in Western Kenya uh with

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,439
Dalma seunga who's a faculty member at

135
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,959
um MSO

136
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,800
University and then we had uh this guy

137
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,120
who's involved with Outreach and a

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
couple of Growers who in this case are

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,478
starting to look at snap beans as an

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,280
alternative crop for

141
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,879
production and you can get into

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,638
discussion with a number of The Growers

143
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,279
in this area this is one of the growers

144
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,199
in the MSO area here and they they're

145
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,918
very eager to find New Market

146
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,360
opportunities and way that they can

147
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,758
diversify the crops that they are grown

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,598
they know how to grow a lot of the

149
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,280
bagged staple crops like corn and beans

150
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,199
but they want to be able to move one

151
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,079
step further they want some Enterprise

152
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,079
opportunities some opportunities where

153
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,159
they can grow on some of their areas of

154
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,159
land some crops of higher

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,080
value and this is where um horiculture

156
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,919
and particular vegetables really start

157
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,878
to come into play

158
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:06,918
Africa is not the easiest of places to

159
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,800
get around it is becoming easier um

160
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,120
there's often times difficulty to get a

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,639
vehicle for all of the people and if you

162
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
have a vehicle that's not four-wheel

163
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,800
drive you can run into issues like this

164
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,639
especially when you're in farming areas

165
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,879
this is Charles actually testing the

166
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,918
depth of the water so we can get this

167
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,919
car through the

168
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,439
puddle so we went out to Kenya and

169
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:35,120
Tanzania in 20 2008 and we met um a

170
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,160
number of groups institutions and

171
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Growers while deciding how we were going

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
to focus the efforts or we where we

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,360
could actually have some impact when

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,840
we're looking at East Africa from a

175
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,080
standpoint of Upstate New York of course

176
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,758
um in this case we're visiting the

177
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,680
snapbean production areas which are up

178
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,598
Northwest of

179
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,598
Nairobi um and this is Charles speaking

180
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,878
to a grower but we're also traveling

181
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:06,800
with uh the bean breeder from K Thea um

182
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,039
and these guys that are involved with um

183
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,079
irrigation and Outreach as some of these

184
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:15,240
crops are being set up in these

185
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,279
areas so snap

186
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,879
beans really came to the Forefront one

187
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,079
because we already work on snap beans

188
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,840
here in Upstate New York and the other

189
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,198
reason is that they're currently the

190
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:32,399
major Horticultural export crop for East

191
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,399
AA Africa at least the major single crop

192
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,799
if you take the whole floral industry as

193
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,360
a whole it would be

194
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:42,799
higher um but snap beans um grow very

195
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:48,399
very well in the Highland areas of East

196
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:50,079
Africa around um Lake Victoria and

197
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,480
they're really grown based on an

198
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,560
Enterprise basis for feeding into the

199
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,120
Western European

200
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:02,399
markets which may seem counterintuitive

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,078
why people uh growing crops in Africa to

202
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,120
export to high-end markets in um Western

203
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,239
Europe well there's a lot of benefits

204
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,039
that actually come back from this whole

205
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,159
Arrangement the first one is that snap

206
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,159
beans um have to be of a high enough

207
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,078
quality to be E Rated out of the country

208
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,639
so when a lot of these snap beans are

209
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:26,199
actually produced only about 30% of the

210
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,159
ones that are harvested actually make it

211
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,519
to Europe the other 70% of them start to

212
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,919
make it into domestic markets and this

213
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
is where you start to see people consume

214
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,599
green beans you start to see them in

215
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,879
local markets you start to see them in

216
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,240
supermarkets and then they actually get

217
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,559
adopted into um and as part of the

218
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,440
different

219
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,439
diets um the other reason is an economic

220
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,000
opportunity for The Growers snap beans

221
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,279
because they're um harvested as a fresh

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,919
market crop they have a lot more weight

223
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,240
than a dry bean would have so if a

224
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,759
grower is getting 20 Kenya shillin for a

225
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,440
kilograms of dry beans he could be

226
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,559
getting the same price for a kilogram of

227
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,720
snap beans but you can be harvesting

228
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,679
five times as many snap beans from the

229
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,639
same acreage as dry beans so you now

230
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,278
give the opportunity for Growers to

231
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,958
produce a crop that they're familiar

232
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,639
with common Bean but give them access to

233
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:25,639
a fresh market um

234
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:29,319
Enterprise which gives them um a lot of

235
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:32,078
opportunity to start um to earn cap

236
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,879
Capital um as part of their

237
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,838
operations and it it's had a surprising

238
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,480
effect in the area I mean I I speak to

239
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,279
Charles and we talk about the snapbean

240
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,278
areas in Kenya and he talks about how

241
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,600
you drive into these areas and you just

242
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,679
as you drive into them you see

243
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,480
noticeable increases in affluence of the

244
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,319
people who are actually living in the

245
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
areas where they produce snap beans so

246
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,800
it has become a very important crop and

247
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,839
it's even just on a government level and

248
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:01,479
the carry institutes they are very keen

249
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,480
to try and promote the production of

250
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,120
these as much as

251
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,399
possible they um they are grown on small

252
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,959
farms as you can see here this is a

253
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,759
small farm Northeast of

254
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:17,919
Nairobi um they're also grown at very

255
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,439
high altitude the reason for this is

256
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,399
that they're very sensitive to high

257
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,040
temperatures so a lot of the areas

258
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,958
around Lake Victoria are High Plains

259
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,159
agriculture areas people don't really

260
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:36,278
think of places like Uganda and Kenya as

261
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,799
being uh temperate type of climates but

262
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,639
if you actually look at the altitude of

263
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,599
the regions uh Nairobi is at about 1700

264
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,399
m campala is about 18800 M and A lot of

265
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,278
these areas that are up north of campala

266
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,799
and Nairobi uh are close to 2,000 M and

267
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,240
so even though they're very close to the

268
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,679
altitude to even though they're very

269
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,600
close um to the Equator the high

270
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,879
altitude means that you have in essence

271
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,519
a temperate climate I visited Nairobi

272
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,480
last July and the high temperatures in

273
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,799
the day were 70° which was about 20°

274
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,360
cooler than here in Upstate New

275
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,759
York so it's actually um really good

276
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,959
climates with good irrigation for the

277
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,120
production of snap beans um as long as

278
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:25,799
you're at altitudes above about 1500 M

279
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,440
and the soil looks quite good the and

280
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,679
the soil and the irrigation is also very

281
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,680
high quality in most of these Highland

282
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,360
areas so the issues that tend to be

283
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,078
encountered um in these new areas that

284
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,800
are producing snap beans uh the

285
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,559
predominant issue is rust which is a

286
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,519
problem for uh plant biomass it's a

287
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:53,479
problem for Quality because the rust can

288
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,519
also get onto the pods which is uh a

289
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,480
very important issue for snap beins it's

290
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,679
an important issue for all Horticultural

291
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,680
crops we deal with marketable yield that

292
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,319
has to have sufficient quality when it

293
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,838
actually hits the

294
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,959
marketplace

295
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,560
um the other problem that we see if you

296
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:15,719
go down to lower altitudes uh this is at

297
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:17,799
about 1100 M at Homer Bay um and you can

298
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,959
just see from Charles's reaction and the

299
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,799
peach juice consumption the increases in

300
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,799
temperature that we're seeing by moving

301
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,159
down um a few hundred meters in altitude

302
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,000
so the issues that you have when you

303
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,679
move down to the lake Lake Victoria

304
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,600
region are ones that the temperatures

305
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,638
day and night are basically too hot for

306
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,920
efficient production of a lot of these

307
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,519
crops so we already started to look at

308
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,919
these two traits as the major

309
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,679
constraints to green bean production uh

310
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,759
when we were setting up this

311
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,919
project so we brought in collaborators

312
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,039
um that I've worked with in the past uh

313
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,679
Tim portel who some of you might have

314
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,000
recognized he was a graduate student

315
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,638
with Molly John here a decade or so ago

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,399
and also um Tallow Pastor corales uh

317
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,198
he's what you might call the world's

318
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,759
expert on common Bean rust spent 20 or

319
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,639
30 years at seat and he's now at USDA

320
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,919
Beltsville so Tim right now is based in

321
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,839
uh USDA in Puerto Rico and works on heat

322
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,599
tolerance in beans and tala works on the

323
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,079
rust

324
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,639
resistance so the rust is really a

325
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,638
problematic pathogen

326
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,519
whereever a common being is grown in

327
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,720
tropical and subtropical environments

328
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,399
it's not a major problem right here in

329
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,240
New York we sometimes see it at the end

330
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,679
of the

331
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,079
season uh but it is very severe it is

332
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,078
very limiting especially from a quality

333
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:51,000
standpoint for crops like

334
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,879
snapping so what we have with rust is

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,440
that we have many many different races

336
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,198
of it and this is what makes it

337
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,519
difficult to actually work with but a

338
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,198
lot of work has been done done in dry

339
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,198
bean in the past and some of this has

340
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,000
been transferred to snap Bean uh from

341
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:10,278
the genetic resistance standpoint so

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,278
there's there's approximately 13 genes

343
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:18,320
associated with rust resistance I say

344
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:20,360
approximately because um ur1 and ur2 are

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
perhaps lost and then they maybe have a

346
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,039
UR 13 and ur4

347
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,240
Gene um but the most interesting of

348
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:31,439
these and it's it's a very intriguing

349
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,360
Gene from resistance standpoint is the

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,279
ur11 and this is a gene that could have

351
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,519
a major impact on common beans worldwide

352
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:44,799
and it is being explored with multiple

353
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:47,078
programs um for its uh use in Rust and

354
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,758
what we see with that is that when we

355
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:53,479
have a rust pusle develop if there's a

356
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,120
resistant reaction it's normally a hyper

357
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,159
sensitive reaction in a gene for Gene uh

358
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,639
type of response where you see this

359
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:07,399
necrotic lesion ur1 is is very different

360
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,959
in the the resistance response is more

361
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,679
of a field-based

362
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:16,239
resistance so if the Spore lands on the

363
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,958
leaf it forms a very tiny colonization

364
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,639
that you really can't see unless you're

365
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:22,318
looking under a microscope because it's

366
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,639
less than half a millimeter so it allows

367
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:26,399
the pathogen to start to colonize before

368
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,159
the resistance comes in and you don't

369
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,600
have the classic HR response

370
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,639
this reduces The evolutionary pressure

371
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
um from a pest pathogen standpoint and

372
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,519
it actually makes the gene very very

373
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,839
effective against many of the races it

374
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,000
is actually uh of the 108 that are

375
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,720
stored USDA belts the ur1 gene is

376
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,519
resistant to 107 of the 108 races which

377
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,000
is pretty incredible for a major Gene

378
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,278
and a lot of it is related to the type

379
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,278
of resistant response we see

380
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,038
so the other trait that we're interested

381
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,599
in is um heat

382
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,919
sensitivity because snap Bean production

383
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,958
is essentially restricted to the

384
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,120
Highland

385
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,720
areas because of heat sensitivity and

386
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,519
what happens here is that if we have

387
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,600
moderate temperatures like in a

388
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:25,240
temperate climate we have normal flower

389
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,159
development but if you start to increase

390
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,599
temperatures uh particularly the

391
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,600
nighttime temperature it starts to

392
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,599
influence plant hormones the plant

393
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,639
hormones affect carbon

394
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,839
translocation and this affects the

395
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,120
reproductive capacity of the plant um

396
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:46,119
most predominantly high temperatures at

397
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:49,639
night affect the ability for the plant

398
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:52,359
to form functional anthers and to be

399
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,840
able to produce pollen so when you have

400
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:57,359
high temperatures the pods fail to

401
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,759
pollinate themselves and so you get a

402
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,759
big loss because of heat

403
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,879
and the heat sensitivity of snap beans

404
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,919
is the reason that these are really

405
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,880
restricted to these high altitudes above

406
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,280
1500 MERS where you have the more

407
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,760
temperate type of

408
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,759
climate so we've worked on heat

409
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,599
tolerance in beans for a number of years

410
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,158
I had a graduate student when I first

411
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:22,439
started here um Katie Martin rainy who

412
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,600
some of you may also know um she did her

413
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,038
PhD project on heat tolerance and we've

414
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:30,319
continued to work with Tim porch on this

415
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,119
as a collabor

416
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,038
um but we learned a lot during that

417
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,399
process about how we can actually look

418
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,038
for heat tolerance and how we can

419
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,200
actually test for heat tolerance and we

420
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,960
do have good facilities in Geneva from a

421
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,360
greenhouse standpoint we have these tall

422
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,798
green houses that are able to maintain

423
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:52,038
temperatures very well and we find by

424
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,158
going to a high temperature regime like

425
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:59,038
32° day and 27° night and then we

426
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:02,960
compare to an optimal house uh we can

427
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:05,119
see the optimal responses of plants to

428
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,519
heat stress to be able to select

429
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,719
breeding lines that are able to um

430
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,158
pollinate themselves and produce pods

431
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,240
under high

432
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,919
temperatures so during this process we

433
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,599
developed some heat tolerant snap beam

434
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,880
breed in lines uh that you can see up

435
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:28,839
here on the top left and we got two

436
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,559
lines from USDA in Beltsville that were

437
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,798
snap beans that had been developed with

438
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,319
the ur11 gene that we wanted to

439
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,319
introduce for rust and almost all snap

440
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:39,720
beans have the ur4 gene which

441
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:43,439
complements the ur1

442
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,759
gene so we initiated some population

443
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,480
development which included selectin for

444
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,879
heat tolerant plants in a controll

445
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,360
temperature environment which is a

446
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,679
greenhouse for a couple of

447
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,158
generations and

448
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,840
developing um inbred lines to the F5

449
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,280
generation

450
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,399
that we then wanted to test the presence

451
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,798
of the rust genes so we wanted to select

452
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,000
down lines that were first heat tolerant

453
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,279
but also contained or had brought in the

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,200
dominant gene for

455
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,960
ur1 so the ur1 is an important Gene but

456
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,240
it's also one that hasn't been

457
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,440
characterized for molecular selection

458
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,159
for example and working with rust races

459
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,000
is also very difficult because of the

460
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,320
ability to move them from even a state

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,119
to state um

462
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:35,079
from the standpoint of the risk of

463
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:37,959
release Etc so all of the evaluations

464
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:40,000
for rust resistance were done by

465
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,759
inoculating the breeding lines that we

466
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,960
developed and this was done in

467
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,640
collaboration with Tallow down in USDA

468
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,919
Beltsville so you can see here Charles

469
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,919
helping Tallow evaluate the responses

470
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,799
for ingression of these

471
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:59,320
genes and we were able to do these by

472
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:02,918
known responses of um of different rust

473
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:05,720
races so the identification of ur11 can

474
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,600
be done through its susceptibility to

475
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,798
race 108 but it's resistant to race 67

476
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,959
and vice versa the ur4 with its um

477
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,440
susceptibility to race 67 but um

478
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,200
resistance to race

479
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,038
108 so if we have a control line that

480
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,880
has neither the ur4 the UR 11 Gene we

481
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,640
see rust on both of the leaves as you

482
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,880
can see here and then breeding lines

483
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,520
were looking to identify lines so

484
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,919
multiple plants that exhibited the

485
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,759
resistance response to both ur4 and ur11

486
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,080
in the lines that had already been

487
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,079
selected for heat

488
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,798
tolerance so testing the materials in

489
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,640
the greenhouse um is a convenient way

490
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,278
especially if we live in Upstate New

491
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,520
York but we wanted to duplicate this and

492
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:58,798
see how theyve performed in a field

493
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,839
situation so this is where we've worked

494
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,639
with Tim on the south coast of Puerto

495
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,798
Rico where in summer it gets

496
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,038
um very hot for the entire season so we

497
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:12,759
have irrigated plots with drip

498
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,839
irrigation uh but we maintain High day

499
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,879
and night temperatures when we're

500
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:22,199
looking at the um the bean growth and

501
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,720
yield so growing these beans in the

502
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,400
south coast of Puerto Rico where they're

503
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,798
flowering in July and August puts a very

504
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,120
high level of heat stress on them so we

505
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,679
were able to test these lines in this

506
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,479
environment um at the same time that we

507
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,278
were looking at the African

508
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,278
trials and what is encouraging about

509
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,278
this is if we look at simple

510
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:43,720
correlations between work done in the

511
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,480
greenhouse and work done in the field

512
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,000
which are very very different

513
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,558
environments the two most important

514
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,278
traits for heat tolerance which is the

515
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:58,038
number of seeds that fill per pod was

516
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:00,278
highly significant and the total seed

517
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:02,319
weight that we get per plant highly

518
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,000
significant so the results that we were

519
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,480
seeing in the field in Puerto Rica

520
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,359
correlated in a very high way with the

521
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
traits of Interest with those that we

522
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,519
were selecting in a greenhouse which is

523
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,599
very encouraging because it's a rare

524
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,000
example of where controlled

525
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:22,079
environment um stress can actually be

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,079
duplicated in the selection of

527
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,720
plants so we also then had to try and

528
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,359
apply some of these materials in

529
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,919
introduce them essentially into

530
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:38,000
um some field testing environments in

531
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,880
East Africa and what we wanted to do is

532
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,119
take a selection of sites that were

533
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,799
going to range in

534
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,798
altitudes so we could take sites like

535
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:50,440
car katali which is a government

536
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,000
institution this is up towards campala

537
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,000
in Northwest

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,400
Kenya uh this is at 18800 M so this is a

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,159
very temperate very nice environment for

540
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
for production of snap beans the sort of

541
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,000
place that you would Target if you

542
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,798
wanted to produce vegetable

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,159
crops we started coming down through

544
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:13,759
temperat uh through um

545
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:17,600
altitudes MSO at 1500 and sabatia down

546
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:20,960
to our highest heat stress trial which

547
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:24,199
was at Homer Bay which is near Lake

548
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,079
Victoria uh a little bit less than 12200

549
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,440
meters AR rouer in Northern Tanzania has

550
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,639
um a fairly lowish altitude but it also

551
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,880
has some interesting Dynamics because

552
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,720
you have the Topography of the area with

553
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,120
the slopes means that you get a bigger

554
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,200
drop off in night temperatures so it

555
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,158
really reacts like an environmental

556
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,840
altitude that is a little bit higher

557
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,960
than it actually is with heat stress um

558
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:53,240
home Bay though this is definitely where

559
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,159
you get into a very marginal area from

560
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,720
the um from the temperatures that you

561
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,919
see for the production of this type of

562
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,798
crop

563
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:07,320
so in 2009 out of the six trials um we

564
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:09,000
had three we had a 50% success rate in

565
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,960
three of these trials and fortunately

566
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,759
this included the um high altitude trial

567
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,399
and the low altitude trial the other

568
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,798
three trials went down for um different

569
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:26,239
reasons not not always ones that you

570
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:28,720
would um expect uh kibos was attacked by

571
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,519
porcupines that destroyed the ENT tie of

572
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,839
plot which has nothing to do with any

573
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,158
kind of field

574
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,119
resistance um sabatia was a known site

575
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,559
that we planted at in collaboration with

576
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,479
seat which was a hot spot for root rots

577
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:45,240
so we expected this to go down we were

578
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,038
just seeing what sort of responses it

579
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,679
might have to a mixture of root rots and

580
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,798
then we had the MSO uh plot go down with

581
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,278
Bean flies but we did have very nice

582
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,519
trials with avrdc in aroua with uh a

583
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,839
site that has a strong connection with

584
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,839
sead you're actually at H Bay which is a

585
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,119
farmer training center and at k catali a

586
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:08,798
government institution in

587
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,398
Kenya um so we also as we were doing

588
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,759
these trials we also wanted to kind of

589
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:14,918
Advance some of the lines uh that we

590
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,640
were developing so they started to

591
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,600
replicate the type of bean that was

592
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,720
being produced in

593
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,079
Kenya uh the types of snap beans we see

594
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,200
here a very large Civ um meaning the

595
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,240
width of them they're about the size of

596
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,038
uh your finger perhaps s where those in

597
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,319
European markets are very slender um

598
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,879
long and they're known as French beans

599
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,519
and they are already the preferred type

600
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,278
for Western Europe

601
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:46,639
um Africa is an ideal place to grow

602
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:48,038
these because the um the high quality

603
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,520
that's demanded and the fact that

604
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:54,119
they're easily damaged really makes them

605
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,480
um an ideal candidate for hand

606
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,479
harvesting or hand labor and a lot of

607
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,079
Europe of course is mechanized so the

608
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,640
one thing that Africa has is a lot of

609
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,839
available labor and unlike a machine

610
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,919
that'll do a once over Harvest on a

611
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,480
field in Africa with a snap Bean field

612
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,600
you'll have people maybe go through and

613
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,960
pick the plants five or six times over

614
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,319
the course of development to pick the

615
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,480
ideal size of the

616
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,879
pods so we developed some appearance

617
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,558
with the initial

618
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,559
populations um that had three for heat

619
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,000
tolerance and one for heat sensitivity

620
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:32,079
but also one that were fixed with the

621
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,159
different rust

622
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:38,000
genes and then we started to uh develop

623
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,760
populations cross into three lines that

624
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,960
are targeted for Africa Amy and Theresa

625
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:47,119
are the most commonly grown uh varieties

626
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:51,440
terza has the rust Gene ur5 which is

627
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:54,678
quite effective in East Africa PV 712 is

628
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,840
a new uh popprint snap Bean that has the

629
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:02,240
ur1 Gene and then we also cross them to

630
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:04,639
a couple cple of um us cultivar msai

631
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,640
which is a small C for the US market and

632
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,519
Bronco which is the main Fresh Market

633
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,640
being grown in New

634
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,079
York we made a similar approach

635
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,080
developing all 20 possible cross

636
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,439
combinations selecting down for Civ siiz

637
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,599
heat tolerance and

638
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,399
rust and then in

639
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,879
2010 we basically

640
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,199
identified uh the sites that we thought

641
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,320
would work best for us

642
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,600
uh for evaluating these

643
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,678
materials so we ended up going in 2010

644
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,839
with a three sites with success in 09

645
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,038
Arusha H Bay and kitali and our

646
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,639
intermediate site which is between H Bay

647
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,759
and kitali and altitude at uh kerak

648
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,679
Omega which is another government

649
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,558
Institute and indeed we had uh very good

650
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,038
results here in the fact that we had

651
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,839
successful trials at all four locations

652
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,558
even though they had uh different levels

653
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,959
of pressure from

654
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,759
rust so this this whole process has been

655
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,159
quite interesting and it's enabled us to

656
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,919
form a lot of connections on a lot of

657
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,519
levels I mean International connections

658
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,120
government connections farmer Training

659
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:16,399
Center connections or even uh NGO

660
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,359
connections um and it really helps us to

661
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,719
start um looking at what we could

662
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,158
potentially do U being on the other end

663
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,319
of the planet but during the process of

664
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,519
these trials Charles was based in um

665
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,519
Western Kenya and he did a lot of the

666
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,759
evaluations for well how do these

667
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,319
materials develop actually perform if we

668
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,960
put them out in these Farms so there's

669
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,519
some interesting things came out of this

670
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,319
the heat tolerant parent lines that we

671
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,278
evaluated more from a comparable result

672
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,359
in

673
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,398
09 we found that when we go from the

674
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,798
High Altitude site to the high

675
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:53,038
temperature site we had very good yield

676
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,000
stability in appearance which we would

677
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,558
expect um with heat tolerant but we also

678
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,798
had very good rust resistance

679
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,319
this is actually um the rust resistance

680
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:07,079
response so there's very minimal drop

681
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,960
off and in the case of the ur11 that's

682
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:13,000
also the case so having the ur11 gene as

683
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,919
these three lines do we have very good

684
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,798
stability between a non-rust area and a

685
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,840
rust infected area those that don't have

686
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,119
the ur11 gene we see about 40 to 50%

687
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,678
drop off in yield because of the rust

688
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,798
that's present so the ur1 can make a

689
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,120
huge huge difference when it comes to

690
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,519
rust then if we look at heat if we go

691
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,359
from the High Altitude to the low

692
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,880
altitude site we have yield stability in

693
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,798
these appearance but now the ones that

694
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,679
have the rust Gene like the ur11 or the

695
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:49,480
ur5 they may have resistant to rust but

696
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,720
when you go to lower altitudes the heat

697
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,960
stress starts to knock the uh yield

698
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,200
performance down 40 50% so it really

699
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,880
demonstrates what we can do with some PR

700
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,080
simple work in a controlled temperature

701
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,679
environment to really make a major

702
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,839
difference to crops that are very

703
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,480
important for Enterprise and stability

704
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,119
for small holder Growers um throughout

705
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,079
East Africa and a crop that's definitely

706
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,759
expanding I when I visited last year

707
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,079
they're building a new coolant facility

708
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,599
outside kilamanjaro airport that is

709
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,720
similar to those at Nairobi and

710
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:29,000
alderette for export of uh cooled

711
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,519
vegetables so in the heavily rust

712
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,720
infected area these are the responses of

713
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,880
the lines that we have on a um Leaf

714
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,720
basis you can see that we see rust

715
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,960
resistance and then this is the type of

716
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,278
yields that we're seeing in some of

717
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,679
these breeding lines that we developed

718
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,319
these are the ones that we promising

719
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,798
having the rust resistance and you can

720
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,720
see if you take the yield from a plant

721
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:55,599
it's comparable with a Civ type with the

722
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,240
ur1 pop renor with Theresa um and they

723
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,359
actually were yielding much higher than

724
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,440
the variety

725
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:04,278
currently grown um that had the

726
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,120
comparative rust resistance so this is

727
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:07,798
um very encouraging for moving forward

728
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,518
and it's lines that we actually have

729
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:14,558
planted out again this year for

730
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,679
evaluation because what has already

731
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,480
happened during the process is when when

732
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,880
we were interacting with a lot of these

733
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,639
sites we started taking a wider interest

734
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,480
in really what's going on with

735
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:29,798
vegetables in Africa and what some of

736
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,159
the uh opportunities might be for thums

737
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:37,200
so one of the big one is sukuma Wiki

738
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:39,519
um sukuma Wiki is uh it's a kind of a

739
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,558
Portuguese trunca Brassica it's really

740
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,399
like a non-head in cabbage um it's

741
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,720
pretty much an ancient crop I mean it

742
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,719
may date back to Roman days and it's

743
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,000
something that's still grown in southern

744
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,639
Mediterranean areas it's a cabbage that

745
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,440
you basically harvest the plant during

746
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:00,879
the course of the season um and so it's

747
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,159
very popular in gardens in Portugal and

748
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,480
in fact um with a lot of the leafy green

749
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,000
changes that are happening with the

750
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,200
foodie market right now um some crops

751
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,638
like sukuma Wei and Portuguese truda are

752
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,440
already starting to take off with some

753
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:17,199
of the vegetable seed

754
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,200
catalogs but it is in the East Africa

755
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,880
community uh pretty much the most

756
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,240
importable important um leafy green

757
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:29,840
that's grown sukuma Wii is Swahili and

758
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,079
it translates as to the weak meaning

759
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,759
that if people are able to eat the

760
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,918
Brassica vegetable with their corn and

761
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:40,000
with the protein it allows them to have

762
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,159
enough food to last the week it's also a

763
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,759
very very important plant from the

764
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,320
standpoint of nutrition and

765
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:51,638
diversification of diet and it is really

766
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,879
consumed by um tens of millions of

767
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,479
people um if not hundreds of millions

768
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,320
throughout the Lake Victoria and East

769
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:02,278
Africa region and it's the the one

770
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:05,359
vegetable that people already know and

771
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:08,918
recognize um there's a lot of reasons

772
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,358
why people choose to grow this over say

773
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,199
cabbage um if you're harvesting it every

774
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,799
7 to 10 days during the course of the

775
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,239
Season you have uh a crop that's

776
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,919
available to you for the whole season if

777
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,358
you grow a crop like cabbage you might

778
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,158
have to put three or four months

779
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,598
investment into growing a crop before

780
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,559
you harvest it and it might be a crop

781
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,320
that may get damaged for any number of

782
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,799
re reasons that you put all of that

783
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,119
investment in without any type of

784
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,079
recovery so anyone that's in the East

785
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,399
Africa community is very familiar with

786
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,679
sakuma Wiki and the consumption of

787
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:46,398
it we had ended up meeting a lot of

788
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,599
people from a lot of different places in

789
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,480
this case this is this guy is involved

790
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,399
in Outreach and extension and and this

791
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,039
is in Northern Tanzania but it also

792
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,838
shows um where they're trying to

793
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,880
maintain some of these sukuma Wiki

794
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,639
plants to develop their own sources of

795
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,320
seed well based on the problems that

796
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,440
sukuma wikii has this is a very

797
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,400
dangerous game because contaminated seed

798
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,240
is the one thing that destroys crops in

799
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,079
these regions in particular Brassica

800
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:22,838
crops um so while there are efforts for

801
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,640
self seed production really um Rootin

802
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:28,239
seeds through East African seeds or some

803
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,920
of the outlet are the way to go

804
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,319
the problem is if you're a grower in

805
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,559
Africa it's not like going to a colored

806
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Johnny's catalog or an internet website

807
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,599
to choose what you want to plant this is

808
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,879
an example of a seed store that uh

809
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,480
growers in Africa would go to very

810
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,640
predominated by the grains and very

811
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,800
little exposure to any kind of

812
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,799
vegetables or vegetable seed at

813
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,200
all and yet you're starting to see

814
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,880
diversification um not just on the

815
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:05,358
stands but throughout the whole

816
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:08,318
communities cabbage is a crop that is

817
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:11,559
expanding exponentially in some ways in

818
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,719
Kenya the seed CS of it are going

819
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,799
through the roof because of the

820
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,000
urbanization that's happening it's a

821
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,160
storage crop that works very well with

822
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,440
supermarkets so people are starting to

823
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,598
look at cabbages and Alternate to sukuma

824
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,519
wikii because of the storability and

825
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,400
perishability

826
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,000
issues but as with sukuma wi

827
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,039
the the M the main problem that we see

828
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,960
is black rot black Root's a bacterial

829
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,318
disease zanth theonis

830
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,280
campestris it comes in through the water

831
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:43,079
and through the seeds or seed

832
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,480
contamination forms these characteristic

833
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,480
v-shaped

834
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,039
lesions these v-shaped lesions can take

835
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,800
over the plants and destroy your crop in

836
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,279
the case of cabbage but even in the case

837
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,240
of sukuma Wiki they can be damaging 50

838
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,920
to 80% of the leaves and if you have

839
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,598
these v-shaped lesions on the leaves

840
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,318
they're not marketable they're then fed

841
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,559
to

842
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,719
livestock so often times you can lose

843
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,599
80% of your sukuma wiy crop because of

844
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,519
this

845
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,838
disease um and in cabbage it's even more

846
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,920
of a risk because you risk losing your

847
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:20,279
entire crop this is a cabbage field in

848
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,159
Tanzania and if you look closely you can

849
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,839
see um black rots starting to appear in

850
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:31,519
the plants uh but this is one at about

851
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:36,519
2,000 M near katali in Northwest

852
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:38,318
Kenya this is uh this is the grower here

853
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,759
uh he'd had success for a couple of

854
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:43,039
years and this is a field that is large

855
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,319
by African standards it's about four or

856
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,480
five

857
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:48,400
ACR this was all cabbage none of this

858
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,559
has been

859
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,720
harvested this is what happens to a

860
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,920
field when you plant cabbage with black

861
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,719
rot on the seed you get nothing which

862
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,358
was devastating for the grower and you

863
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,159
have a problem like that it may be a lot

864
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:08,039
of years before you think about planting

865
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:10,318
cabbage or vegetables again so the types

866
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,960
of crops that are grown are very

867
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:15,920
important and the issues with sales

868
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,838
distribution channels in Africa are very

869
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,838
problematic um there's three main

870
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,279
suppliers in Africa a lot going through

871
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,960
East African seeds but it's predominated

872
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,640
by by the South

873
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,318
Africans and it locks out a lot of seed

874
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,159
companies from

875
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:34,239
uh Mark in materials that would be uh

876
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:37,639
much more appropriate for

877
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,559
Growers so we started to discuss some of

878
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,960
these issues from a diversification

879
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,400
standpoint and what we could do U with

880
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,720
vegetable

881
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,400
brassas uh this is meeting in kumu um a

882
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,358
year or so ago but Charles who's now

883
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,440
back in Kenya even though he's uh sort

884
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:58,199
of working as a sweet potato breeder for

885
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,400
sip across Western Kenya and Uganda

886
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,719
um has now started up his own company

887
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,200
with um Dan

888
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,118
nanok um and it's really to try and uh

889
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:13,480
find underserved markets for seed in

890
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,800
Western Kenya um and so we started to

891
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,838
work with them through um a foundation

892
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,400
grant that we got from the Atkinson

893
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,880
Center and

894
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,519
sead uh to look at uh how we could

895
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,000
actually get some um Improvement of some

896
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:32,920
of the crops for these areas and also

897
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,358
look into some of the crops that perhaps

898
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,119
could be grown that aren't so uh with

899
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:44,199
Charles and Dan having set up um

900
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:46,400
Advantage crops limited this gives uh a

901
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:49,159
really important kind of penetration

902
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,079
into a highly underserved market and

903
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:54,879
some very unique

904
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,920
opportunities the the one that we

905
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,119
started to focus on of course was sukuma

906
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,720
Wii cuz such an important crop in Africa

907
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,800
we started making back crosses of race

908
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:09,239
non-specific black rot to this back in

909
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,039
2008 and it's an effort that it doesn't

910
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,479
require a whole lot of labor but it does

911
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,960
require a lot of time because brassas

912
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,679
tend to take about a year to go from

913
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,079
seed to seed with

914
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,279
breeding but we have been working on

915
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,200
black rot resistant in cabbage for a

916
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,040
number of years and so we started backd

917
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:29,239
draing it to sukuma Wiki because it is

918
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:33,480
the same species just in non-heading

919
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,639
type so we also started to look to well

920
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,280
what types of cabbage are actually being

921
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,559
produced in East Africa and what are the

922
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,680
varieties that are actually being

923
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,400
grown and part of the problem is access

924
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,598
to the correct

925
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,599
varieties this is a cabbage variety that

926
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,599
would have been grown in New York 30 or

927
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,000
40 years ago most cabbage varieties here

928
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,440
now are hot water treated for seed so

929
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,639
they have really very little Passover

930
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,599
black root from a seed standpoint but if

931
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,039
you do get black rot in the field you

932
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,480
see how the varieties start to come down

933
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,920
whereas a lot of the newer varieties

934
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,119
Thunderhead from reads um you know this

935
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,200
is a seus one blue Dynasty but you can

936
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,559
see the level of Black Rock resistance

937
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,759
in an inoculated field is significantly

938
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,480
lower so having access to resistant

939
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,400
varieties uh of cabbage as those markets

940
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,199
start to expand is also very important

941
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,838
not necessarily from us developing the

942
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:34,519
materials here but actually helping them

943
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,239
gain access to those types of cultivar

944
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,199
and

945
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,719
materials we're also looking from a

946
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,879
standpoint of the different types of

947
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,159
leafy greens that could be consumed we

948
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,920
we started looking uh while Charles was

949
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,279
here back in about 09 at a lot of

950
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,400
different leafy brassas there there was

951
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,880
a collection trip done in about 2000 um

952
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,200
right across the

953
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,119
southeast and it was was done with a

954
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,559
breeda who's a collaborator on a federal

955
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,160
project with me but also

956
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,599
um somebody who was really familiar you

957
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,679
know with the areas and

958
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,200
anthropology and they went around the

959
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:15,199
southeast and they collected uh about a

960
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,519
100 different land races of collards

961
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,318
that really vary dependent on all of the

962
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,599
different

963
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,719
communities um across the southeast and

964
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,640
a lot of them AC course African-American

965
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:28,799
communities so we planted these collards

966
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:30,920
and tried to start to Identify some real

967
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,280
variation in the leaf types and the

968
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,599
plant morphologies that were there from

969
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,680
these land races that had basically been

970
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,318
selected for quality and edibility over

971
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,879
a number of generations in the

972
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,960
US

973
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,640
so we've really started to look at um

974
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,159
not just the disease standpoint or the

975
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:58,159
alternative cul of our standpoint or the

976
00:42:53,159 --> 00:43:00,879
alternative uh plant type but but we

977
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,879
also have to look from a standpoint of

978
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,559
education

979
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,838
and one of the hard cells is F1 hybrid

980
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,079
seed um people don't want to buy seed

981
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,039
that costs 10 times as much as the seed

982
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:18,280
that they've always grown or five times

983
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:21,039
as much but you could see a hybrid

984
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,519
sukuma Wiki here compared to a

985
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:27,838
non-hybrid just on a shio biomass

986
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:30,599
standpoint and sometimes paying some

987
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,759
extra money for the seed can double the

988
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,680
yields that you get off a lot of these

989
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,160
crops so there's a lot of areas that

990
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:42,199
need to be looked at and promoted to try

991
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,960
and get the right materials into the

992
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:48,598
hands of a lot of these Growers this is

993
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,880
at USA in Tanzania uh which is at an

994
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,359
afram site which is a nonprofit Venture

995
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,358
from east west seeds and uh rexb in the

996
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,358
Netherlands

997
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,039
we can also start looking at crops that

998
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:04,559
are not brass oraia this is Ethiopian

999
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,759
mustard and you can see the biomass of

1000
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,559
this is significant where it's growing

1001
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,880
almost 2 meters in height so these are

1002
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,519
types of crops where you can really

1003
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,079
start to exploit um both the yield and

1004
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,960
the fact that there's um a lot of

1005
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,960
openness to the types of leaves that are

1006
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,000
consumed within the

1007
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,920
diet so over the last three or so years

1008
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
we've been doing trials here in Geneva

1009
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,680
and what we've been trying to do is

1010
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,400
identify a subset that we can introduce

1011
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:37,000
and evaluate um some with some of these

1012
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,000
partners and connection sites that we

1013
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,280
have in Africa so we've been looking at

1014
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,239
some breeding materials some varieties

1015
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,440
but also um a lot of these accessions

1016
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:50,799
that we've identified from the

1017
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,679
USDA a lot of these we have in limited

1018
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,720
seed supplies so we've had to develop

1019
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,799
our own seed to um put forward as part

1020
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:59,399
of these studies of course

1021
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,599
some of them develop seeds better than

1022
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,519
others this is a plant that we

1023
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,480
vernalized and it's about uh 4 M tall

1024
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,358
possibly the world's tallest barassa

1025
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,159
it's it's actually a sukuma Wiki that we

1026
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,440
just couldn't get to seed no matter how

1027
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,960
much we

1028
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,838
tried um and so we came together uh last

1029
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,440
year in particular to see how are we

1030
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,078
going to start to exploit these

1031
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,960
Partnerships and and start to look at

1032
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,160
some of these alternate types of plants

1033
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:36,400
as they fit the market so this is up in

1034
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:39,279
katali with um Thomas uh gubo who's our

1035
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,519
collaborator at the K katali site uh

1036
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,240
which is one of the sites we've been

1037
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:44,639
planting at this year we've planted at

1038
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,519
four sites in Kenya and two sites in

1039
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,598
Tanzania and we're looking for a lot of

1040
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,440
diversification of types not like you

1041
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,280
might expect in the US which would be

1042
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,280
more based on color and Aesthetics we're

1043
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,119
looking at it more from a practicality

1044
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,160
standpoint

1045
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,599
so you have the crops that are similar

1046
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:05,598
to what are consumed with sukuma wiggi

1047
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,800
which is this kind of Portuguese trunc

1048
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,000
UDA type where you get the Stacked

1049
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,359
leaves that you would Harvest during the

1050
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,280
course of the

1051
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,639
plant um but we're also starting to

1052
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,880
introduce a lot of stuff that is both

1053
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,279
commercially available as F1 hybrids and

1054
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,680
stuff that we've selected from the

1055
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,760
collards that were collected from the

1056
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:28,558
southeast of the US so this would be

1057
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:32,319
kale which curious ious ly enough has

1058
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,240
just exploded in the US market I I was

1059
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,480
speaking to Dutch seed Sellers and they

1060
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,358
say for 25 years we've had kale seed

1061
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,159
anybody wants kale seed we have it

1062
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:43,279
overnight kale seed sales doubled and

1063
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,920
nobody has any kale seed anymore it just

1064
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,839
came from

1065
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,440
nowhere um this is um another type of

1066
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:53,519
kale so we're just looking at how some

1067
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,519
of these different uh Leaf morphologies

1068
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,519
are really accepted from an aesthetic

1069
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,159
and cooking standpoint with the people

1070
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:03,079
and communities that we're targeting

1071
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,440
this is a Russian tetrol kale that has a

1072
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:09,480
little bit more Vigor some color in

1073
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:12,639
it high biomass Collard that we've

1074
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,159
developed and then some that vary in

1075
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:19,279
just the color

1076
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:21,639
size um the texture of the leaf just to

1077
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,079
try and get feedback from people about

1078
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,480
which of these leafy brassas they would

1079
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:31,880
prefer um

1080
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:35,318
this is more of a um standard Collard

1081
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,119
type this has more of a veiny type of

1082
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:40,800
look which probably looks a little less

1083
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,160
edible but interestingly some of these

1084
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,960
ones like this is a top Bunch this is

1085
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,440
one of the top sell in F1 hybrid

1086
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,039
collards throughout the southeast of the

1087
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,079
US from beo seeds and jles is super

1088
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,719
excited about this and how it may do in

1089
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,119
the African Market but of course they

1090
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:59,358
have no access to seed because they have

1091
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:02,039
no access to to beo seat channels um

1092
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,519
through the Distributors that exist uh

1093
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:07,519
there's also a a new variety Bonanza

1094
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:09,880
that is very similar to um a sukuma Wiki

1095
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,880
type that is incredible for biomass and

1096
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,000
also an F1 hybrid that very much fits

1097
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,800
into the

1098
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
community so this summer we've been

1099
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,318
having trials at these sites where a lot

1100
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,239
of these materials have been grown

1101
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,920
they've mostly been overseen by Dan this

1102
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,598
is at the hom of bay site with his

1103
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,039
characteristic

1104
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:33,240
tump and and we've included both the

1105
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:34,800
cultivar the colard selections and even

1106
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,519
the breeding lines or preliminary

1107
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,400
breeding lines that we have so this is

1108
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,400
materials we started in 2008 where we've

1109
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,000
developed the non-heading sakuma Wicky

1110
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,280
types with black rot resistance uh that

1111
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,358
we're testing out there um and then

1112
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,359
these are being an oent for uh pharmer

1113
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,798
evaluations um in this case it was

1114
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,358
actually some people from Cornell

1115
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:00,480
associated with the mcnight group that

1116
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,558
were passing through visiting for corn

1117
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,760
but even small sites like this have

1118
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,760
gotten some attention This Is the

1119
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,920
personal assistant to the Ministry of

1120
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,920
Agriculture in Kenya so you know you can

1121
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,760
have some small sites experimenting with

1122
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,000
some small plots but they they very

1123
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,319
quickly can get exposure as important as

1124
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,318
Agriculture and food is to the Kenyan

1125
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:26,279
Community um unfortunately I was unable

1126
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:28,798
to go in September because I had a um a

1127
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,960
side impact Collision that dislocated my

1128
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:33,199
kneecap unfortunately I had surgery a

1129
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,760
few days later uh but I will be going

1130
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,598
back this November and what we're doing

1131
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,960
with these materials is we're replanting

1132
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,920
them for not just Pharma trial sites but

1133
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,358
we're Charles and Dan are also going to

1134
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,240
be doing uh cooking trials with amongst

1135
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:48,639
a lot of people to see how these

1136
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,798
actually taste and how they're actually

1137
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:54,199
received by the different

1138
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:58,318
communities so going forward I think

1139
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:01,558
that the opportunities are a really

1140
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:04,358
pretty staggering um because there's

1141
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,119
really a grounding of the only way to go

1142
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:09,078
is

1143
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:12,119
up um and I think that with Advantage

1144
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:17,240
crops having being set up this actually

1145
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:19,720
gives a a nice kind of um entry into the

1146
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:22,558
market that's really heavily protected

1147
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:25,000
to many respects and I was having

1148
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,798
conversations with um a lot of the

1149
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,920
people at beo a couple of weeks ago and

1150
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:32,920
what we're trying to do is set up um

1151
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,880
Charles and Dan with um the product

1152
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,599
manager for Africa and Middle East so

1153
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,119
they can act in some type of reseller or

1154
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,880
agent capacity for beo seeds because beo

1155
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,559
really have a lot of these kales and

1156
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,559
cads and F1 hybrids that really are what

1157
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,798
the Growers need not what they have

1158
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,519
access to in the current

1159
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,280
climate

1160
00:50:53,519 --> 00:51:00,880
um so as we go forward

1161
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,280
I the trend in Africa certainly is

1162
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,920
towards

1163
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,400
urbanization the population is

1164
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,838
increasing in Kenya in the last 20 years

1165
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,920
it's gone up 50 60% the population in

1166
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,719
cities has

1167
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:17,559
doubled so it's very difficult to

1168
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:20,078
support sustainable agriculture on very

1169
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,720
small farms with corn and beans when you

1170
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,240
having in population increases um

1171
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:28,118
occurring at that rate it's making mean

1172
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:30,838
a lot of people mve to cities so small

1173
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,798
farms are no longer becoming sustainable

1174
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,279
the opportunities for vegetables and

1175
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:37,639
Horticultural crops from a

1176
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,160
sustainability and Enterprise standpoint

1177
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:43,000
um really are pretty phenomenal for a

1178
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,920
lot of these Farms because so many of

1179
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,480
these areas are at these high altitude

1180
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,358
sites that have very much of a temperate

1181
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,400
climate ideal for floral and vegetable

1182
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,960
crop production and yet in a lot of this

1183
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:00,519
land we're just seeing staple crops like

1184
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:03,159
corn and beans being grown um so as we

1185
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:05,838
go forward uh we hope to kind of be

1186
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:10,358
involved with that and capitalize on it

1187
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:13,558
um and this of course has been aided by

1188
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:16,279
uh a number of supporters both for um

1189
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:18,599
Charles's work which included assistant

1190
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,960
ship for RO in Africa and uh Agra

1191
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:23,079
support Alliance for Green Revolution in

1192
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,760
Africa but more recently the support

1193
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,318
that we've also had in the bras work

1194
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,520
from the Atkinson Center academic

1195
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:32,480
Venture fund and CAD with Chris Barrett

1196
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:35,480
here

1197
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,119
um I also of course want to thank my

1198
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,960
group we do a lot more than just this

1199
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,760
Africa work we have a lot of different

1200
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:46,440
projects going on which is not easy to

1201
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,119
uh hold together at times um this is our

1202
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,880
summer group a number of us are

1203
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,039
represented out at the back here which

1204
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,240
are the people you might not recognize

1205
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:57,318
as part of this

1206
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:58,959
group um but that's just

1207
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:03,358
really giving an overview of something

1208
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:05,838
that is ongoing in many respects because

1209
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,920
uh I plan to be out there in a few weeks

1210
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:11,000
to see how some of these materials are

1211
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,960
coming along and to really explore um

1212
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,920
where we can go to take the next step

1213
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,599
with this essentially so if anybody has

1214
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,599
any questions

1215
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:32,199
that's G I would urge that uh The

1216
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:35,680
Establishment testing and sale of

1217
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:37,199
adapted African card whatever you call

1218
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:41,199
them and it doesn't matter what the

1219
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,879
origin is but uh I mean find black Rod

1220
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:47,598
is difficult but heat treatment can take

1221
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,358
care of it and and as soon as a a local

1222
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,318
industry can get going it doesn't have

1223
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:54,119
to depend on imports from Beil I would

1224
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,558
think that that would be the sustainable

1225
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,400
solution I wonder to what extent you're

1226
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,760
working in that direction it's difficult

1227
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,680
to produce seed for cabbage in East

1228
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:07,280
Africa because is the vernalization

1229
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:11,039
requirement go to the higher altitudes

1230
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,720
um but yeah the the there's a number of

1231
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,880
things that really need to be addressed

1232
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:18,639
it's Outreach and education to Growers

1233
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,519
is very important the benefits of

1234
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:24,639
resistant varieties or hybrid varieties

1235
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:28,079
very important but also trying to move

1236
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,960
through appropriate materials uh help to

1237
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,119
Target some of these trads for some of

1238
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,760
the materials Black Rock would be

1239
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,318
important not just for cars and Africa

1240
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,680
it's important um throughout the world

1241
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:41,920
it's the major

1242
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:45,879
limiting disease of

1243
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,880
braus um there is a a strong and

1244
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,400
bureaucratic link between a lot of these

1245
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,838
groups like government and East African

1246
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,039
seeds and some of the distribution

1247
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,318
channels there's the T to be a very

1248
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,000
strong presence of the Japanese

1249
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:05,358
varieties in brassas s in particular was

1250
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,199
one of the major distribut in Africa but

1251
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,440
even the stuff that's that's rooted

1252
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,719
really through a lot of the South

1253
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,960
African apps they they predominate a lot

1254
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,039
of how the sales actually work

1255
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,318
especially from the hybrid variety

1256
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:22,599
standpoint I think that some of the

1257
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:24,480
props like less valuable or they just

1258
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:27,240
run through

1259
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,119
institutions like governments but yeah

1260
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:33,719
hot water treatment of seeds could

1261
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,720
really change the game U because that

1262
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:37,759
field I showed you was devastating I

1263
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:41,759
mean that was clearly a case of C

1264
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,799
cabbage variety the the seat was highly

1265
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,319
contaminated and when the variety

1266
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,639
susceptible or resistant that's

1267
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:50,239
something we even if was susceptible it

1268
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:50,239
wouldn't be that

1269
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:57,719
bad okay we really are out of time but

1270
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:57,719
again Griff thank you so much

1271
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:08,119
this has been a production of Cornell
