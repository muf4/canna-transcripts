1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,798
University hello my name is keny

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,559
Rodriguez I am a PhD student at Cornell

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,160
and I'm with I'm Chris smart I'm a

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:16,079
vegetable pathologist at Cornell and

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,118
today we're at a kid field so um and

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,038
this is specifically cucumber so Chris

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,320
what do we have here why does these

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,880
plant look like they are like wilting or

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,039
dying yeah so this this plant um is

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:32,439
dying you're exactly right and let's try

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,840
to figure out what the issue is so we

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,558
can see that there's just a lot of

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,640
Browning of the

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,799
leaves um and and it it just doesn't it

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,558
doesn't look healthy you can see there's

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,759
a lot of Wilt as well and when you look

18
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:52,119
around the plant you'll also see some of

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,519
these bright yellow cucumber beetles now

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,679
sometimes those beetles uh have stripes

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,519
black stripes on them sometimes they

22
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,960
have spots so there's the spotted

23
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,280
cucumber Beetle and the striped cu

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,599
cumber Beetle but both of them transmit

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,920
a bacterial disease uh the name of the

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,839
disease is bacterial Wilt the name of

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,599
the bacterium is called erwinia

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,000
Tropa do all the uh beetles can have the

29
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,118
bacteria in them so if I see one Beetle

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,879
I will have the disease of mbits no and

31
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:28,078
in fact the the bacterium the bacterium

32
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,478
is inside the Beetle and uh when the

33
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,438
beetle feeds on the plant that's when

34
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,519
the bacteria moves into the plant and

35
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:38,478
gets into the veins and clogs the veins

36
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:41,399
of the plant but um The Beetles actually

37
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,519
over winter in the soil and if it's a

38
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,359
really cold winter more get killed off

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,078
and you won't see as much bacterial wil

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,840
the next year but if it's a warmer

41
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,758
winter then we you know you won't lose

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,359
as many cucumber beetles in in the

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,640
wintertime and then it'll be a much

44
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,799
worse year not every cucumber Beetle

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,560
will have it but

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,320
um as soon as one plant gets infected

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,719
then other cucumber beetles that visit

48
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,639
it can pick up the bacterium and spread

49
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:13,280
it to other plants so Chris you

50
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,119
mentioned that the the colder weather is

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,598
the the less cook barbos we will see CU

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,920
they will get killed off so are things

53
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,759
like plastic mulch or any other type of

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,639
mulch that provide like warmer

55
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,919
temperatures will um help the kumber be

56
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,878
to survive maybe yeah I mean most most

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,199
people will pull up the plastic mulch in

58
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:35,959
the winter anyway um so so you know

59
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,799
plastic mulch is actually great the the

60
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,360
problem with raised beds and plastic

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,439
mulches with cucurbits is that as you

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,920
can see right here the the fruit fall

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,598
off of the plastic of the raised bed and

64
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,000
they end up um you know in in the lower

65
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,000
area where they might be sitting in

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,639
water if it's a real wet summer like

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,598
we've had this year so cre as you also

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,318
said that the cucumber beetles uh feed

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,598
on the on the plant is there a specific

70
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,560
part of the plant that they have to feed

71
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,759
on or in order to transmit the disease

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,920
no so they don't they can uh they can

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,719
feed on any part of the plant a lot of

74
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,359
times you'll see them inside the flowers

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,479
and that's not going to be where uh

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,519
they're transmitting the most um they'll

77
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,119
they'll you know when when they get into

78
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,239
the the vein tissue um that's when

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
they're going to transmit the bacterium

80
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,599
into the vein and it can be a leaf it

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,519
can be a stem it can be the crown um it

82
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,878
can be any any part of the cucumber

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,959
plant and sometimes in a cucumber plant

84
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,120
actually you'll see like oh half the

85
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,719
plant is really wilting and the other

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,480
half isn't and that's probably because

87
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,080
the cucumber beetles fed on one part of

88
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
the plant and the bacterium hasn't

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,040
gotten to the crown or the other side of

90
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,759
the plant yet speaking of the crown do

91
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,598
you mind if I pull this up yeah all

92
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,719
right let's see what it looks like so

93
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,840
one of the things that you can tell the

94
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,598
difference

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,799
between uh bacterial Wilt and some of

96
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,318
the other root rotting diseases is that

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,640
you'll still have

98
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,078
um fairly decent Roots if you look here

99
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,878
you know when when I pulled it out

100
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,040
there's there's still a decent root

101
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,560
system uh in this incredibly wet soil

102
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,679
because it's been very wet this year

103
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:19,040
yeah um if it were uh pythium you might

104
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,319
see the roots be really really degraded

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,919
and the outer cortex might Slough off um

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,319
if it were a perhaps a fusarium you they

107
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:30,839
might be kind of pinkish uh but in this

108
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:33,719
case what you see is that the crown just

109
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,000
is looking incredibly unhealthy and if I

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,000
can break it open you know sometimes

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,319
it'll even look yellow or watery on the

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,800
inside and that's just a you know a sign

113
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,240
of bacterial W but a classic test for

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,960
bacterial Wilt is that people will cut

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,160
the plant at a crown or or at a stem and

116
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,799
put that stem into a glass of water and

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,360
within a minute you'll actually start to

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,079
see the bacteria streaming out of the

119
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,800
bottom and you think about this poor

120
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,599
Plant it's like its veins are just

121
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,759
completely clogged with the erwinia

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,280
bacterium so much so that if you put it

123
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,879
in a glass of water the bacteria will

124
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,638
just start streaming out is this how the

125
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,759
plant look like whenever it um isos

126
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,680
starting off or we will see like what

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
will be the earlier symptoms that we see

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
and that we can detect yeah so the

129
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,000
earliest symptoms are going to be

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,439
welting with bacterial Wilt it doesn't

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,399
get quite as yellow as you might see

132
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,719
with a disease um like uh cucurbit

133
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,879
yellow uh Vine decline it doesn't get

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,199
nearly as yellow and you see wilting

135
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,600
first the thing is is that on a hot

136
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,639
summer day you might see wilting in the

137
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,199
afternoon and then the next morning it

138
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,160
doesn't look wilted at all and so you

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,759
think oh it was just hot out the plants

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,240
got wilty and and and it's okay that

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,280
could be a first sign of bacterial Wilt

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,439
the other thing it could be is that uh

143
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:06,719
there's a disease uh phyo caused by phyo

144
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:10,160
capsy whole different type of pathogen

145
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,520
and that can also attack the crown and

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,120
cause that same symptom so it can be

147
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,198
really tricky to differentiate between

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,918
some of the many diseases that we have

149
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,560
on our uh cucumbers here in New York so

150
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,240
what will be your recommendation whether

151
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,160
to diagnose a disease and also a

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,000
management technique that you recommend

153
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,840
you can um you know do the do the put

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,079
the stem in the glass test to see if

155
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,198
there's bacterial streaming um and you

156
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,439
can also send don't send the whole plant

157
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,759
but you can send a portion of the plant

158
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,120
say from The Roots up to maybe a foot to

159
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,120
your Diagnostic lab and they can tell

160
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,840
you really relatively quickly if it's um

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,800
bacterial wilter knut in terms of

162
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,079
control strategies um controlling the

163
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,720
Cucumber beetle is really the best way

164
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,439
to go and and that can be hard to do in

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
a year when when there's a a lot of

166
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,439
beetle pressure uh another researcher at

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Cornell is doing a super cool study that

168
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:10,319
looks at using low tunnels that are

169
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,198
Maybe This Tall uh to cover up the

170
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,840
plants when they're young and that way

171
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
it's it's like a row cover but it gives

172
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,198
the plants a little more height they're

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,039
called misot tunnels and that actually

174
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,759
prevents the cucumber beetles from

175
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:25,079
getting to the plants when they're young

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,199
and that's when they'll do the most

177
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,878
damage so we're really excited to see um

178
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,240
what Dr Sarah py finds out there are

179
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,720
there also some um varieties that are

180
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,720
like less attractive to The Beetles

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,720
maybe yes absolutely and um uh plant

182
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,280
breeders have been working really hard

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,639
to find you know plants that are

184
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,198
resistant to the beetle uh so far to my

185
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,598
knowledge there hasn't been any

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,639
resistance seen to the actual bacterium

187
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,199
that's in the veins of the plant um but

188
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,840
there is resistance to The Beetles and

189
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,800
it's absolutely true that cucumbers and

190
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,918
melons are more susceptible to this

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
disease than the other cucurbits and

192
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,758
that is because maybe the Cucumber

193
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,120
Beetle are more attracted to this plant

194
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,520
certainly yep okay so thank you so much

195
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Chris um so if you want more information

196
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:16,198
you can look or um reach out to the

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Cornell vegetable website thanks Chris

198
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,319
have a great day this has been a

199
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,280
production of Cornell University on the

200
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,280
