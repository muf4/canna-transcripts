00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,790
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:04,790
University

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,620
Thank You Ronnie

4
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:16,128
offering a very nice place for me to

5
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:19,820
study here okay uh hello everyone and

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,590
hello to the guys at Geneva okay I'm

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,079
very glad to be here to share with you

8
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:26,899
some interesting stories about Cornell's

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:31,368
Punk reading history based on my study

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:34,399
here I understand that my talk today is

11
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:38,000
very closely related to the previous one

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,739
of this series which was given by dr. Li

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,679
cast on last Tuesday

14
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:45,409
dr. Lee Kass talked about the whole

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,119
history more than 100 years history the

16
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,179
whole story of Cornell's plant breeding

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:54,409
while my talk today actually is about

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:57,380
some episodes in that history and some

19
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:59,779
aspects of some background stories

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,969
especially in terms of the international

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,909
involvement of Cornell's

22
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,828
from breeding talking about the

23
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,170
international involvement of done

24
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:12,319
breeding here I think most people will

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,570
think about a very well knowing project

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,689
conducted by Cornell University plump

27
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:22,429
reading Department and university of

28
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:26,090
Nanking China so that project has a very

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,979
very long official name here but from

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,530
here we can know who are the parties

31
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:34,640
working on that project and where the

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,370
where the founding come from but we can

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,200
easily remember this project as a very

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:44,390
short name the Cornell Nanking story and

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,140
most people also think that this story

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,549
is a beginning of Cornell's

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,400
international involvement in the field

38
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:56,689
of Agriculture especially to offer the

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:00,049
assistance to China's agriculture but to

40
00:01:56,688 --> 00:02:05,769
my findings here I found the start point

41
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:12,769
should be much earlier when as early as

42
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:16,719
1897 in 1897 the first agriculturist

43
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:19,629
from Cornell going to China his name is

44
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,340
Gerald Riehl

45
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,310
he actually was boiling New York State

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,069
he had a family farm his family owned

47
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,129
the farm at that time he came to Cornell

48
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,519
to study agriculture in 1883 and after

49
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,900
five years he got his bachelor's degree

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,990
then he just went back to his family

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,840
farm - wrong that farm a few years later

52
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,340
he came back again for his graduate

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,520
study and also in the year of 1897 when

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,870
he came back in the same year he went to

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,850
China to help with the agricultural work

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,920
you may ask why why did he stop his

57
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,379
study and go to China because that was a

58
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,599
very early time it's really a kind of

59
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:06,069
matter of career courage a very

60
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,829
courageous trial to do that right so the

61
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:11,530
reason why he went here actually should

62
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,480
have started from this person this guy

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,879
is a very high-level or very influential

64
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:22,269
official in China at that time that was

65
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,729
in late Qing Dynasty that dynasty was

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,640
the last of feudalism dynasty in China's

67
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,739
history the late Qing Dynasty at that

68
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,399
time some of the officials or

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,379
intellectuals realized China needs some

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,950
reform especially in the fuse of

71
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:43,960
Agriculture so some of them especially

72
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:46,329
represented by this car decided to take

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,340
some reformed or take some trials to to

74
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:53,230
to do something on agricultural

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:56,370
improvements one of his trials is to try

76
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:58,750
to establish an agricultural school

77
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,759
although China has been leading in

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,919
agriculture for a very very long time

79
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,289
but that was a kind of traditional

80
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,679
cultural practice in terms of modern

81
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:10,840
agriculture he decided to have a school

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,209
to teach the Chinese people some more

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,969
than once some advanced agricultural

84
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,759
practice or technology oh I forgot to

85
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,100
talk about his name his name is Chun soo

86
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,639
don't he

87
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,590
Viceroy in province of central China

88
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:31,649
it's Hebei province of central China

89
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:34,079
where he decided to open us agriculture

90
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,929
school in modern sense he had to find

91
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,060
someone to work for him then he turned

92
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,879
to several foreigners who were in China

93
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,209
at that time for help to find a very

94
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,569
white person to do that job one of the

95
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:52,079
foreigners helped him his name is

96
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:54,990
Patrick he was a priest just working in

97
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,870
that province at that time he was a year

98
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,569
graduate but he didn't try to contact

99
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,550
his alma mater because he's thinking I

100
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,740
might be better in agriculture than

101
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:10,079
yield so he wrote a letter to Sherman

102
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,509
the third president of Cornell in

103
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,759
history and one more connection between

104
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,949
Sherman China is that after he left to

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,529
the presidency of Cornell here he was

106
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,319
appointed as the ambassador of the

107
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:25,049
United States to the Republican China

108
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,969
that's a later connection okay so

109
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,660
Patrick wrote this letter to Sherman and

110
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:35,970
Sherman give this letter to robbers

111
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,170
robbers was a Dean of College of

112
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:44,340
Agriculture Dan and he decided grill

113
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:47,490
might be the best candidate why because

114
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:50,099
the Viceroy requested that this

115
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,800
candidate should know well about modern

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,770
agriculture he should have a kind of

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,560
bility to teach agriculture as well as

118
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:00,959
to run a farm just like what I mentioned

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,420
Brill had the experience of running a

120
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,459
family farm and he learned agriculture

121
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,470
here so he might be the best candidate

122
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,829
to go to China

123
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:15,990
so finally real decided to take the job

124
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:19,800
then he went to China he went to try

125
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,870
just in the year of 1897 and after his

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,470
arrival in China he signs these

127
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,040
contracts with that Viceroy you can see

128
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,440
the contracts in english and chinese

129
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,720
languages and those contracts are still

130
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:39,319
kept in Canal archives very interesting

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,850
this M after one year I mean in the year

132
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:47,759
1898 Brill helped that Viceroy to

133
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,160
establish that I will culture school and

134
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,500
the school began to implore the first

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:58,350
group of civilian students in the year

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:01,110
of 1898 this is a notice or as for the

137
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:06,420
enrollment of that agricultural school

138
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,040
also kept in Canal archives and also in

139
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,590
that year I mean the first year of the

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,319
opening of that school real invited

141
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:16,949
another American people his cornelian

142
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:20,279
fellow Canadian named Gilmour to go to

143
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,959
China to work as his assistant so you

144
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,269
can see that from this picture there

145
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,269
were two American people with a group of

146
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:29,879
Chinese students but I should say

147
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:31,829
unfortunately they didn't I mean these

148
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,529
two guys didn't stay in China for a long

149
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:39,779
time because they cannot cause a lot of

150
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:44,129
difficulties for example one they too

151
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:48,449
would like to have a piece of field to

152
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:51,810
just build an experiment farm they had

153
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:54,149
to explain a lot to that Viceroy because

154
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,970
they will always ask how much money came

155
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,589
make from that farm because to Chinese

156
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,140
people's at that time to Chinese

157
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:03,839
people's concept of Agriculture they

158
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,819
just think oh the farm is just to make

159
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,789
money just to do agriculture production

160
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,310
just to get profit so they have to

161
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,810
explain a lot of times the experimental

162
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,149
farm is totally different from the

163
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,639
ordinary farm you cannot count on it to

164
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,189
make money you they are used for

165
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,589
experiment but they were not understood

166
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,089
well

167
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,679
that's one of the difficulties he came

168
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:30,289
across so just after three or four years

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:34,360
finally they to resign and come back to

170
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:38,840
America but one thing I would like to

171
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,240
mention in that reel has very good habit

172
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,389
he kept a very good collection of

173
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,700
different kinds of archives those

174
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:49,460
archives can to Cornell archives

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,080
I mean after his ass so you we can still

176
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,700
see a lot of pictures and newspapers

177
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,370
letters a lot of things different forms

178
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,570
in Cornell archives so those are very

179
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,789
valuable

180
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,070
I mean materials for people who are

181
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:08,000
interested in that part of the history

182
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:11,210
in Chinese agriculture you means you may

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,759
think hey this guy doesn't have anything

184
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,350
to do with camp reading because you're

185
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,899
talking about from reading in this

186
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,090
seminar right so the next thing I would

187
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,689
like to say is that his connection with

188
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:29,000
plant breeding is that before he went to

189
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:31,880
China he also visited that USDA and he

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,120
gotten kind of appointment he was

191
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:38,539
assigned as a special representative you

192
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,720
can see from this paper he was assigned

193
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:45,230
as a special representative of USDA to

194
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,160
China to do some investigation to do

195
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:52,070
some you know collection of the lung

196
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,370
resources in China so that means while

197
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,379
he was working for viceroy with that

198
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,710
agricultural school he also worked for

199
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,350
the usda to collect the plum resources

200
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,879
from the archives we know him from there

201
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,220
some some of the letters he wrote to the

202
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,250
usda we know that he once collected

203
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,800
quite a few different kinds of Klunk

204
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,889
resources and send them back the seeds

205
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:19,719
seedlings and those things were used a

206
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:24,080
later for trunk breeding experiment and

207
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:27,019
one more thing that Brio was connected

208
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,879
to plant breeding here is that after he

209
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,980
came back to america he actually had

210
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,669
been working on several farms as a

211
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:38,170
manager from the archives we know that

212
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:42,110
he kept very close and frequent

213
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:44,088
communication we start to love I think

214
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,798
you may know wo he walk he wants what

215
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,430
the head of the department of plant

216
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:53,519
breeding here from 1942 to 1949

217
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:58,439
and dr. love actually worked closely

218
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,169
with with Brio especially he talked love

219
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,780
did some research or experiment embryos

220
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:08,159
fun for for plant breeding or even for

221
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:11,189
extension work and dr. love by the way

222
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,860
he was also a very chief participant of

223
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,770
the Cornell Nanking story I I just

224
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,019
mentioned at the beginning before he

225
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,480
decided to go to China before he decided

226
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,929
to to have that project happen I mean

227
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,840
the Kony Onegin story happened he also

228
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:31,109
wrote the letters to brill to ask for

229
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,530
some suggestions or or some useful

230
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,169
information so there is another

231
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:41,549
connection between drill and Cornell's

232
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:43,259
plump reading but that's not mine and

233
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:45,990
that's not the main part of my story

234
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,860
today because those happened I mean Brio

235
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,629
went to China

236
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,909
that was in the Qing Dynasty not in the

237
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,009
Republic China the Qing Dynasty was

238
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,189
followed by the Republican China so what

239
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:05,159
I will focus on is a period of that

240
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:08,190
Republic China so within a period of

241
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,919
Republican China not only that was a

242
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,250
Viceroy I think more and more people

243
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:17,159
especially the officials and Inca

244
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,379
lectures they began to realize oh we

245
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,169
must do something on Chinese agriculture

246
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:27,259
it's there is a kind of urgent need to

247
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:28,469
improve on Chinese culture so that the

248
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,169
communication

249
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,500
in China and Western nations in terms of

250
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:38,309
agriculture developed very fast in that

251
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,549
period especially the sino us

252
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:43,399
communication in agriculture was the

253
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:46,219
fastest-growing one

254
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,028
I think this kind of communication took

255
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,759
place in two ways one if the Chinese

256
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:55,460
students came to studying in America

257
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,639
especially study agriculture here the

258
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,278
other way is that some if some American

259
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,759
agriculturists they won to China to

260
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,669
offer some help offer some instruction

261
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:12,100
beer all right we can just look at the

262
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:16,069
both of the ways the first way is the

263
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,649
Chinese people coming to America to

264
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,320
study agriculture I'm not trying to

265
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:23,778
glorify Cornell but I think talking

266
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,210
about sino-us communication in in

267
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:29,750
agriculture Cornell should be the one to

268
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,210
be named absent at first you can see

269
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,570
from the number from 1912 to 1927

270
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:39,019
altogether there are 170 students from

271
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,528
China they came to study in America for

272
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,750
agriculture among them 14 came to

273
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:46,220
Cornell that was the biggest queue

274
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,830
compared with a student to other

275
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,800
universities and in the following ten

276
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,520
years 190 students was sent by Chinese

277
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,049
government to study agriculture here and

278
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:00,519
one-third of them choose Cornell as

279
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:03,079
their University compared with the other

280
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,929
the students to other than University of

281
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:11,270
Michigan's Illinois's still the biggest

282
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:14,629
group so you can see Cornell isn't very

283
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:18,949
the first choice for the students to

284
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:21,500
study agriculture at that time and among

285
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:26,000
all the Chinese students come here this

286
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,190
guy should be named and I'm not sure

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,708
whether you know Chinese people all

288
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:34,220
American people know this guy very well

289
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:38,569
his name is who shoe doctor who she

290
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,389
actually graduated from Cornell and he

291
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,570
was considered as a key contributor to

292
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:48,649
China's language reform and liberalism

293
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,500
what's the connection between him and

294
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,958
agriculture actually this guy was

295
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,620
originally sent to Cornell to study I

296
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,199
will culture

297
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,750
but later he sought oh I'm not quite

298
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,570
interested in that I don't like that so

299
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,139
he changed his major to philosophy and

300
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,910
literature and he later worked as a

301
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,360
Minister of Education in Republic China

302
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:15,600
and one more thing interesting that is

303
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,470
that this guy also I he's a very

304
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,360
talented guy

305
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,269
he also took part in the English

306
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,070
speaking context of Cornell he beated

307
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,319
all the American students who speak

308
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,710
English as a native language and gods

309
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,270
our first Christ so yeah very

310
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:35,100
interesting but very talented people so

311
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:39,000
beside who she actually there are quite

312
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,790
a few very outstanding agriculturists in

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,399
the period of Republic in China actually

314
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:47,459
they graduated from Cornell then they

315
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,919
went back to serve their country alright

316
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,040
let's look at the other side the other

317
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,379
direction the American people

318
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:58,559
agriculturists going to China we should

319
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:03,588
name this one his name is Jung lossing

320
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:07,679
back he was a Canadian went to China in

321
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:10,500
1910s or something actually he was a

322
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:14,639
very person who established the first

323
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,230
Department of Agriculture economics in

324
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,809
China just the in the University of

325
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,170
Nanking and also he's a very person who

326
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:26,458
conducted the first investigation or

327
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:29,309
risk research on rural economy and farm

328
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,929
management in China so he was considered

329
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:33,479
actually a kind of father of the

330
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:36,659
discipline of agricultural economics in

331
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,659
China very influential still remembered

332
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,850
by people I mean doing agricultural

333
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:45,289
economics in China today but maybe also

334
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,290
to China to American people

335
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:55,960
most thing about him is that he got

336
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:58,810
married with her back this lady was a

337
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,570
daughter of a priest

338
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,189
in China then this lady actually was

339
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,170
born in China and grew up in China so

340
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,049
she spoke very good Chinese as well as

341
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:12,519
the English while after their marriage

342
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:15,338
she just went together with with dr.

343
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,129
buck to do those investigation in rural

344
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:21,789
areas and mainly just worked as a

345
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:25,689
translator or interpreter and later

346
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:29,680
probic wrote a novel named the good

347
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:32,170
earth based on his experience which is a

348
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,970
kind of a very vivid and good portrayal

349
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:39,460
of Chinese rural life in history and

350
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:42,339
because of that novel this lady was

351
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:48,190
awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature

352
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:50,319
in 1938 maybe he was saying hey you

353
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,269
should go to war to talk about to talk

354
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,569
about these guys because we are still

355
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:58,990
doing from breeding here I think so

356
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:02,428
the connection between this guy and from

357
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:06,549
breeding China is that the person

358
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:12,040
invited him to work in the university of

359
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:15,009
Nanking was Jung Henry Reisner that's

360
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:18,970
the main story I will talk about today I

361
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:21,609
will talk about this guy his life his

362
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,829
work his contributions in terms of plump

363
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:27,459
reading to Chinese to China's

364
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:30,189
agriculture before I talk about Reisner

365
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,860
I would like to have a few words on the

366
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,320
University of Nanking and the College of

367
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,109
their agriculture because at that time

368
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:42,220
he worked as a Dean of the College of Ag

369
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:43,119
agriculture in that University from here

370
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,100
we can see

371
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,250
the University of Nanking was funded

372
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:50,339
King was founded in 1918 eighty-eight

373
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,029
actually it was a private university

374
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:58,119
sponsored by American churches here and

375
00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:01,259
it was proud to be the first educational

376
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:05,469
institution in China officially named as

377
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,180
University in English before that most

378
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,759
of the I mean institution were called

379
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,640
schools or something not the university

380
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:16,480
this was the first one to use university

381
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,450
as an English name and it was once in

382
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,539
once registered with the New York State

383
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,400
Education Department what does that mean

384
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:27,490
that means the students graduated from

385
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,280
that University they could come directly

386
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,620
to any University here in New York State

387
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,839
without taking any additional tests

388
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:39,759
their academic achievement will be

389
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:41,949
approved and accepted here in the

390
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,720
College of Agriculture in that

391
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,610
university was one of the strongest

392
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,890
college it was considered as it was

393
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,049
actually the first Institute in China to

394
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:56,200
offer four-year bachelor's degree in

395
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:57,909
education in field of agriculture so

396
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,039
that it was considered I mean that

397
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,470
establishment of that college was

398
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,649
considered as a beginning of China's

399
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:10,480
modern higher education in agriculture

400
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:14,050
their meaningful step and that college

401
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,549
later involved into the current Nanjing

402
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,990
agriculture university that's a

403
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,099
university I'm now working with so

404
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,779
that's why I'm here I'm quite

405
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,730
interesting in this part of the story

406
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,170
okay so

407
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,539
I think one of the reason why the

408
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,509
College of Agriculture is very strong is

409
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:32,059
that it once got involved in the Cornell

410
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:40,960
Nanking project on the ranking story

411
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:43,639
project stop requested alright okay uh

412
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,670
yeah that's the reason why the college

413
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,390
was very strong just because of that

414
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:53,240
project those faculty will get we're

415
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,460
trained by the American experts and the

416
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,839
research research ability what improved

417
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:04,579
a lot of result achieved from that

418
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:06,980
project okay then I would just go on to

419
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:09,649
talk about the ricer under the guy

420
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,059
wisely you can see from here if you are

421
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,410
interesting in that story I would

422
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,409
recommend you to have a look up this

423
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,529
book it can be downloaded from online

424
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:23,050
now you can see from here actually this

425
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:28,160
book was co-authored by two persons

426
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:30,319
Reisner and talked to Liz I think yeah

427
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,330
this is a Chinese version we just

428
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,759
translated and published it in China I

429
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:39,199
got involved in translation so yeah I

430
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,400
like this story those are the two

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,400
authors

432
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,160
I think compared with dr. love Reisner

433
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,190
also did very great job in that history

434
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,580
in that project but he was not

435
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,830
remembered as much as dr. love so that's

436
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:00,199
why I would like to give you more

437
00:21:55,829 --> 00:22:05,009
stories and things about Weisner today

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:08,700
and first we should know how significant

439
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:11,670
this person is from the canal Alumni

440
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,480
news from a new story it was once said

441
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:17,340
to be perhaps the foremost Graduate

442
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,559
performing outstanding service to

443
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:24,209
agriculture by canal in China and here

444
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,139
is a buyer sketch of this person

445
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:31,200
although actually he did mostly he did a

446
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,020
lot of running mission work religious

447
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,910
service in other developing nations but

448
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,539
he also did a lot of agricultural work

449
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,340
so I still think that he is an

450
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:44,700
agriculturist he was born in Virginia

451
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:48,569
and grew up in Pennsylvania he went to

452
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:52,230
ear college in 1907 and after four years

453
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:54,149
he got a bachelor's degree in arts just

454
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,809
remember he got a degree in arts not in

455
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,610
agriculture and later just because of

456
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,109
his contribution to agriculture mission

457
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,000
work I'm not sure whether you're

458
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:05,939
familiar with agriculture mission work

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,009
actually in the history some American

460
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,140
churches they wish to combine the

461
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:12,539
mission work and agricultural services

462
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:16,500
together so that the churches can

463
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:19,740
participate more in those rural areas

464
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,130
services and to increase their influence

465
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,500
in those developing nations so actually

466
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,810
he devoted most of his life to the

467
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,630
agricultural mission work then he was

468
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:35,099
awarded the honorary degree of Master of

469
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:37,770
Arts in 1950 by his eminent modern year

470
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,809
university okay the year College

471
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:44,490
actually was the undergraduate college

472
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:51,690
of university in history and yeah

473
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:53,789
died in New York State he mostly yeah I

474
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,620
did most of the I were commissioned work

475
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,369
after he came back he came back from

476
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:01,769
China in 1931 after he came back he

477
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:05,069
basically worked with this organization

478
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:08,069
and he also in 1950s he once worked as

479
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:11,069
the observer for various church agencies

480
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:12,869
with FAO and also he was a member of the

481
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:15,169
Advisory Committee of the technical

482
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,489
cooperation administration that's the

483
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,730
that was also called the point full

484
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,460
program in history recommended by by

485
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,069
President Truman in American history

486
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,710
just mainly focusing on having some

487
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:31,649
cooperation technical cooperation with

488
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,400
other developing nations all right so

489
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:38,990
that's why he was also related to

490
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,990
President Truman's point full program

491
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:47,519
you may still have this question

492
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:50,850
he was year graduate a Bachelor of ours

493
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,710
how did he turn to do agriculture plumb

494
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:56,159
reading how was he connected with palm

495
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:59,250
reading so actually the story started

496
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,769
from this movement the student volunteer

497
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,859
movement of foreign missions because he

498
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:07,440
graduate in it from ill in 1911 that was

499
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:09,169
just the peak time of the student

500
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,670
volunteer movement of foreign missions

501
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,400
thousands of college student graduated

502
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,880
from university then they went to other

503
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:22,890
nations to do some religious service

504
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:25,610
full of passion and Reisner was one of

505
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,700
them and

506
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:31,459
from the oral history and also I tried I

507
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,850
tried to contact the descendants of half

508
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,289
of riser and his granddaughter

509
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:38,959
offered me some very valuable

510
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,269
information and documents from those

511
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,298
part of the image from those materials I

512
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:44,839
got to know that after he graduated from

513
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:48,440
yield

514
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:52,428
he was firstly offered a job to teach

515
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,840
biology in University of Nanking because

516
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:57,259
that university was sponsored by

517
00:25:53,839 --> 00:26:00,399
American churches so he was actually a

518
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:03,039
mathematics major in Neil

519
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,300
and he thought maybe I cannot teach

520
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,879
biology very well at that time he got to

521
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,490
know that the College of Agriculture

522
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,130
will be established in the university of

523
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,779
Nanking he thought hey and more

524
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,570
interested in teaching agriculture

525
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:21,700
because I was this an agriculture while

526
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,529
I was a young because he helped him you

527
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,759
know to do some farm work while he was

528
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:29,769
young but he still didn't think that he

529
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,430
has got enough preparation to teach

530
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:37,299
agriculture to China then he just came

531
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:41,019
to Cornell in 1912 to attend some summer

532
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:44,889
school courses that experience really

533
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:47,200
opened the eyes of reissner's to the

534
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:51,130
modern agriculture and advanced

535
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:54,340
agriculture then he decided to go on he

536
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:59,020
came back in 1913 to register for his

537
00:26:54,339 --> 00:27:01,689
master degree and under yeah his major

538
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:04,029
was farm crops and his minor was just

539
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:08,200
plunk reading under the professor

540
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:11,200
Gilbert he was also member of the plum

541
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,910
breeding departments synapses Club dr.

542
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,950
Leale talked about this club last week

543
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,690
it's a club for the plum breeding

544
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,289
faculty and students to meet regularly

545
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:23,740
to have dinners to have social lives to

546
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:26,019
even have seminars all right so from

547
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:30,700
this picture we can see this young

548
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:35,460
gentleman was wiser and his professor

549
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:39,069
Gilbert was sitting at the front row

550
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,750
yeah actually just in one year he

551
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:43,298
finished all the required courses for

552
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:46,319
his master degree not

553
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:49,679
he finished his courses in 1914

554
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,129
but he didn't have enough time to finish

555
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,220
his thesis then he had to go he had to

556
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,740
go to to leave for China actually he

557
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,808
finished the his thesis in China why he

558
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,278
was looking in University of Nanking his

559
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:09,500
thesis is about the wit history the the

560
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:13,230
wheat planting history in New York State

561
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,538
and also he got his master degree in the

562
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,210
year of 1915 while he was in Nanjing

563
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:21,929
yeah Nanjing is that the current name

564
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:25,829
the city used to be called Nanking but

565
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:28,919
now he's called Nanjing okay so yeah

566
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:32,519
before he went to China he got to know a

567
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:36,120
girl named Bertha bets that girl was a

568
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:39,329
auto student in a major of home

569
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,949
economics in the same College and before

570
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:43,378
he went to China he decided to take her

571
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:47,069
together was with him to go to China

572
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:51,449
then the NGO agreed they just went

573
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:54,990
together okay yeah while they were in

574
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:57,830
China mostly most of the time from I

575
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,808
mean upon his arrival in two years

576
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:02,128
Reisner was was working on the faculty

577
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:05,278
at the University of Nanking in the

578
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:08,278
College of Agriculture and for the rest

579
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,950
more than 10 years he worked as a Dean

580
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:15,148
or coding because for political reasons

581
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,190
sometimes they have to you know carry

582
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:19,378
out a system of the coding with the

583
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,409
Chinese people working as another coding

584
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:24,000
so that they were not you know rejected

585
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,250
by Chinese people just too for some

586
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,409
period of time in history so he worked

587
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:33,180
as adding or coding for more than 15

588
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:35,130
years yeah something about his

589
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,330
mrs. rice also did something while he

590
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,780
was in Nanjing

591
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:42,839
he developed a cookbook the purpose of

592
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:45,139
the dispo cookbook is to teach those non

593
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:49,619
Chinese people who were living at China

594
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,930
to use some foodstuff grown locally to

595
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,359
cook some dishes and that book was

596
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:57,690
actually published in also in English

597
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,659
and Chinese also you can get a copy from

598
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,120
Cornell archives okay if you wanna have

599
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,230
a look on this book alright let's go

600
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:10,399
back to Riesling story

601
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,558
a chi reissner's oral history and to the

602
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,200
literature I found actually why Scott

603
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,298
was the second person in China who had a

604
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,298
master's degree in either in either

605
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:22,730
agriculture or in forestry the first guy

606
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:24,859
was a Chinese person he graduated from

607
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,319
Michigan State University and majoring

608
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:30,558
in forestry then he went back earlier

609
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:33,319
then Reister but in the university of

610
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,339
Nanking he was a first person on the

611
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,839
faculty with any training in agriculture

612
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:40,548
considering the University of Nanking

613
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,119
was very leading in agriculture at that

614
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:45,950
time in China so we can see that

615
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,469
reissner's work might be very pioneering

616
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,080
of or running in China especially to

617
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:54,440
China's agriculture and competing okay

618
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:57,319
so rice the record almost anything that

619
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:02,259
when did in China at that time was a

620
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:06,829
first very meaningful insignificant and

621
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:09,710
wise that failed that his most notable

622
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:12,939
achievement that he made in China was

623
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,850
definitely in crop breeding and

624
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,769
improvements so to my understanding or

625
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:23,839
my story we'll talk about his work in

626
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:26,629
China just by two parts one part of his

627
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,730
contribution is that he Institute

628
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,890
instituting the Cornell Nanking story

629
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,269
that we just mentioned a later I will

630
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,540
give you more background information on

631
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:38,179
this story the other part of his

632
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:40,428
achievements is that he did some

633
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:43,910
personal trial on Plum breeding

634
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:48,380
experiment and also God's success in

635
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:50,779
that period very meaningful thing very

636
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,760
early just upon his arrival in 1914 he

637
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:54,220
just started to to do something on

638
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:56,200
prompt reading

639
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,929
he might be the first person to plot to

640
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,519
treat you have brought the modern

641
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:06,429
technology of plant breeding to China

642
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:09,250
and to use that okay those are something

643
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:12,519
from his oral history actually from here

644
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:17,230
we know that he did run breeding mainly

645
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:20,528
on two crops one is on wheat and the

646
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,889
other one is on corn or maize all right

647
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:26,349
so he said he developed the first pure

648
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:29,859
string of wheat from a single plant and

649
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:32,500
had a very good yield and that variety

650
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:35,199
was used as a Czech variety for a period

651
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,349
of time and for the corn he also

652
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,470
developed a Chinese yellow corn from

653
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:44,378
selections and that corn also was proved

654
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:49,000
to be very successful in some parts of

655
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:51,158
China let's look at the wheat first the

656
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,278
wheat actually to Chinese literature

657
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:58,330
that weed was named as a number 26

658
00:32:54,278 --> 00:33:01,990
developed by Reissner and here is a

659
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:03,939
table from a report of Meijer my

660
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,069
instructor Myers was also one of the

661
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,080
participants in Canal Nanking story

662
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:10,509
he worked in China for set a for a

663
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,878
period of time before he left he just

664
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:15,970
submitted a report on his work in China

665
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:18,398
in that report we can see this table you

666
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,350
can see that here the standard variety

667
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,439
is number six number six he used as of

668
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:25,990
standard variety and it had it has got a

669
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,929
better yield than those average farm

670
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:33,929
varieties in in terms of the corn the

671
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:38,559
corn that he developed was named as a

672
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:41,240
Nanking yellow keep him at this corn by

673
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,490
year to row method

674
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,160
that was a actually this method was

675
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,349
already commonly used in American

676
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,340
experiment stations but the first time

677
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:55,339
to be used in China and it was proved to

678
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:58,789
be very very successful especially in

679
00:33:55,339 --> 00:34:01,579
the area of Yangtze River so from those

680
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:04,220
successful experience Reisner has got

681
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:05,179
more confidence in doing plant breeding

682
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,240
in China

683
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,190
he said increased agricultural

684
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,829
production China will come most easily

685
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:17,809
and quickly through increasing yield by

686
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:19,549
scientific ground selection ok those are

687
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:21,799
the those are some of his personal

688
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,390
trials in from breeding and the second

689
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,250
part of his contribution is about the

690
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,869
colony linking story I would like to

691
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,239
give you some background stories about

692
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:33,139
this one so actually the canal linking

693
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,389
story started because a theorist family

694
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,379
in the White River that's central China

695
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:45,309
by River in 1920 the in President Wilson

696
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:49,340
set up a committee by responding to to

697
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:51,679
responded to that famine serious serious

698
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,960
famine by setting up a committee to

699
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,739
raise a big sum of money to do the

700
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:00,380
family relief work but later that relief

701
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:02,869
work ended sooner or earlier than

702
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,430
expected the committee found out you

703
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:07,699
still have a very big sum of money not

704
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:11,299
used how could they use this money in a

705
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:16,489
very wise way very wide way or very

706
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:18,980
effective way then Reisner just at that

707
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:21,889
time got to the news god got to know the

708
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,130
news and he submitted a proposal to that

709
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:28,819
committee saying that this money could

710
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,920
be used in a long run fanning prevention

711
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,980
instead of a short-run famine relief

712
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,590
work especially that could be used in

713
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,590
agriculture then that proposal was

714
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:43,059
approved the college of agriculture got

715
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,309
seven hundred fifty thousand dollars

716
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:48,529
that's really a very big sum of money

717
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:50,119
then that's why the Cornell Nanking

718
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,579
story happened

719
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,440
but the next for next step for Reisner

720
00:35:52,579 --> 00:36:00,859
to do is to design a concrete scheme or

721
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,659
design what really he needs to do with

722
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,308
that money

723
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:07,909
then he designed a very comprehensive

724
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:09,890
project especially in the field of

725
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:12,469
reading because we mentioned he has got

726
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:14,808
a lot of confidence in from reading then

727
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:19,038
he choose from reading as a main work of

728
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:22,028
the design project he then in 1924 he

729
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:25,039
wrote to dr. love at from reading here

730
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:27,829
to discuss on the possibility to invite

731
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:31,700
some American experts to come to China

732
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:35,240
to work and cooperate on from reading so

733
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:37,788
in brief that project finally involved

734
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:41,028
three experts from Konya plunk reading

735
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:43,849
they just went to China in turn each one

736
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:45,528
being there for for one year but each

737
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:49,670
one of them just went to China twice

738
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:52,489
each time one year there they did a lot

739
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,889
of things in China they taught lessons

740
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:57,078
they taught you know gave lectures they

741
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:58,818
instructed the experiment they helped

742
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,559
with the extension work they did a lot

743
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:04,068
of things you can see that you know

744
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,380
actually it's a kind of transferring off

745
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:08,929
the land ground mode land-grant college

746
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,160
mode from Cornell to to University of

747
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:14,179
Nanking especially the College of

748
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:17,088
Agriculture there so just because it's a

749
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:19,759
very comprehensive project the result

750
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:22,518
achieved from the project is also very

751
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:25,998
comprehensive the less people were

752
00:37:22,518 --> 00:37:29,118
trained the high yield crops were

753
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:31,969
achieved and the method was standardized

754
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,239
a lot of achievements what were got from

755
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:38,209
that very successful Cornell Nanking

756
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,548
story projects and one more thing about

757
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,599
this project I mean the long lasting

758
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:47,268
effect of that project is that it was

759
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,519
commonly considered as a first notable

760
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:53,328
example of international technical

761
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:56,209
cooperation in agriculture so that's why

762
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:59,720
it's also related to the recommendation

763
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:02,179
for President Truman for US government's

764
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,049
Honfleur program that's a technical

765
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:07,199
cooperation program

766
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,970
and also with this with the success of

767
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,309
the Cornell Nanking story there is a

768
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:17,129
following success of the Cornell Law

769
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:19,519
Spanier story all right some comment

770
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,200
from you know the other people on

771
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,400
reissner's work and contributing China

772
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,149
this guy

773
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,670
this person is dr. Zhang Zhang Han he is

774
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:33,030
a very outstanding plant breeder in

775
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,950
China's agricultural history especially

776
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,740
in the period of the Republic in China

777
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:41,029
but he went to Taiwan you know during

778
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:43,829
the time of committing communist China

779
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,330
he did a lot of contribution not only to

780
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:48,059
China's agriculture but also to

781
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:50,250
agriculture of Southeast Asia he was a

782
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:55,250
student of dr. earth he was also

783
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:58,739
Canadian graduate he was in the year of

784
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:01,559
1935 he once made a speech talking about

785
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:04,559
the development of China's plum greeting

786
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:09,989
creole he made a reflection that China's

787
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:12,469
plant breeding started from 1915 the

788
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:16,289
first 10 years was just like so a

789
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:20,669
person's childhood and in the year of

790
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:24,300
1925 it was transferred or transited to

791
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:28,019
a kind of person's childhood I'm sorry a

792
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,820
teenager teenager years ok the first 10

793
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:33,079
years and second 10 years different

794
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:36,390
period and you can see from the timing

795
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,549
the starting the ORAC the origin of

796
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:41,789
China's plunk reading actually it's

797
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:44,010
about a time while Weiser just arrived

798
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,969
in China and started his trial in plum

799
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:51,770
breeding and your transition year is

800
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:54,419
also the time Weisner started and

801
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:56,969
instituted that well knowing Cornell

802
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,818
Nanking story project

803
00:39:56,969 --> 00:40:03,088
so both stages are very closely related

804
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:05,969
to this guy and the doctor should also

805
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:08,009
named several representative persons for

806
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:11,449
the two stages of Chinese you know

807
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:14,790
starting years of plum reading and

808
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:18,649
Reisner was named respectively for the

809
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:21,380
two stages okay

810
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:26,369
finally some epilogue for my talk today

811
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:28,500
I although I focus on Reisman's

812
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:31,140
contribution to Chinese agriculture to

813
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,059
Chinese plum breeding but we should

814
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,509
always remember that it's never a

815
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:38,699
one-way traffic it's always a wing wing

816
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,319
project only in this way can such kind

817
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:44,279
of cooperation be very successful and

818
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:47,429
sustainable for example canal staff and

819
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,410
students may get a very global vision

820
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:54,269
from such kind of experience they may

821
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:58,559
yeah they may have more knowledge of the

822
00:40:54,269 --> 00:41:02,818
situation different areas of on the word

823
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:05,670
and besides that they also can have some

824
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:08,579
valuable plant resources and in history

825
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,700
from such kind of cooperation one very

826
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:14,609
good example is about dr. love and he's

827
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:17,009
one party story which was also told in

828
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:20,489
doctor loves book the corny on Nanking

829
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:23,310
story okay in brief the one party is a

830
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:26,969
party variety brought by talk to love

831
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:29,130
from China to to America he used that in

832
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:31,949
plant breeding experiment and later that

833
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:35,519
that variety was used for extension and

834
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:40,259
got a very big profit for New York wheat

835
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,670
industry and the variety was named as

836
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,940
war marriages because a Chinese

837
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,599
assistant working with Whistler while he

838
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,210
was in China

839
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,420
oh the person who firstly saw that

840
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:53,369
variety his name his last name was one

841
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,030
so that was why it was named as one

842
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,710
party all right since you know it's

843
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,519
always the kind of mutually beneficial

844
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,190
project so

845
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,250
even nowadays I still think they were

846
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,650
much it's much easier or there are more

847
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,559
opportunities than before to make such

848
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:16,039
kind of wing wing project happen in

849
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,559
current time or in the future maybe even

850
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:20,119
not only maybe not only just beneficial

851
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,880
to the two parties of the cooperation

852
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:25,730
but even beneficial to the global

853
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,340
agriculture so if you have not visited

854
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,619
China if you have not worked with

855
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:34,579
Nanjing Agricultural University come on

856

very much I would like to thank this

863
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:57,470
persons and some of the institutions who

864
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,420
just helped me with my study one year

865
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:23,618
study here and if you have any questions

866
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:23,619
just unvaried glad to to answer that I

867
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:30,050
think language Berry is always a problem

868
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:32,690
but that's not the biggest problem

869
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,930
those those American people they want to

870
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:39,320
China they I I don't I don't think they

871
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:41,659
learn much Chinese but Chinese people

872
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,309
maybe they mostly the Chinese people

873
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:45,710
just help to translate or they speak

874
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:47,960
they spoke China English very well so

875
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,269
that we can just work together with with

876
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,670
those American people there nowadays I

877
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:55,219
think things are much better now Chinese

878
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,570
people may be speak I think that if more

879
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,939
and more Chinese people speak better

880
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,690
English so if you want to go there don't

881
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,690
worry about language

882
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:28,830
[Music]

892
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,900
different kind of a pers about this

893
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,500
person and from those papers we can find

894
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,510
very interesting stories while those

895
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,940
student just came in and how they

896
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,970
settled down how they got used to the

897
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,329
culture here and a very interesting

898
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:11,939
things that also who she's mother there

899
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:14,279
also intellectual China she wrote a

900
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,619
letter to the American lady to show her

901
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,190
appreciation of course in Chinese and

902
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,750
who should translate it that being very

903
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,260
very good English

904
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,880
I really admire his English actually

905
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,130
just like the English people wrote wrote

906
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,650
that letter I think after a few years

907
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:51,750
here who sure just got used to I mean

908
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:55,019
the culture and yes that's good question

909
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:58,530
during that period most of the college

910
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:01,469
students were moved they have to move to

911
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:04,350
the southwest of China so actually

912
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:07,079
during I mean within the history of our

913
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:09,329
university there was one part that the

914
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,269
university was based in another province

915
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:14,369
in china but there was still some

916
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:17,219
foreigners they stayed in there because

917
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:19,259
a sitting Nanjing because you know they

918
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:20,699
are American people they're foreigners

919
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,950
they were a little bit different from

920
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:23,730
the Chinese people the Japanese invaders

921
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:25,230
they

922
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,320
they maybe they are not you know to

923
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:32,789
anything easily on them so they were I

924
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:36,300
remember there was one American people

925
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:38,039
his name's riggers and he actually is

926
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,769
the England field of agricultural

927
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:44,070
engineering he also got some was

928
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:45,509
founding a sponsor from Cornell in China

929
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,609
club because at that time there was a

930
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,800
kind organization named Cornell in China

931
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:51,619
Club the club is just to promote a

932
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,260
communication between Korea and China

933
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:58,200
the club just offered some funding to to

934
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:01,590
that American people to do some teaching

935
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:04,980
and research in China he was a very

936
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:07,890
important important person to work in a

937
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,679
kind of safe zone to protect a lot of

938
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:14,009
Chinese people who left and didn't

939
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:17,210
leaving but it we didn't run away in

940
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,630
Nanjing at that time that's very

941
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,909
interesting

942
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,910
touching story thank you for question

943
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:26,629
[Music]

944
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,319
yes you might be interesting that okay

945
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,699
that's very interesting story during the

946
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,850
Cultural Revolution

947
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:41,730
you know the Chairman Mao at that time

948
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:43,589
he thought that the Agricultural

949
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:46,289
University they should go to the rural

950
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:48,960
area so that they can be very close to

951
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:51,300
agriculture then those agricultural

952
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,710
universities all of them just moved to

953
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,650
very rather remote or rural area there

954
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:02,159
is small country or something like that

955
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:05,579
I should say the research the teaching

956
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,250
were actually interrupted because of you

957
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:11,340
know you know that at that time most of

958
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:14,250
the you know there was always a kind of

959
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,720
chaos in the society so the student

960
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,369
teachers they cannot you know have a

961
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,159
very good environment to study and do

962
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:22,800
research so yeah they were moved out of

963
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,319
the city but after the Revolution a

964
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,390
cultural evolution most of them all of

965
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,160
them just came back yeah

966
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:31,829
Oh in my university was also moved to a

967
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:35,909
very small city not far from the Nanjing

968
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:38,449
but in 1981 it was moved back to the

969
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,449
city of Nanjing

970
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:46,268
any questions

971
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:50,409

972
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:53,198
people in this world yes

973
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:57,039
oh that's great yes much more than my

974
00:48:53,199 --> 00:49:02,829
expectation okay so what about the rest
