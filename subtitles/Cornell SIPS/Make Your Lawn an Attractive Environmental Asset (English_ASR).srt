hi I'm Frank Rossi I'm a professor in

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,589
the Department of Horticulture here at

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,809
Cornell University and I get a lot of

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,519
questions from the general public and

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,198
even from golf course superintendents

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,179
and other people who really spend a fair

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,580
amount of time thinking about grass can

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,050
I have a really good lon but I really

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,329
care that I don't damage the environment

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,699
I want to be able to have a lawn that

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,929
takes me less time I don't want to be

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,670
able to have to spend the time they

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,340
spend at Yankee Stadium in center field

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,170
but I want it to look like that well the

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,359
fact is it's a lot easier than you might

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,789
think and it's a simple matter of making

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,759
sure your mo right what does that mean

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,799
keep the blade sharp make sure you're

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,049
mowing at a correct height so the grass

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,578
can grow long and grow healthy and of

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,738
course the longer the rest blades grow

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,620
the deeper the roots grow the less stuff

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,019
you have to put on leave the clippings

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,609
on don't take them away what you want to

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,289
do is return the nutrients and you

26
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,960
shouldn't have much problem having a

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,129
really high-quality lon and protecting

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,129
the environment at the same time
