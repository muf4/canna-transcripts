1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,958
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,638
University well thank you very much Tim

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,400
and um thank you for the invitation to

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,278
Cornell it's great to be here and it

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
I've met some really Fascinating People

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:21,480
this morning including the parking

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Warden

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,719
um so what I want to talk about is plant

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,599
fin typing but first I thought I don't

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,160
want to I don't want this to be the

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,439
departmental seminar commercial break

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,359
but I will talk about the Genesis of the

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,479
company Cubit systems it's an acronym

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,359
Cubit for Queens University biological

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,119
instrumentation and technology and the

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,238
founder members of myself that's me when

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:49,439
I had more her uh Nick Dowling was um

18
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:54,640
working in the lab with me and the lab

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,079
was uh run by David LEL who um as as Tim

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,359
just alluded to we were doing a lot of

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,198
work with with nitrogen fixation and the

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,239
um the oxy diffusion barrier in

23
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,158
particular non-invasive measurements of

24
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,438
nitrogenase activity and the company was

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,400
we we were helped to start up by partek

26
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,599
Innovations which is the Queens

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,240
University technological transfer

28
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:21,239
arm the first thing um that we developed

29
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,599
as part of our Research into plant

30
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,438
physiology was a differential oxygen

31
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,640
analyzer now in the Plant World

32
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:33,359
measuring photosynthesis and

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,719
respiration um small small tissues the

34
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,799
it's it's difficult to get measurements

35
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,959
of of metabolic rate and photosynthetic

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,920
rate um using oxygen as the as the

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,599
measure of activity um that's why we

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,359
measure typically photosynthetic uptake

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,718
uh as CO2 uptake rather than oxygen

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,159
release the reason for this is that the

41
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:57,438
atmosphere is about 350 po per million

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,159
CO2 and rising and um typically you put

43
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,639
a leaf in a leaf chamber you measure the

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,600
input CO2 to the output CO2 measure the

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,759
difference between the input out to

46
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,439
Output multiply by flow rate and that

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,919
gives you a rate sometimes you look at

48
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,400
an uptake of about 10 parts per million

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,878
against a background of 350 part per

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,239
million very easy to measure with a an

51
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:23,399
IR CO2 analyzer oxygen much much more

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,039
difficult the background is 210,000 part

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,280
per million but you're still only

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,199
exchanging 10 PPM measuring 10 PPM

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,239
against 210,000

56
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,399
very very difficult but we developed

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,920
this instrument which resolves one PPM

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,280
oxygen against air and people were quite

59
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,238
excited by it so park said patent it

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,439
let's form a company that's where

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,560
essentially cubic came from um the

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,560
instrument is very very stable you can

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,840
see here measurements of oxygen and CO2

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
looking at the respiration rate of a

65
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,800
potato now not very exciting thing to do

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
measuring potato respiration rate but

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,080
what it does illustrate is how stable

68
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,840
the signals are and that the respiratory

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,000
quotient of your potato is one it's

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,200
metabolizing pure carbohydrate right

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
more interesting though is to use this

72
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:22,158
device to look at flux of electrons in

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,639
our potato if we are metabolizing pure

74
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,959
carbohydrate and all the electrons going

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,719
through glycolysis in the CB cycle end

76
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,400
up um in the electron transport chain we

77
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,280
form water we get one CO2 produced for

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,719
every oxygen consumed so you got a

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,519
respiratory quo to one but if these

80
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,840
electrons are going somewhere else if

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,039
they're being dragged off to other sinks

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,080
then that respiratory quo changes so now

83
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,919
we can look at the fate of electrons if

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,719
we measure oxygen and CO2 at the same

85
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,919
time similarly with

86
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,759
photosynthesis if the light reactions if

87
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,039
all of the uh electrons generated in the

88
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:07,120
light reactions end up reducing carbon

89
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,078
dioxide to carbohydrate we get one

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,719
oxygen produced for every CO2 that is

91
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,959
fixed however if these reactions are

92
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,478
pulled off to do other things like

93
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,519
nitrate assimilation in the leaf and

94
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,439
what have you the ratio changes so by

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,639
measuring oxygen and CO2 at the same

96
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,000
time we have a synergistic measurement

97
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
of photosynthesis in which we can look

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,879
in changing conditions perhaps at where

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,240
the electrons are going we actually

100
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,038
developed an acronym which was Flux Of

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,840
reductant to Alternative sources and

102
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,159
sinks but we discovered that the

103
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,638
accident that the acronym spelled fras

104
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,039
and at the time we didn't understand

105
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,639
that fras was actually caterpillar Shir

106
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:55,319
and um therefore we dropped that one and

107
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,600
we uh we started to call it Dr which is

108
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,038
diverted reductant utilization rate

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,320
which nobody uses anyway so but we did

110
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
some uh interesting measurements one of

111
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,120
I thought I'd pull this one up it's kind

112
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,560
of cool we were trying to determine

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,038
whether or not the um the reductant

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,600
generated in the light in soybean pods

115
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,240
was actually used for fatty acid

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,000
metabolism and this was kind of

117
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,478
interesting so we looked at oxygen

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,759
exchange rate in the dark and CO2

119
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,879
exchange rate in the dark and there's a

120
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:30,038
net flux of CO2 out of the nodules in

121
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:32,680
the dark as and a net uptake of oxygen

122
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,599
and we turn the light on the fixation of

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,199
CO2 was not enough to create a net

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,160
uptake of CO2 but the photosynthetic

125
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,038
reactions were enough to have a net um

126
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,479
production of oxygen so in fact in this

127
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:52,120
circumstance we had a tissue which is

128
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,639
producing both oxygen and and CO2 at the

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,319
same time they both being evolved and as

130
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,439
far as we know that's the first time any

131
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,000
anybody's ever measured net flux of

132
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,600
oxygen and CO2 in the same direction at

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,199
the same time and the I won't go into

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
the details of the paper but we did

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,879
discover that yes the uh uh the

136
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,839
reductant generated by the Light

137
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,079
reactions of photosynthesis is involved

138
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,959
in fatty acid synthesis in the in the

139
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,879
nodule uh another thing we use the um

140
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,399
differential oxygen analyzer for was a

141
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,519
work with Steve long at the University

142
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,038
of Illinois and he was interested in the

143
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,038
question does elevated CO2 concentration

144
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,279
decreased dark respiration in soyan and

145
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,360
this has been a matter of contention for

146
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,879
some time that high CO2 you know this is

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,120
a case with global warming it's going to

148
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,279
be an issue if it affects D respiration

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,199
then you have to put this into your

150
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,959
models but there's some question of if

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,240
it does how does it do it and so we did

152
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:47,439
some measurements with a a Lor CO2

153
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,680
analyzer and yes at high CO2 levels

154
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,120
there was a reduction in Dart

155
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,879
respiration apparent reduction but what

156
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,439
if we measured this respiration rate

157
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,120
using oxygen uptake

158
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,199
instead we don't see a change um and we

159
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,598
came to the conclusion and as of others

160
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
since then that these small changes

161
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,560
actually in the resolution and the

162
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,399
linearity of these CO2 analyzers at high

163
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,959
CO2 have been creating an erroneous

164
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,839
measurement of Dart respiration so in

165
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,560
fact we came to the conclusion that it

166
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,598
doesn't that Dart respiration is not

167
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,759
affected at least at the the levels of

168
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,759
CO2 that that we

169
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,719
investigated um I thought the world

170
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,759
would be beating our door beating path

171
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,960
to our doors about the everybody here

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
should be now very excited about buying

173
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,038
one of these differential auction

174
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,719
analyzers uh in fact um yeah it it there

175
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,959
was a less enthusiastic response at

176
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,280
least from the plant scientists the

177
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,598
animal scientists love them uh so we

178
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,279
needed to make money and at the time I

179
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:50,279
was teaching bio 101 I had a thousand

180
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,158
students in my uh 101 class as Tony

181
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:56,119
would know he wasn't one of them else he

182
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:56,120
wouldn't be here now and

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,918
um the problem was that the kids were

184
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,079
given well they weren't given Lor and

185
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,719
things like this they were they

186
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,639
surrounded the one Lor in the department

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,879
and told not to touch it was a black box

188
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,319
with spat out numbers when they

189
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,680
measuring photosynthesis lousy for

190
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,598
teaching I thought there's got to be a

191
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,439
better way got to be a better way so we

192
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:20,319
developed some very lowcost instruments

193
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,560
for measuring carbon dioxide and oxygen

194
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,919
um that could be uh deployed in the lab

195
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,839
really really inexpensively using

196
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,839
inexpensive software we got from a

197
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,519
company in Portland Oregon which I'll

198
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,120
get to in a moment so and we've

199
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,199
developed this over the years so now we

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,399
have this what we call the qbx concept

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,599
where we have a pump a flow meter a CO2

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,559
analyzer an analyzer for measuring

203
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,080
relative humidity humidity and

204
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,199
temperature they're all modular but they

205
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,160
all fit into the box and um they're

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,920
inexpensive enough so that teaching Labs

207
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,600
can afford these and if anything ever

208
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,278
goes wrong with any of the components

209
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,920
one of the great things is you just

210
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,759
phone as we send you a replacement

211
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,240
component and these things kind of slot

212
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,319
out you put it in and you're ready to go

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,480
again within 48 Hours unlike the single

214
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,680
units from likeo 40 odd ,000 if the pump

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
goes you have to send the whole thing

216
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,120
back like or great I'm not denigrating

217
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,440
them they're wonderful instruments um we

218
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,360
think these are wonderful as well and

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
they''re used now extensively in both

220
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,399
research and teaching there's a

221
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,639
fantastic company called verer software

222
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
and Portland Oregon which which develops

223
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,958
the interface and the software for these

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,839
things we can get to eight analog

225
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,799
inputs the the manipulation the data

226
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
manipulation the software is great

227
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,120
wonderful graphical displays this is a

228
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,000
light response of photosynthesis you can

229
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,078
see the changes in the actinic light the

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,919
corresponding changes in CO2 the changes

231
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:50,519
in stomatal movement me measured as

232
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,159
relative humidity and then in different

233
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,320
um different pages within the software

234
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,319
we calculate things like stomatal

235
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,440
conductance internal CO2 Etc really

236
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,240
really really nice in

237
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,480
instruments end of commercial break um

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,039
what I want to talk about for the bulk

239
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:15,480
of this uh presentation is plant

240
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,799
phenotyping and um here Cubit systems

241
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,120
has formed a very very close association

242
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,120
with a company in the Czech Republic uh

243
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,120
called Photon systems instruments and

244
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,320
this company were the first company to

245
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,679
commercialize an Imaging system uh for

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,519
chlorophyll fluoresence kinetics and I

247
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,479
will talk a little bit about chlorophyll

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,799
fluoresence kinetics bit more detail

249
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:45,000
about that um later on in the seminar um

250
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:48,359
now then why has there been this

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
apparently sudden massive interest in

252
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,519
plant phenotyping systems the big a ag

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,120
biotech companies are are all looking to

254
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,679
get these there's there establishments

255
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,039
throughout the world who are really

256
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:03,879
really keen on on high throughput

257
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,719
phenotyping and trait Discovery well

258
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,720
this is a kind of depressing slide now

259
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,800
the next several slides these are taken

260
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,879
from a talk given by Eric

261
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,879
merie um at a workshop I was at in

262
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,078
Thailand two weeks ago he was kind

263
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,799
enough to send me these slides yesterday

264
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,599
so I've stuck them in my talk and I give

265
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,958
him full credit for them although the

266
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,040
work done is by other people who are who

267
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,078
are credited here and he was making the

268
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,639
point that we are in a extremely

269
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,000
difficult situation with respect to

270
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:39,879
feeding the world in 2050 this is the

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,480
increase in yield of various crops from

272
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:47,720
1961 to 2008 you see this linear

273
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,920
increase here this is the yield

274
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,200
requirement these dotted lines of each

275
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,360
of these crops based on population in

276
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,160
the year

277
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,720
2050 this here is the projected increase

278
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:04,360
in yield if we continue along these

279
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,278
lines which we've been going on so far

280
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,759
the result of this is that the land area

281
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,000
we would need to extend for each of

282
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:19,198
these crops to get the yield that we

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,399
require is quite enormous quite enormous

284
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,559
so there's a a going to be a significant

285
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,559
problem about feeding

286
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,838
people um I can't tell you a great deal

287
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,359
about this slide that said that it's

288
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,639
very depressing I haven't read I must

289
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,720
admit this paper I didn't have time but

290
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,720
the take home message from it is that

291
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,040
without adaptation to climate change

292
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,639
particularly to increase in temperature

293
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,120
the yields that we're looking at right

294
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,560
now the yields that have been increasing

295
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,639
are actually going to decline 17 to

296
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,278
15% um over this period it's it's a very

297
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,799
very significant

298
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:58,519
problem but the news is not all bad the

299
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,679
good news is again this is a paper by

300
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,919
Zoo

301
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,799
2008 but if you look at solar energy

302
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,519
what comes in what is potentially there

303
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,479
for the plant to use if you look at the

304
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,679
total amount of solar

305
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,278
energy you get a thousand say kles of

306
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,879
energy not absorbed by the chlorophyll

307
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:21,320
513 reflected or transmitted 49

308
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:25,159
inefficiencies within photochemistry is

309
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:29,480
about 66 which leaves us with about

310
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:33,000
372 K of energy then we have C3 plants

311
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,959
and C4 plants C4 plants use more in

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,078
carbohydrate synthesis than do C3 plants

313
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:41,719
so the result we've got 85 left compared

314
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:45,159
to 128 however the C4 plants don't F to

315
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,160
respire whereas the C3 plants do so now

316
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,480
the C4 plants are ahead with 85 and then

317
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:55,240
we have respiratory processes which

318
00:13:50,480 --> 00:14:02,039
bring the total energy to 60

319
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:04,720
k for the C4s and 40 6 k for the c3s

320
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,719
this is the potential energy that could

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:13,680
be captured turned into biomass if you

322
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:17,199
like in reality only one to 2% of this

323
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,479
is realized which means that we have

324
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:23,958
scope for

325
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,519
increasing this energy uh conversion and

326
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,958
and and and and and capture um the

327
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,959
question is how do we do it so we need

328
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,719
to be looking at the various traits of

329
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:39,319
plants what is causing why are they so

330
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,959
inefficient and how can we put in some

331
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,440
amelioration um some of the reasons

332
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,479
there's poor absorption of light there's

333
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,720
forer protection mechanisms which kind

334
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,600
of uh get rid of the the light energy

335
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,720
which may be absorbed to protect the

336
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,240
thids the statal closure plants will

337
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
light saturate when perhaps they we

338
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,039
could change them so that light

339
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,120
saturation point would be higher there's

340
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,480
all issues to do with source and sink

341
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,120
relationship feedback against fotenes

342
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,560
this star accumulation all of these

343
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,198
things can reduce the potential gain of

344
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:19,278
energy by the plant there's a lot of

345
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,278
targets that are are that we can aim

346
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,278
at and you know looking at the light

347
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,839
response for photosynthesis and we can

348
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,360
see that here we're in the light limited

349
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
range then we're in the light such at

350
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
range we could perhaps push this up

351
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,759
higher and then we have problems with

352
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,639
excess light energy where we get photo

353
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,519
inhibition added to this if the plants

354
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,799
are stressed with abiotic stresses or

355
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
biotic stresses where High lights low

356
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:49,439
high temperature etc etc low water

357
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,838
availability uh pathogen infection it

358
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,240
pushes the whole thing down so we need

359
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,800
to find out what these traits are we

360
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,639
need to be able to screen lots of plants

361
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,120
and to pick out the traits of

362
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,879
interest and to do this um Cubit systems

363
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,959
Photon systems in the cze Republic some

364
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,519
other companies I won't mention um have

365
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,239
Divine de designed and developed

366
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,000
instrumentation for screening large

367
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,560
amounts of large numbers of genetically

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,360
modified plants different lines and to

369
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,958
be able to detect as rapidly as possible

370
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,519
those plants with with potentially

371
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,958
beneficial traits so we're looking for

372
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,879
high throughput solution I mean ideally

373
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,039
you'd want to measure meure thousands of

374
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,919
plants all at the same time of day and

375
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,439
you'd want to measurement photosynthesis

376
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,120
transpiration etc etc etc you can't do

377
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,399
that with conventional CO2 analyzers

378
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,959
oxygen analyzers you need proxies and

379
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,839
most of these proxies are Optical and

380
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,879
that's what I'd like to talk about now

381
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:55,560
in the uh in the bulk of the seminar so

382
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,838
we have developed a series of

383
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,278
phenotyping instruments which we call

384
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
the the plant screen

385
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,519
um uh series and they have they're

386
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,038
different designs but they have similar

387
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,400
components so in this particular system

388
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,160
it's a conveyor based system we have an

389
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,360
external conveyor belt which feed plants

390
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:19,240
into a cabinet the cabinet is light

391
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,479
acclimated it has LEDs above there's

392
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,558
automatic watering and weighing the

393
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,759
plants go in trays or pots they move

394
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,160
through they're light adapted or dark

395
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,679
adapted they're they can be watered and

396
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,000
weighed to with specific protocols for

397
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,320
Drought or water sufficiency even water

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,839
logging and then we look at the effect

399
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,759
of any treatments we do via thermal

400
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,519
imaging hyperspectral Imaging chlorophyl

401
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,519
florescence Imaging and all for

402
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,400
morphometric and and and color

403
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,000
analysis um I won't bother with there's

404
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,519
numbers of these things now installed

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,079
throughout the world um they come in

406
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,480
various sizes this one has been

407
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,839
developed for Pioneer for screening very

408
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,960
very tall maze plants this is at the

409
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:05,639
University of OLS um different picture

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,319
the same thing this is a close-up of the

411
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,200
system at the University of alets and if

412
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,200
this works which I hope it

413
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,519
will it will show us a

414
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,279
video uh speed it up of the plants

415
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,519
coming from the external conveyor into

416
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,038
the cabinet this is going about um four

417
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,519
or five times faster than the plants

418
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,079
would would would normally move um they

419
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:36,038
move through the conveyor

420
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:38,399
system to the uh Imaging stations this

421
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,079
is for measuring RGB and chlorophyll

422
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,600
fluorescence kinetics of which I'll talk

423
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,240
about more about later um and then

424
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,439
there's thermal imaging and there's

425
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,880
hyperspectral Imaging everything is is

426
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,558
controlled under very strict

427
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,080
environmental conditions so that the

428
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,519
light incident on the plants is

429
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,759
homogeneous there is automatic weighing

430
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,558
of the plants with the plants you'll see

431
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,440
the plants lift they're on load cells

432
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,240
here five of the plants are weighed at

433
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,480
the same time and there's automatic

434
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,519
watering of the plants and you can

435
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,079
program the amount of water delivered to

436
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,639
each plant so that the weight doesn't

437
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,678
change with time for example or you can

438
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,440
reduce the weight so that you get a a

439
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,038
drought stressed environment or a water

440
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,960
logged environment we have students

441
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,759
working with us doing Masters and phds

442
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,720
this is one of them uh the whole system

443
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,640
runs offer graphical user interface

444
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,240
where you can put in protocols for the

445
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,280
various Imaging systems and um data

446
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
acquisition and you can also do all of

447
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,960
your your viewing of the data on these

448
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,519
uh

449
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:48,919
screens um we also have systems which

450
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,440
are in which the Imaging is taken to the

451
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,200
plants rather than the plants being

452
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,720
taken to the Imaging stations some

453
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,480
people argue that if you got a plant on

454
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,679
a conveyor bouncing around then you know

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,200
over time you're going to get some

456
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,679
environmental effects of vibration which

457
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,880
are going to skew your data uh in that

458
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,559
case you can actually take the Imaging

459
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,200
system to the plant but I would argue

460
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,519
that a plant being outside of the field

461
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,558
environment not moving at all again

462
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,279
there's going to be skewing of it its

463
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,720
architecture based on the fact that it

464
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,158
isn't being buffeted by the winds Etc

465
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
but we do offer these options and we

466
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,159
build these things in controlled

467
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
environment rooms which we call

468
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,519
they control the environment very very

469
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,480
specifically uh we also have field

470
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:40,599
phenotyping systems of different sorts

471
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,558
this is a Gantry system in which the um

472
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,119
phenotype in the Imaging array is built

473
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,839
on a Gantry like a almost like an

474
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,000
irrigation platform which moves across

475
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,119
the field it advances it can move up and

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,319
down for different heights of plant it

477
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,000
can do hyperspectral thermal chlorophyll

478
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,839
fluoresence RGB Imaging it's it's also

479
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,919
got sensors for CO2 light wind wind

480
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,279
temperature ambient sensors and um it

481
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,200
advances scans across a transa advances

482
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,798
again scans again generating terabytes

483
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,319
of data in the process uh this is a much

484
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,558
more modest system in which the user can

485
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,558
just drive the system in the or push the

486
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,839
system in the field the Imaging system

487
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,558
is here it moves up and down this is a

488
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,759
smaller version of this in which the

489
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,119
Imaging array moves across a small

490
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,480
transa and it can be Advanced so the

491
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,759
field systems have the same type of

492
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
capabilities as the growth room and the

493
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,480
greenhouse based systems we're also

494
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,159
doing crazy things um the the reason I

495
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,839
went to Thailand was to I didn't realize

496
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
there's a big problem with flooding of

497
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,678
rice it rice in Thailand can be

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,079
underwater for a significant period of

499
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,320
time and under very deep water so

500
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,079
apichart who's the director of the

501
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,720
research center there has developed

502
00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:01,079
these ponds where he's going to grow

503
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,278
rice uh under uh actually 5 m of

504
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,158
water and he wants to see what happens

505
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,000
phenotypically with time so we're

506
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,960
developing the system very much like the

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,159
field system there's rails that move

508
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,159
across the pond there's the Gantry here

509
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
the Imaging system is here it can be

510
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,600
moved up and down and can do the types

511
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,679
of measurements which I've um I've

512
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,000
already

513
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,278
discussed so what do you do I mean what

514
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,798
was the the operation of this thing well

515
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:28,919
first of all you have to tell the system

516
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,639
which plants you're studying so so if

517
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,360
you're using a conveyor based system

518
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,000
with pots in trays then you have a part

519
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,678
of the software which says whoops um

520
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,919
which says what are these plants where

521
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,919
are they within the tray or is the part

522
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,000
there are bar there are barcodes and

523
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,000
offit identification tabs and these are

524
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,919
collated against the map that you make

525
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,880
of the system in the tray register then

526
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
every time that pot or that tray moves

527
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,120
through the system or it might be a GPS

528
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,319
location in the field it Cates all the

529
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,839
data you've ever collected um uh for

530
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,879
that particular plant or pot um in the

531
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,079
database with that reference same thing

532
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,159
when you've got um trays on the conveyor

533
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,839
system the conveyor feeds into the

534
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,720
Imaging you can have lines which are

535
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:20,278
just sitting there and and under defined

536
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,519
environmental conditions uh for growth

537
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,440
you can have lines which are the

538
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,359
operation lines which are going to be

539
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,759
moving through the system and you can

540
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,439
randomize the plants on these lines so

541
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,798
that you're not always measuring plant

542
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,480
number one at noon and plant number 2

543
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,079
285 at 400 p.m. that would skew your

544
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,720
data as well so there are randomization

545
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,240
programs which allow you to move the

546
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,240
plants around uh in space and make sure

547
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,558
that you don't measure uh the same

548
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,278
plants at the same time all the time um

549
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,839
there's lots of automated experimental

550
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,880
protocols so that you can set up

551
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,000
lighting conditions preconditions

552
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
watering conditions and you say for

553
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,079
these given sets of plants over this

554
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,200
time do eight rounds through these

555
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:03,759
various Imaging stations and do these

556
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,240
particular measurements and those

557
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,679
measurements then all the data are

558
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,159
collated in the software the network is

559
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
we have the various Imaging stations

560
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
when you were're collecting huge amounts

561
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,200
of complex data like from chlorophyll

562
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,240
fluorescence or from hyperspectral they

563
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,640
have their individual PCS with their own

564
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,919
database which then transfers the data

565
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,120
to the main database for uh less complex

566
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,240
measurements such as RGB thermal and um

567
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,798
and color analysis the data goes

568
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,480
directly to the database uh the analysis

569
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,319
of the data can be done remotely from

570
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,240
any computer which has allowed access to

571
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,398
the central server so um you can have

572
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,839
numerous people working on the data at

573
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,319
any one time and it's really up to the

574
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,558
client to decide who gets the access and

575
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,158
how much access they get for both

576
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:57,519
control and for data manipulation and

577
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,480
you can recalculate data you can do lots

578
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,960
of wonderful things with the

579
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,640
software what do we use it for we look

580
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,880
for abiotic stresses biotic stresses

581
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,600
plant growth analysis trait Discovery as

582
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,039
I mentioned before nutrient stress

583
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:16,918
ecotoxicology and we do it in both the

584
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:19,398
uh the lab and the field so the various

585
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,159
stations that we have I'll just go

586
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:24,759
through them one by one RGB and

587
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,159
structural Imaging very straightforward

588
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,440
typically three cameras one above two at

589
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,880
the sides at 90°

590
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
uh that gives you uh rudimentary 3D

591
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
reconstruction it's better if you

592
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,360
actually rotate the plant on a stage

593
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,000
take multiple images from different

594
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,199
angles and then you can get a beautiful

595
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,640
3D reconstruction for your Mor

596
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,679
morphological studies then the software

597
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,240
will allow you to compute

598
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,919
numerous parameters morphological

599
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,919
parameters and you can plot spids to

600
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,000
show how different plants within a

601
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,159
population differ in terms of for

602
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,839
example the area the perimeter the

603
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,640
compactness the roundness ETC very easy

604
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,439
to compare them using these spidergrams

605
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559
then within individual plants you can

606
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,759
see how these parameters individual

607
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,440
parameters change over the course of

608
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:15,558
time when you're doing a a Time course

609
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,720
study looking at for example plant

610
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:23,798
architecture this is all automated data

611
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,440
um you can look this is a a water stress

612
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:28,679
experiment the data sorry the data are

613
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,120
plotted conventionally as why is it

614
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,200
doing that it's doing that because I'm

615
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,959
not pressing the laser pointer uh proed

616
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,399
conventionally on time course graphs as

617
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,319
well to see how for example the eara of

618
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,038
the plant declines as drought kicks in

619
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,678
against the controls and again we have

620
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,278
the

621
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,679
spidergrams

622
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:50,880
um we also have automated color analysis

623
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,038
because color changes with respect to uh

624
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,960
infection with chlorop content with

625
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,200
carotenoid content and you can Define

626
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,200
your color groups within the software as

627
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,080
many color groups as you want and the

628
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,360
software will automatically say at Time

629
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:10,319
Zero it had x% of sick green y% of

630
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,398
healthy green and z% of Z green of of of

631
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,119
of dark green and then with time it'll

632
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,439
show you how those greenness uh

633
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,918
indicators change AO

634
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,278
automatically

635
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,640
um we have a 3D scanning option as well

636
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:29,278
uh these three camera um things have

637
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,159
been criticized by some people that you

638
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,798
can get uh uh some artifacts due to the

639
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,278
plant moving as you're rotating on the

640
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,558
stage it might be uh more convenient to

641
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,319
have the plant move across the plant the

642
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:45,240
the camera move across the plant so that

643
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:46,558
you scan the plant this can be done

644
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,399
really really quickly and gives you

645
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,440
extremely fine resolution downside is it

646
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,278
costs a lot more a lot more to have a 3D

647
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,798
scanner than it does to have three

648
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:56,880
conventional cameras with a with a

649
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,359
rotating

650
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,640
stage we trct Leaf movement using this

651
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:06,319
RGB camera these are overlaid responsive

652
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,120
a rabid opsis leaf leaf movement this is

653
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,720
zooming in on one PL the uh other thing

654
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,678
we can do is the software will

655
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,720
automatically allow you to segregate

656
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,360
these into individual leaves so you can

657
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,600
track parameters Leaf by Leaf not just

658
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,599
plant by plant and you can plot all of

659
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,879
those parameters Leaf by

660
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
Leaf thermal imaging I've been talking

661
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,440
to a number of people this morning about

662
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,159
thermal imaging we use Fleer cameras to

663
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,038
do this typically um these slides are

664
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
fairly self-explanatory we look at the

665
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:39,759
temperature of the plants and the leaves

666
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,600
as the Tomato open um the leaf greater

667
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,158
of Vaper transpiration allows the leaf

668
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,519
to cool itself you get some plants which

669
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,120
like to take a risk they leave the

670
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,679
stomato open they cool themselves

671
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,398
they're allowing CO2 going in but

672
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,960
they're losing a lot of water other

673
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,558
plants are more conservative and they

674
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,519
say oh highlight close my stomato um

675
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,879
because I don't want to dry out but whoa

676
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,038
my photo synthesis has gone down now

677
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,600
therefore potentially I've got less

678
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,359
Shield it's a balancing act and some

679
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,599
plants are conservative some plants are

680
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,918
Risk Takers you can determine you can

681
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,240
see the difference between by looking at

682
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,240
the leaf temperature the static clows

683
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,120
the temperature goes up quite obviously

684
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,440
um we can see it also in osmotic stress

685
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,959
this is false color images of plants

686
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,278
which have been sub subjected to osmotic

687
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,679
stress here against control plants and

688
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:33,119
um you can see the temperature profile

689
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,000
changes very very quickly and very

690
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,278
obviously the stress versus the control

691
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,038
plants hyperspectral measurements I've

692
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,159
talked to a number of people in the

693
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,158
department this morning about

694
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,640
hyperspectral measurements essentially

695
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,679
you hit the leaf with a broad wavelength

696
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,519
of light a full spectrum of light say

697
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,600
from 400 to 2,500 nanometers depending

698
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,558
on the biochemical status of the leaf

699
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,918
it's going to absorb or reflect uh

700
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,918
different wavelengths and by measuring

701
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,080
those reflected wavelengths and applying

702
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,000
them to reflective indices these

703
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,918
calculations you can look at the

704
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,599
biochemical status with respect to

705
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,399
chlorophyll content carotenoid content

706
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,719
you can look at highlight stress through

707
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,479
measure of PRI you can look at water

708
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,038
content as well and these are just some

709
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,759
of the dozens of reflective indices that

710
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:23,558
are available in the literature and

711
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:29,119
people are discovering more and more of

712
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:31,759
these as as time goes on um ndvi is a

713
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,959
measurement which indicates chlorophyll

714
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,558
content um amongst other things this is

715
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,640
a study in which uh arabidopsis have

716
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,798
been subjected to different

717
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,399
concentrations of Roundup and you can

718
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:48,720
see it 2% Roundup after 50 hours very

719
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:51,398
very different ndvi as as shown on this

720
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,519
false color pallette compared to the the

721
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,158
control

722
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,159
values and these data are also plotted

723
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,519
here to see the change and I'm going to

724
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,200
point out the where the change occurs

725
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,919
temporally because I'll be coming back

726
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,240
to this slide later uh relative water

727
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,960
content using hyperspectral measurements

728
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,079
there are water absorbance bands are

729
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,000
about 1,400 1900 nanometers when the

730
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,119
plant is fully hydrated these bands are

731
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,599
very very deep as you put the plant

732
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,678
through a dehydration cycle they become

733
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,638
much more shallow um easy to

734
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,600
see easy to visualize a false color

735
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,038
palette showing fully hydrated plants

736
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,119
and blue the less blue there is the less

737
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:37,158
water there is you can see over a period

738
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,000
of a drying cycle the water uh changes

739
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,919
in water content are very very easy to

740
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,440
see and we're at a point now where we

741
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,840
can resolve about a 1% of fresh weight

742
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,720
change in water using these

743
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,879
hyperspectral

744
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,639
measurements thing I want to focus on is

745
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,080
chlorophyll florescence kinetic Imaging

746
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:56,479
and because I think we do well I know we

747
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,038
do this better than anybody else in the

748
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,360
world and in fact We Do It um with a

749
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:05,398
greater degree of um of precision and

750
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,918
resolution and we offer a lot more

751
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,678
parameters that one can measure which I

752
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,278
believe are the parameters that people

753
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,919
should be studying rather than the uh

754
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,558
parameter that most people study which

755
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,120
is dark adapted Quantum yield FB over FM

756
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,558
chlorophyll fluoresence I mean this is

757
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,518
an ancient experiment everybody does in

758
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,278
in bio11 you shine white light at a

759
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,759
suspension of chloroplast you see red

760
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,319
light because it's fluorescing at a

761
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:32,119
higher wavelength why and how does this

762
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:35,158
happen well this is your Zed scheme of

763
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,759
photosynthesis from plant physiology

764
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:42,399
301 you get the absorption of a photon

765
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:45,599
releases electrons from p680 these are

766
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,319
accepted by primary electron accepted QA

767
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,038
pass through the electron transport

768
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,599
chain to photos system one light

769
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,319
absorbed by p700 releases electrons

770
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:58,000
which are taken up by ferrodoxin

771
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:01,398
ferrodoxin is used to reduce nadph and

772
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,480
that is used to reduce CO2 all works

773
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:08,759
very beautifully wonderful um problem

774
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,000
occurs during stress when things go

775
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,440
south in here or along the electron

776
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,359
transport chain when when there are

777
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,000
problems when the stata close and

778
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:22,638
photosynthesis is limited it does not

779
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,759
stop absorption of Light by photosystem

780
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:27,519
too it does not stop the release of

781
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,839
these high energy electrons but the that

782
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,319
energy has got to go somewhere and it

783
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:37,359
can be dissipated as heat through what

784
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,359
we call non-photochemical quenching or

785
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,240
it can be dissipated as

786
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,439
fluoresence and it's fluoresence that we

787
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,759
measure to get an indication of the

788
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,240
degree of stress the onset the time of

789
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,638
on stress and the progression of stress

790
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,399
in the plant how do we do this

791
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:59,678
well we start off by putting the plant

792
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:02,638
in the dark and we give tiny tiny pulses

793
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,798
of Light which are non non actinic in

794
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:06,719
other words they don't they don't um

795
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:10,519
stimulate the dart reactions of

796
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,599
photosynthesis um and the plant under

797
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,960
those

798
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,240
circumstances all of the

799
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,559
electrons in the electron there's no

800
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,678
electrons attached to the electron

801
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,239
transport chain it's fully

802
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,519
oxidized then what we do is we give a

803
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,959
huge flash of light usually 5,000

804
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,519
micromoles of photons twice full

805
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,639
sunlight for about 08 seconds

806
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,358
this means that there's a huge flux of

807
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,280
electrons from here through this

808
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,239
electron transport chain but they've got

809
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,639
nowhere to go because these enzymes are

810
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,199
not operating which means that you get

811
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,519
maximum fluoresence yield you get this

812
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,158
peak of fluoresence here and when you do

813
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,639
a couple of calculations you get what

814
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,200
you call the quantum yield in the dark

815
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,838
adapted State this is FB over FM and

816
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,439
typically in a healthy plant that has a

817
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:57,759
conservative value of about

818
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,079
8.82 and as plants become stressed that

819
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,920
value declines and a lot of people use

820
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,400
this as the primary indicator of stress

821
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,200
which in my opinion is not a good idea

822
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,559
for reasons I'll get on to later what we

823
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,759
do what we do in our Imaging systems is

824
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:15,559
we push this further After the Dark adap

825
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,040
adaptation period we turn the light on

826
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:21,159
and we continue to image the chlorophyll

827
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:24,119
florescence kinetics what happens then

828
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:26,559
is that you get an initial peak of

829
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,880
fluorescence because the the

830
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,759
photosynthetic enzymes not active but as

831
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,519
you get activation of CO2 fixation this

832
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,320
fluorescence becomes less because of

833
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,920
course the electrons are now flowing

834
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,160
through the Zed scheme and uh you come

835
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
down then to a steady state fluoresence

836
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,838
by giving a saturating pulse at this

837
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,838
point you can look at what is called the

838
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,799
quantum yield of of

839
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:53,639
photosystem two in the light adapted

840
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,960
State how efficient is photosynthesis in

841
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,000
the light adapted State we measured a

842
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,519
whole pile of other par parameters

843
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
now having measured that light adapted

844
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,920
um Quantum yield if we know what the

845
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,440
photosynthetic Photon flux density if we

846
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,480
know how much light we're putting in

847
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,200
there in terms of micromoles of photons

848
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,358
we know that one Photon releases one

849
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,759
electron we can we know what the

850
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:19,000
proportion of light activating photos

851
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,720
system 2 versus photosystem one

852
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,519
typically 50/50 and we know the

853
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,399
proportion of Light which is absolutely

854
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,559
which is absorbed by the leaf typically

855
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,358
about 82% we can actually get

856
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:32,358
measurement of electron transport rate

857
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,719
it becomes an extremely good proxy for

858
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,920
photosynthetic rate you would have to

859
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,439
spend a lot of time measuring

860
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,800
photosynthetic rate on thousands of

861
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,519
plants by doing chlorophyll fluoresence

862
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,839
over a period of you know a few seconds

863
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,880
to a few minutes you can measure

864
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,759
thousands of plants simultaneously

865
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,880
almost and get very very good proxy for

866
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,640
photosynthetic rate this is a plot of

867
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,559
the photosynthetic rate measured by um

868
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:58,400
chlorophyll fluoresence against a

869
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,519
similation rate measured by uh more

870
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,160
conventional means very nice linear

871
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,599
relationship so there is a there is a

872
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,399
very good proxy we do this in our I

873
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,240
showed you the movie so you've seen the

874
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,639
LEDs given the light pulses and the

875
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,598
saturated flashes to measure the basic

876
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,279
parameters and then the calculated

877
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,318
parameters the great thing about the

878
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,680
Imaging is that not only can you see

879
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,279
these values these these these

880
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,199
fluorescent values um on an average

881
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,519
basis per plant and per Leaf you can

882
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,960
also see them pixel by pixel so if

883
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,199
you've got a disease which is spreading

884
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,920
through the leaf you can see the

885
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,480
progression the proportion of that leaf

886
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,079
which is being

887
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,599
diseased so uh why is this so nice if we

888
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,640
go back to our ndvi measurement here we

889
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,680
see that chlorophyll degradation when

890
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,118
you've treated it with Roundup before

891
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,960
you see anything takes about 13 hours if

892
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,880
you look at changes in morphology we're

893
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,039
looking at 20 hours before you see

894
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,079
anything measurable if we look at some

895
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,800
of the itic Imaging with chlorophyll

896
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
fluoresence we can see the effect

897
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,839
starting within 2 hours so if you're

898
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,760
really interested in when the onset of

899
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,480
stress occurs then this is a very Rapid

900
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,680
Way of seeing that and then if you want

901
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,639
to do amelioration effects you can start

902
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,000
putting in your ameliorations here and

903
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,719
seeing what how it's reversed you cannot

904
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,199
do that easily with these other

905
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:26,199
measurements um drought stress in turf

906
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:29,639
grass some work we did for Texas A&amp;M um

907
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:32,199
quickly f over FM over a 4-day period

908
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,838
without watering didn't change at all

909
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:38,719
8181 it was only after 7 days that we

910
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:40,599
saw a change whereas these other um

911
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,439
parameters like the fluorescence decline

912
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,400
ratio which I'll get on to in a moment

913
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,440
and non-photochemical quenching had

914
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,760
changed quite significantly by four days

915
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,318
you need to do this in the light adapted

916
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,200
State you can't just do the F over FM

917
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:57,000
measurement uh again here this is the

918
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,118
fluorescence decline ratio is looking at

919
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
this peak value but were uh compared to

920
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,680
what happens here you can see the

921
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,760
changes in control values versus treated

922
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:10,519
values the differences occur in this

923
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,640
quenching area right so you got to

924
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,079
measure them you got to be able to

925
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,199
measure them to see them but that's

926
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,079
where you're going to find your

927
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:19,519
signatures for uh trait

928
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,400
Discovery uh salt stress in a rabid

929
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:27,039
opsis we look at FV over FM there's no

930
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,000
change in the parameter until about 4

931
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,960
days was if you look at the fluorescence

932
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,639
decline ratio it changes within two days

933
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,440
and youve just looking at the images you

934
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,799
can see the very distinct difference

935
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,599
when you apply these to a false color

936
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,160
palette this was interesting a study um

937
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,680
done by uh the young lady you saw in the

938
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,480
video she's interested in um starch

939
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,639
mutants of arabidopsis and how they

940
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,318
might be related to um osmotic

941
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:57,358
protection during drought stress and she

942
00:39:54,318 --> 00:40:00,838
had mutants of phosphoglucomutase alpar

943
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:03,000
am beta ralas and um looking at the

944
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:05,159
fluorescence characteristics of these

945
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,079
there's no change in the Fe over FM when

946
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,480
you impose the D distress on them but

947
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,039
the phosphoglucomutase mutant if you

948
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,719
look at uh this parameter FP over fo no

949
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,679
change from the initial whereas the

950
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,199
others change very significantly don't

951
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,960
know the basis for this but it's

952
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:24,118
interesting that when you look at

953
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,960
survivability of these mutants it's the

954
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,640
phosphoglucomutase mutant which survived

955
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,639
and the others had a very very poorer

956
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:35,598
survivability so the conclusion for this

957
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,559
I would argue is that F FM in some in

958
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,480
some cases is valuable but it's a blunt

959
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,719
instrument for looking at stress

960
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,519
particularly rapid onset of stress um

961
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:48,879
light adapted kinetics provide earlier

962
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:51,639
indications and more significant changes

963
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,960
so you've got this balance between plant

964
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,358
phenotyping one in a huge throughput

965
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,519
which means measure everything as

966
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,358
quickly as possible

967
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,000
and the problem of measuring things

968
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,119
properly so you can collect a huge

969
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,519
amount of data very very quickly collect

970
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,880
a huge amount of useless data very

971
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,079
quickly or you can spend your time and

972
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,920
collect more useful data and it's up to

973
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,079
you to decide on your experimental

974
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,960
designs which of those two approaches

975
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,519
you you you're going to

976
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,880
adopt um just very briefly root screen

977
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,159
I've talked to some people this morning

978
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,760
about root screening so I thought I'd

979
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:25,879
throw this in it's really really

980
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,440
difficult to screen Roots phenotypically

981
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,318
very very hard they're in the soil what

982
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,318
are you going to do with imaging you

983
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,279
know it's it's very difficult using

984
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,480
translucent tubes is fine there's been a

985
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,760
lot of fine work done Imaging just with

986
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,920
RGB cameras plants grown in gels problem

987
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,359
is they're grown in gels they're not the

988
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,200
root characteristics are not going to be

989
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:50,039
the same as in the soil um in

990
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:52,480
translucent tubes is the same well it's

991
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,358
not the same because you've got soil but

992
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,240
you have to wait for the plant to grow

993
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:58,880
before the roots hit the periphery of

994
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,479
the you Bo you can actually see them so

995
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,000
if you're interested in what happens in

996
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,639
early germination Etc you're not going

997
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,440
to see it at all and then only 5 to 10%

998
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,879
of this roots are going to be visible at

999
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,119
the edge of a typical pot and you have

1000
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,039
to extrapolate your morphological

1001
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,440
parameters back to the whole root system

1002
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,559
which is not something I would be

1003
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,480
comfortable doing lowd do x-rays plants

1004
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,279
growing in plastic beads these are great

1005
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,960
wonderful uh you can actually there's

1006
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,280
wonderful videos on the web of roots

1007
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,679
growing when on on when they being x-ray

1008
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,720
again they're imp plastic beads it's a

1009
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,838
hydroponic system it's not soil ground

1010
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,239
penetrating radar there's guys at Texas

1011
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,599
A&amp;M I've talked to some people this

1012
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,479
morning about how this is done I think

1013
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,280
it's a long long way before we're going

1014
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,559
to be able to see Roots using ground

1015
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,559
penetration radar just too much

1016
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,640
interference the one I think is most

1017
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,760
promising is rotron studies uh this is a

1018
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,239
system developed at ulic these are

1019
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,960
rotron here the plants are grown the the

1020
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,639
rotron these are root boxes with uh

1021
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,599
with perspects in the front so we can

1022
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,639
image the The Roots as they go through

1023
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:05,920
the system the plants grow vertically

1024
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,118
downwards and then when they hit this

1025
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,240
45° angle they spread out so now we can

1026
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,079
see a Much More Much More Much Greater

1027
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,838
proportion of the roots then you would

1028
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,519
in say a translucent pot and um some

1029
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,719
nice data have come out of this I'd

1030
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,880
refer you to this paper in functional

1031
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:25,639
plant biology you know using a 16

1032
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,880
megapixel camera they got very good

1033
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:30,598
resolution uh looking at root length

1034
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,358
branch in rate spatial distribution this

1035
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,800
is something which we're hoping to

1036
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:37,318
integrate into our into our plant screen

1037
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,760
systems I'm just going to finish off um

1038
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:43,279
I've been rabbiting on

1039
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:47,520
um these systems are expensive don't

1040
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,400
hide the fact they are quite complex um

1041
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,119
very

1042
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,599
sophisticated uh take up a lot of arer

1043
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,960
typically in a growth room in a

1044
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,920
greenhouse if you want to do thousands

1045
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,559
of plants conveyor belt systems

1046
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,720
you can do things less expensively for

1047
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,800
example plant by plant if you have

1048
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,519
enough people uh to go around your

1049
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,400
plants and put your Leaf under this Leaf

1050
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,318
clip you can get beautiful chlorophyll

1051
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,960
fluorescence kinetics you can also do

1052
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:18,838
this in algae uh using a probe which you

1053
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,920
can put into a submerged culture it's

1054
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,480
not Imaging data it's average data over

1055
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,119
the area of the optical window of these

1056
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,159
systems but you get the full quenching

1057
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,200
parameters using this device this Floren

1058
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,318
device um you also get downloads via

1059
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,639
Bluetooth graphical representation of

1060
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:40,079
the chlorophyll fluorescent kinetics so

1061
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,558
you can go out in the field and you can

1062
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,880
make lots and lots of measurements um

1063
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,000
using a system which will cost you about

1064
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,599
maximum about $3 and half thousand

1065
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,159
including your measuring

1066
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,800
photosynthetically active radiation even

1067
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,279
GPS location in the field and all of

1068
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,000
your kinetic

1069
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,000
values um there's other devices

1070
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,440
specifically for hyperspectral

1071
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,760
measurements like ndvi and PRI these um

1072
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,679
are uh specific for these a single pen

1073
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,000
will do each of these my friends who I

1074
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:17,000
dinner with last night now tell me that

1075
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,318
they've been building systems for even a

1076
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,519
tenth of the cost of this these cost

1077
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,800
about $1,200 $1,300 these guys here at

1078
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,480
Cornell they so bright they can throw

1079
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,680
them together for 200 bucks so don't buy

1080
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,318
them from me buy them from from those

1081
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:34,159
guys yeah um I'm happy with that

1082
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,039
uh what we have also though is a poly

1083
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,719
pen which is a handheld

1084
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,558
spectrometer and um there are a couple

1085
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,118
of versions of this there's a spectr pen

1086
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,599
in which there's no Leaf clip and you

1087
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,039
can point this or any light source and

1088
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,240
it'll give you a beautiful Spectrum it's

1089
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,920
great for calibrating light sources it's

1090
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,719
great for going into your growth rooms

1091
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,920
and seeing whether your light yesterday

1092
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,598
is the same as it was uh today etc etc

1093
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,559
you can do all types of chrom

1094
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,960
chromaticity measurements with it but

1095
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:03,559
when you have the um the leaf clip here

1096
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,880
you can get a full reflectance scan

1097
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:09,640
across these ranges 380 to 780 640 to

1098
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,640
1050 NM from which you can get

1099
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:15,920
automatically calculated your reflective

1100
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,440
indices IND indicative of the pigment

1101
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,960
concentrations in the plant and and

1102
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,920
various other biochemical uh status uh

1103
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,960
uh of the plant as well so um that's a

1104
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,599
very interesting thing what um I would

1105
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,480
recommend if any of you have large

1106
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:36,200
amounts of money and you uh you want to

1107
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,880
spend it on plant phenotyping systems uh

1108
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,199
you can make very expensive Mistakes by

1109
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,318
going to the wrong place so I would

1110
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:45,879
suggest that you try before you buy and

1111
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,400
to do that all you need to do is jump on

1112
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,160
a plane to the cat Republic this

1113
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,480
beautiful place in drazo we have uh PhD

1114
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,960
level plant scientists we have Engineers

1115
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,440
we have programmers we have a wonderful

1116
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,318
Research Center here we build a lot of

1117
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,000
things on on site we have wonderful

1118
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:06,119
engineering we can run proof of concept

1119
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,039
experiments we have students there who

1120
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,880
are doing their masters and phds from

1121
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,159
local universities and universities

1122
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,720
throughout Europe it's a great place to

1123
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:18,399
visit these are great people to go out

1124
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:21,919
drinking with and um good beer in the CH

1125
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,880
Republic and I I please come over please

1126
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
come and chat with me jump on the plane

1127
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,280
we'll have some fun and we'll show you

1128
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,599
the the stuff actually does work and if

1129
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,200
you want to push it to its limit and you

1130
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,240
want to push it Beyond its limit we're

1131
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,919
also very very keen for you to tell us

1132
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,000
what you want and your ideas how we

1133
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,639
might implement it and how we might even

1134
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,920
work together to push plant phenotyping

1135
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:49,000
to the next stage so uh thank you very

1136
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,519
very much for the invite and uh thank

1137
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,519
you for your attention

1138
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,960
well thank you this has been a
