1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,740
University

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,798
thank you very much for the invitation

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,919
it's a real honor to be here and speak

5
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:15,718
and the chance to tell you about our

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,059
work and I will jump in so I don't run

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,129
over time and give you an overview on

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,899
some of the really interesting questions

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,869
we've been able to ask in fungal

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,089
evolution and so I want to also pay

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,830
tribute to the beauty of the different

12
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,159
organisms that we get to work on in

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:35,099
fungal biology and in my ecology and

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,799
this is sort of just a couple of plates

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,760
from a recent paper book chapter that we

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,288
put out that is part of this new book

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,530
called the fungal Kingdom where there's

18
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,300
a lot of really great chapters about

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,698
different aspects of the globe biology

20
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,678
but it includes some paying homage to

21
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:53,849
some of these these beautiful beautiful

22
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,559
structures and I think what I want to

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,198
emphasize is that if you don't work on

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,058
fungi is that they are of course you

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,189
know many different cell types and

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,378
sudden shapes and sizes and colors that

27
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,019
we see and at trophic interactions and

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,210
so trying to understand the evolution of

29
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,589
these groups of organisms how they're

30
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,658
related to each other and how some of

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,310
these different forms came about is one

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,659
of the driving questions that we've the

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,269
we've been doing in my lab and across

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,579
the the collaborative community on this

35
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,039
work and so one of the driving questions

36
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:27,899
is what are the what are the

37
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,289
evolutionary relationships of the fungi

38
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:33,180
if I minimize this that's okay so what

39
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:36,960
are the evolutionary relationships among

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,520
fungi and so this has been a driving the

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,099
part of fungal systematics and first we

42
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,259
used morphological characteristics

43
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,548
sometimes Ecology's to group things then

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,590
with the ability to use molecular

45
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,130
systematics to it resolve the fungal

46
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,950
phylogenies that was driven in part by

47
00:01:53,129 --> 00:02:00,019
the ability to peat use PCR to sequence

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,539
the the ribosomal locus regions and then

49
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:05,429
one of the landmark papers in 2006 as

50
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,129
part of the trio life work was able to

51
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:10,050
use a six gene phylogeny to resolve the

52
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,879
major lineages and we thought okay we've

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,520
got a good map of how these organisms

54
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,650
are related but in fact as we start to

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,909
look carefully at those trees we realize

56
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,120
there are places that we don't really

57
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,878
fully understand the resolution

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,009
so we need additional sampling of both

59
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,929
markers and lineages to get at that and

60
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,489
some of the places that I'm going to

61
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,349
emphasize where we didn't know that we

62
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,390
don't know the answer and we maybe still

63
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:34,310
have questions relate to some of what we

64
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:37,518
might call early branches or at least

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,250
what are what are the less appreciated

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,659
lineages in the past perhaps but things

67
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,639
like zygoma seed fungi and the

68
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,348
flagellated Kitteridge fungi were some

69
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,719
of the order of the branchings have been

70
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,889
unresolved and that even with within

71
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,509
groups of things that are well studied

72
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,488
like to the studio my seeds which

73
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:54,169
include mushrooms but also Smuts and

74
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,049
rust some of those relationships

75
00:02:54,169 --> 00:03:01,818
unresolved even with with sort of large

76
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:04,939
sampling and gene sets so one approach

77
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:10,669
to try to solve this problem is to

78
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:11,719
sequence more and so one one question

79
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:13,399
that we'd like to understand is it was

80
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,900
is how they're related but why do we

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,459
care about the tree so being able to

82
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,239
have a tree of how they're related to

83
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,250
each other

84
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,739
allows us to look at when characters

85
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,289
evolved when did ecological associations

86
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,000
arise do they arise multiple times not

87
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,340
all plant pathogens come from a single

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,919
origin so timing when those those

89
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,180
changes occurred but also in look at

90
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,708
more broader context the the rise of

91
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,480
diversity of fungi could be correlated

92
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,639
with the rise in diversity of plants a

93
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,848
rise in diversity of insects and so

94
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,349
understanding better the timing is what

95
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,179
the phylogenetic work allows us to

96
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:49,818
present and then to correlate that with

97
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,260
other kinds of characteristics and in on

98
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:55,518
top of that we also can see things like

99
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:56,989
interesting morphological origins and so

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,459
for example on the top left here I'll

101
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,259
only briefly talk about this fungus

102
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,389
called endogamy which looks like a

103
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,250
truffle but as part of the zygoma a

104
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,500
fungi which are typically we look at

105
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,150
them as filamentous molds and so we have

106
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,969
examples of things that have really

107
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,739
complex morphology embedded within a

108
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,539
group of organisms that don't share that

109
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,788
and so understanding how many times

110
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:20,149
those kinds of complexities arise is

111
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:22,339
really interesting and requires a well

112
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,228
resolved phylogenetic tree and

113
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,939
relationships so how do we get at that

114
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,709
we try to sequence on two things to get

115
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,418
at this better right this is probably an

116
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:31,250
overused graphic but the idea that we

117
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:33,299
would like to understand how they're

118
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,158
related the easiest thing that we can do

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,189
especially with today's technology is

120
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:39,870
just turn the crank and generate more

121
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,219
sequencing and so of course through our

122
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,840
partnership with the joint genome

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,520
Institute where there's a lot of

124
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,728
sequencing capacity and the and the

125
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:51,598
interest and ability to try to generate

126
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:55,408
more sequencing more genomes and and and

127
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:57,389
sampling the the the lineages to to

128
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:58,860
capture this diversity and so our effort

129
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,360
that would the initial what we call

130
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,699
community sequencing project that we

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,139
proposed was was we called it a thousand

132
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,468
fungal genomes because we wanted to have

133
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,780
a big large number and there were there

134
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:12,750
at the time approximately five hundred

135
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,728
families of fungi so this is the Noah's

136
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,879
Ark of fungi we get to from every group

137
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:18,598
and we make sure they're covered

138
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,270
truthfully they're of course more than

139
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:23,430
that but more families than 500 but this

140
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,948
is a nice starting place and so the

141
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,370
initial goals are to better reconstruct

142
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,650
the phyla

143
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,840
phylogeny using many gene phylogeny is

144
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,370
not a six gene phylogeny but also to

145
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,560
look at how the genomes evolved look at

146
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,090
how they change and content look at

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,728
things like how Congress carbohydrate

148
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,679
active enzyme chain enzymes have change

149
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:42,810
which relate to how organisms get their

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,759
nutrients but also other aspects of

151
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,800
their biology so I'm going to give you a

152
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,020
survey of some of the things that we've

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,009
done I'm going to indulge myself a

154
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,568
little bit and talk a little bit about

155
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,038
some side projects I think are

156
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,840
interesting that we're related to some

157
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,139
of these investigations and then tell

158
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,418
you one story about about complex

159
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,288
multicellularity so another part of this

160
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,878
is of course it's important to to take

161
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:07,288
sometimes a focused approach to some of

162
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,000
these questions and so one group that's

163
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,560
not received as much attention in the

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,228
past for some of these genome sequencing

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,509
projects and and molecular genetics in

166
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,250
some ways has been what might be called

167
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,680
the early diverging fungi but does I go

168
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,028
my seat's and also the kids read fungi

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,579
and so as I go my seats were previously

170
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,810
thought to be one lineage but I'll show

171
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,870
you in a second that there are actually

172
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,610
two major lineages of that that that

173
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,918
constitute what are called Zygo my seats

174
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:36,689
on our funded project to look at these

175
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,639
was to target about a hundred and fifty

176
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,620
reference genomes in this lineage and

177
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,870
these lineages and also to generate

178
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,699
between 500 and a thousand like coverage

179
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,918
genomes that allow us to fill in the

180
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,259
gaps so I'm going to take a second okay

181
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,329
we live in 2017 even when we propose us

182
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,030
it was 2014 but though we could take a

183
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:57,089
really understudied group of organisms

184
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,609
and proposed to do 150 genomes in that

185
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:02,128
it's kind of staggering to me to think

186
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,749
about where we where we are in the in

187
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,460
our in our lifetime and are in a

188
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,069
technology that we have available to you

189
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,508
and the cost so I cannot i can't project

190
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,400
yet what's going to be ten years from

191
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,930
now how house i'll straight forward

192
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,968
hopefully some of these things are gonna

193
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,490
be and and and the scale of things that

194
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:19,079
we can do so I want to take some time

195
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,968
for flippant about how many genomes we

196
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,519
can sequence but I do recognize that

197
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:25,439
this is this is a nice a nice thing that

198
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,389
we can that we have access to now and in

199
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,300
a way to drive our sequence our

200
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,889
questions by sequencing so in addition

201
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,870
to sequencing we also want to understand

202
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,019
the biology these organisms and previous

203
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,788
work had been looked at aspects of the

204
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,098
characteristics of these so for example

205
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:43,288
fungi that grow in Highfill forms have a

206
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,968
have a concentration of vesicles at the

207
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:47,149
tip called the spits incorpor and that's

208
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:50,158
found in Icaria fungi like like

209
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:52,288
Aspergillus or Neurospora um and it's

210
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,389
found in some of these eigem I see fungi

211
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:56,188
which form hyphy but not all of them and

212
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,650
so Robbie Robertson who's an expert in

213
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,419
imaging has been working on using this

214
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,429
big collection of zygoma see punch I

215
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,778
didn't look at which of these have spits

216
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,610
and corporate and when that evolves

217
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:07,139
that's one side question that's that's

218
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,149
being looked at a second thing is that

219
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,710
these are typically when if you teach my

220
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,228
ecology you take my ecology we talk

221
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,588
about Zygo myci fungi as seem acidic is

222
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,568
that they don't have cept up but in fact

223
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:22,199
that is not the case for all of these so

224
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:23,908
understanding when and how septal septal

225
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,528
compartmentalization evolved in these

226
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:27,300
groups is important and that's the other

227
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,588
thing just just to show you we don't

228
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,360
know everything about these fungi when

229
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,560
you have better imaging I hadn't movie

230
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,778
but it's not it's not going to show here

231
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,649
but these little vesicles here we don't

232
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:36,299
know what they are they're probably

233
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,889
lipid containing but they actually move

234
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,668
quite fast I have a real-time video and

235
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,740
it is moving quite fast and and this is

236
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,980
a more DRLs species that makes lots of

237
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,139
lipids okay and so so understanding this

238
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,850
is you know useful in the industry but

239
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,669
also interesting from from a biological

240
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,889
standpoint and then the flossing is just

241
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,849
that it's a technological project and so

242
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,740
some of these efforts to generate

243
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,840
single-cell genomes because some of

244
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,370
these organisms we can't grow alone

245
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,200
so we have to grow them with a host and

246
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,850
so some of the projects with the jgi are

247
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,890
about taking infected tissue and

248
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,810
isolating single sport single spores or

249
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,879
single cells sequencing those we have

250
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,199
several single cell genome projects that

251
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,250
are going on okay so what can we do with

252
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,250
some of these genomes I'm gonna give you

253
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:24,929
some ten thousand foot view views of

254
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,759
these data and so for example um these

255
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,989
genomes vary in size right now and this

256
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,580
sort of sampling that I'm showing you

257
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,529
between excuse me ten you know a to two

258
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,270
hundred and fifty mega bases and in size

259
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,850
now there are fungal genomes that are

260
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:40,949
about seven hundred mega bases to about

261
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,769
1.5 Giga bases these are some of these

262
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,240
intimate pathogenic fungi they're harder

263
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,889
the sequence because they're so big but

264
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,389
we do have draft assemblies of a few of

265
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,740
those and so there are some things that

266
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,750
are bigger than that and full of

267
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,000
transposons but here's a snapshot of the

268
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,889
of the main bulk of about 400 of these

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,299
genomes that have come out and what you

270
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,429
can see is that his genome size gets

271
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,169
bigger you have more genes but you do

272
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:03,779
have species that fall off that curve

273
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:06,000
that have large genomes but not so many

274
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,189
genes and those represent genomes that

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
have a lot of trans poseable elements in

276
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,250
their genome so the genome was bigger

277
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,769
but that space has taken up with by

278
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,759
transposons not coding protein coding

279
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:21,769
genes so that's interesting

280
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:24,480
observational E and we can also look at

281
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:31,610
the next page we can also look at

282
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:34,860
another dynamic of that genome size and

283
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,750
gene gene size so for example some of

284
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,149
the organisms have very small genomes

285
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,059
Micro security are these obligate

286
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,289
intracellular parasites they have very

287
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,079
small genomes at the bottom left corner

288
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:49,860
here you know two mega base 4 mega base

289
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,710
genomes and they but they also have very

290
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,419
short genes on average so you've made

291
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,490
your genome smaller and the genes in

292
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,110
your genome have gotten smaller so

293
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,879
that's an example of presumably of

294
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,980
contraction and then you have other

295
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,870
organisms that have long transcripts but

296
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,279
not necessarily a bigger genome of the

297
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,320
up at the top here so there's different

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,329
patterns not everything can be ascribed

299
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,040
to ecology but those are interesting

300
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,870
observations we can make and then one

301
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,519
other thing that we can look at is just

302
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,250
the genome the

303
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,049
the size of the genome and the number of

304
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,000
introns that we see and so this is a

305
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,649
case where we can see of different

306
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,419
clades so the colors here represent

307
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,980
different major clades of fungi that

308
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,199
different clades have really different

309
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,028
properties and this is again indulgence

310
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,100
to my PhD thesis where I worked a little

311
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,389
bit on this and what we find is that

312
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,909
things like sacra mica Tina

313
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:38,338
so Saccharomyces have very few introns

314
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:40,230
that's that top left corner here right

315
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,060
so they have they only have like 300

316
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,209
introns in the whole genome and some of

317
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,469
these species um and then then we have

318
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,419
other species down here at the bottom

319
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,570
the mushrooms that tend to have many

320
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,309
many and introns per gene okay and so

321
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,110
the scale is kind of reversed cuz it's

322
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,028
about how big the exons are not how many

323
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,589
introns but this but the idea is that so

324
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:00,149
you can see that this kind of falls out

325
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,399
by some of the colors and so there's a

326
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,289
history in how intra gene structure

327
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,389
involves in fungi and we're able to

328
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:09,240
compare that across across common sets

329
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,708
so anyways there's differences fungi

330
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,120
fungal genomes are not uniform that

331
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,579
might be one takeaway that you can get

332
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,799
from this and some of that's driven by

333
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,300
historical patterns okay so how do we

334
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,039
understand how these organisms are

335
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,449
related to each other so one thing we

336
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,629
can do is try to build phylogenetic

337
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,879
trees and so one pipeline that we use is

338
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,879
using both a set of predetermined

339
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,578
conserved proteins um that we have about

340
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,799
we have 434 that we picked out that that

341
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,778
behaved well as being found in most

342
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,699
fungi and also in some of the out groups

343
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,379
that we were going to use and we we

344
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,839
identify these proteins in all of our

345
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,549
genomes in a rapid succession and then

346
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,980
build multiple alignments of each of

347
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:49,078
those we can trim and quality control

348
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,789
and concatenate those and build

349
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,828
phylogenetic trees from concatenated

350
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:55,289
datasets as well as individual gene

351
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:59,099
trees we look at congruence of all of

352
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:01,259
these and try to a generator

353
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,579
a consensus phylogeny of the organisms

354
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,230
to understand how they're related so for

355
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,699
those again this is maybe for those of

356
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,200
you who are interested in the methods

357
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,660
part and then we're also trying to

358
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
understand when the these organisms

359
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,919
diverge from each other so we also

360
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:18,000
incorporate a fossil data that's been

361
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,370
collected and and calibrate some of the

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,570
time points in in the in the tree okay

363
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,159
and when I first heard his project was

364
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,528
like a flint I don't leave fossils what

365
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,088
do you need but Tom Taylor the late Tom

366
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:30,490
Taylor and his work did

367
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,139
using work on paleo botany and being

368
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,818
able to collect and identify and

369
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,039
characterize structures that seem to be

370
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:38,349
fungal and he was part he was part of

371
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,169
our grant project grant and our project

372
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,850
to to collect more of these especially

373
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,349
for this i go myseif fungi but also to

374
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,790
put that in so again I've already showed

375
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,399
you this tree we can generate a really

376
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:50,769
big beautiful tree that is hard to read

377
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,539
and then we can start summarize that and

378
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,610
submit the other major lineages and so

379
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:56,230
some of the things that we we learned

380
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,720
and I'm going to come back to this point

381
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,610
again is that we do these are sort of

382
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,230
known relationships of the dike area

383
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,449
fungi that asked on my seats in the city

384
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,889
of my seats but that one of the major

385
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:08,139
findings is that what we called the new

386
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,558
quorum I Koda now represents these three

387
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,568
lineages um used to be kind of an in a

388
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,490
arrayed more more closely with the Dyke

389
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:17,708
area that this glow marrow Mike Mike

390
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,539
Mike Cota used to be more closely

391
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,128
related here and now we find them as one

392
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:23,708
group and that the second group we call

393
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:26,558
ZOA Pago my coda represent organisms

394
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:28,688
that are in some of pathogenic fungi as

395
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:31,360
well as Mykel parasites that in fact

396
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:33,099
that in fact other fungi so those are

397
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,100
really fun to study but hard hard to

398
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,959
dissect in the lab and then we have some

399
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,379
unresolved lineages in here that

400
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,119
represent lineages of the Katrina my

401
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,528
coda which we have the kids and the

402
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,389
blasto create in my code of both of

403
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:48,338
these groups have flagella flagellated

404
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,079
zoa's for fun drive but the branching

405
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,639
order has been a little bit ambiguous we

406
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,828
do think that probably blasto clade in

407
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,019
my coda is the earliest grant as is the

408
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,399
sister to the rest and that these that

409
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,249
the Katrina my code or sister to these

410
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,778
but that's in still a little bit

411
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:03,670
challenging and again there's other

412
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:04,509
unknowns that we have now I can just

413
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,318
throwing in here more for the

414
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:11,318
aficionados that help us try to we have

415
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:14,948
the city obelisk and an opium which are

416
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:16,178
part of the this looks like a kid but it

417
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,919
actually groups within these groups

418
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,480
right now and so trying to understand

419
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,789
these relationships is still part of

420
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,889
things and things that are ongoing okay

421
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,448
so how do we look at the dating of this

422
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,720
of this this phylogeny

423
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:31,568
by incorporating these different fossil

424
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:35,980
calibration points we're able to put

425
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:36,969
some dates on the fungal emergence and

426
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,740
so one of the interesting things is

427
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,149
there is a window of time when many of

428
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,930
the fungal of phyla emerged

429
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,759
um which which is also related to

430
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:50,120
similar timing to win we start to see

431
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,939
the explosion of land plant diversity so

432
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,289
there's but but what's interesting is a

433
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,180
lot of these are kind of time to the

434
00:15:54,289 --> 00:16:00,649
same within the same period and that

435
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,899
that a lot of that the diversity that we

436
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,250
see kind of arose here and this in this

437
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,350
win this window of time as best we can

438
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,590
we can estimate so again these are these

439
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,420
are helpful in trying to put the context

440
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,740
as to wind and fungal diversity come

441
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,269
about and again if you didn't sort of

442
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,799
haven't seen this before but we do think

443
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,509
that kind of the origin of fungi

444
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,939
depending on how you how you define

445
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:23,629
fungi but is probably in about a about a

446
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,970
billion years ago so that's an old group

447
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,879
of organisms if you if you put them all

448
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:33,170
on that the way I say if because there's

449
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:35,090
some debate or some some worth a

450
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,919
discussion about how do you define the

451
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,300
what is a fungus and there's actually

452
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,159
great chapter from Tom Richards in that

453
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:42,500
book about about these definitions but

454
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,569
at any rate this is a helpful to look at

455
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,090
the context so what can we do only look

456
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:51,050
at these genomes of these organisms and

457
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,970
so one aspect that is interesting is we

458
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:54,799
can look at gene diversity and

459
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,480
innovation and duplication so what I'm

460
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,709
plotting here is this is as a species

461
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,680
tree of about seventy two fungi and I'm

462
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,440
putting in these colors the these these

463
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,319
circles where there are pulses of more

464
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,580
copies of gene families and so the idea

465
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,529
is this is when there is divert there

466
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,389
has been innovation in the history of

467
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,500
these organisms and so you can see that

468
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,730
there are a couple of so it's not

469
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,650
uniform right it's not that there's a

470
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,690
pulse and every node there are certain

471
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,900
nodes that have a lot of games and so

472
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:26,809
these seem to be related to this this

473
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,830
this big burst of diversity and so one

474
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,319
of the things again when we talk about

475
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,939
one wended fungi emerge at this this

476
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,250
label I put here at the bottom there

477
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,480
isn't a lot of diversification happening

478
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,400
at that node it actually happens a

479
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,230
little bit later in terms of the games

480
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,840
that we see in terms of the new gene

481
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,549
families in new diversification but

482
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,500
that's an interesting another way that

483
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,180
we can kind of put this in context so we

484
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,019
do think this helps us better understand

485
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,460
when some of the changes that might have

486
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,529
driven some of the fungal specific

487
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,150
biology

488
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,609
what might have occurred I mean we also

489
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,720
do find big examples of gains and I'm

490
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,299
gonna talk more about this group in a

491
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,390
second that relate to horizontal gene

492
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:06,619
transfer as well okay so the one group I

493
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,400
was just mentioning and I'm gonna go

494
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,989
through some of this a little bit

495
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,300
quicker so I can get to the end but is

496
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,039
that the is the Neo Callum astok of my

497
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,809
code of fungi which are really fun to

498
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,299
say ten times fast in the row but are

499
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,039
the anaerobic gut fungi so you can find

500
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,720
these if you we're on an on-campus so

501
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,149
you might have cows that have fistulas

502
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,380
you can go in there and you can sample

503
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,140
fluid from the rumen and inside that

504
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,490
anaerobic fluid you can culture

505
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,530
anaerobic fungi and these are Zola's

506
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,269
pork fungi that are really weird

507
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,639
they don't have mitochondria they have

508
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,980
hydro zomes and they are obligate the

509
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,300
anaerobic and so in a project that we're

510
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,759
working on with Mustafa al Shaheed and

511
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,440
know how Yusef at Oklahoma State is to

512
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,490
sequence transcriptomes because these

513
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,830
genomes are a little bit hard to

514
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,880
sequence the pretty repeat heavy we

515
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,740
secrets transcriptomes

516
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,560
of about twenty-five twenty to

517
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,059
twenty-five of these species to try to

518
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,799
better understand their relationships

519
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,990
and so and this is a tree showing the

520
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,079
dating of this which is interesting in

521
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,299
this context because the so there this

522
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,069
group of anaerobic gut fungi these are

523
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,809
all the lineages that we can find were

524
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:10,879
able to sample of these groups and that

525
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:13,609
they emerge relatively recently they

526
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,290
actually a merv emerge pretty close to

527
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:18,229
that's what this green box here is the

528
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:20,329
origin of her Bavarian and mammals so

529
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,170
the ecological niche where we isolate

530
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:27,559
them from correlates in time with the

531
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,080
age of the group now there's a whole lot

532
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,730
of time on this branch between that

533
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,099
where did they come from before there

534
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,110
were room and guts to live in I don't

535
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,279
know but this is what we can talk about

536
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,109
with the samples that we can sample

537
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,420
today so there's maybe new other

538
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,559
interesting diversity oh look out but

539
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,380
this is an interesting way to look at

540
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,079
that and then one of its re another

541
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,310
thing we can look at is the is the

542
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,869
evolution of some of this different

543
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,519
structures and so for example some of

544
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,349
these have polycentric and mono centric

545
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,269
forms and so we can see again that those

546
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:58,279
probably emerge multiple times within

547
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,259
these lineages and so again being able

548
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,849
to look at now gene content and genes

549
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,049
that are found in these groups is part

550
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:07,039
of trying to understand the

551
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:08,259
diversification there so and we can even

552
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,259
find genes

553
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,789
a kind of a pictorial just a and I just

554
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:16,240
was just to remind me to tell you that

555
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:18,009
these these fungi have lost certain

556
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,690
processes and gained other things and so

557
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:22,029
here's an example of a gene that's not

558
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,850
found in any any other fungi except for

559
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:26,289
some of the except for one weird group

560
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,929
called the called the city of the city

561
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,879
obelisk but that they have game genes

562
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,830
that an example of a gene that is

563
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,870
probably related to its it's gross an

564
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,369
ant it's an aerobic growth and so we can

565
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,659
find things that probably they had to

566
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,679
pick up that and the reason why I'm

567
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,750
showing you all these branches is that

568
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,519
all of these organisms all of these

569
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,589
agent fungi have it so isn't a

570
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,210
horizontal transfer of just one or a bad

571
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,609
genome assembly what we just picked it

572
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,870
up accidentally it's actually found in

573
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:51,759
all of these lineages and it's

574
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:53,709
diversified probably following the

575
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,809
species diversification so these might

576
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,420
be genes that are necessary or important

577
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:00,099
in that adaptation to being to that

578
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,289
ecological niche so we think this will

579
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,419
be cool ways to better understand the

580
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,889
biology as we start to map these and

581
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,960
there aren't that many genes that fall

582
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,450
into these categories of being unique to

583
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:16,029
or may be missing from the these

584
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:17,200
anaerobic ones but we do see again okay

585
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,759
so another thing we can do when we have

586
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,740
these genomes is try to ask other

587
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,849
questions about genome evolution and one

588
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,920
interesting thing that people ask a lot

589
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,539
in plants but hasn't been asked as much

590
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,250
in fungi is what happens when you get a

591
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,509
genome duplication now there's a well

592
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,160
told story about Saccharomyces

593
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:31,420
cerevisiae there was a whole genome

594
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,850
duplication about a hundred million

595
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,310
years ago and we can we can map what

596
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:38,439
happens to gene duplicates in the cut in

597
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,089
the time that occurs after the

598
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,920
duplication and this is really cool for

599
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,419
evolutionary biologists because there's

600
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,190
lots of theory about what happens when

601
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,860
you duplicate genes and you see what

602
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,980
happens after that and in plants one of

603
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:51,909
the ways that this was looked at from

604
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,200
transcriptomes in fact and something

605
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,300
from ken Wolf's lab that was first

606
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,480
published where these were these these

607
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:01,089
graphs where you show a plot of the

608
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,250
average synonomous site differences so

609
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:05,349
synonymous sites are are are neutral

610
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,390
basically supposed to be neutral changes

611
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:09,490
that you can count basically they're

612
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,530
calibrated with time so if you have a

613
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,720
whole genome duplication and you had a

614
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,609
hundred genes and you duplicate that to

615
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,009
200 genes and each of those has a pair

616
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,539
okay and at time point zero right after

617
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:21,730
the duplication the difference between

618
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,028
any of those pairs is zero because

619
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,190
they're

620
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:25,929
identical but as time passes and an

621
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,969
independent mutations occur in those

622
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,169
those those gene pairs each of them

623
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:31,389
starts to get different from each other

624
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,278
and that difference we can measure with

625
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:34,418
the synonymous sight difference and so

626
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:35,950
that difference looks kind of like a

627
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,259
peak it's not perfect right not every

628
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,450
gene gets the same number of changes but

629
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:42,098
that peak starts to move over time and

630
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,808
so you can actually guess when the

631
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:46,509
duplication occurred by looking at the

632
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:47,979
the the distribution of this peak right

633
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:50,469
and in plant genomes when we've seen

634
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,969
multiple duplications you see one peak

635
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,739
and then you see actually another peak

636
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:56,259
for multiple duplications there's like

637
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,489
an echo okay so that's what that's the

638
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,409
model that's the way you can approach

639
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:01,329
this so we can do this we have 300

640
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:03,219
genomes we can look for parallel I guess

641
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:05,168
genes and those genomes and we can ask

642
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,679
what's the synonymous site diversion

643
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,690
stuff though

644
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,849
okay and we can find examples like this

645
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,950
for a fungus like a Kittredge fungus

646
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,838
called alum Isis which has this nice

647
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,159
pattern of lots of things that are

648
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:17,710
duplicated right this is the sort of

649
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,719
distribution that we see um and it looks

650
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,669
like it's probably actually a diploid

651
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:22,838
assembly but they're the alleles are

652
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:24,580
pretty different from each other so they

653
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:27,398
didn't collapse into one so I don't know

654
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:28,808
the actual biology of why it has so many

655
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:30,069
copies but this is an example where we

656
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,598
think it's probably because it's a

657
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:33,548
diploid and we can look at something

658
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:34,898
like this across all of the genomes all

659
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:36,969
of the genomes and we get these patterns

660
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:38,168
right so nothing to nothing to look at

661
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:39,570
specifically there but we can pull up

662
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,879
something like Saccharomyces cerevisiae

663
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:45,368
where the duplication occurred a hundred

664
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:48,718
million years ago so that KS value has

665
00:23:45,368 --> 00:23:52,178
gotten really big they're not that

666
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:53,769
similar to each other all right this one

667
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,450
has this about 0.5 for the for the

668
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,919
sacrum I C's again there's only a few

669
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,838
that are really similar everything is

670
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,309
kind of enough time has occurred okay

671
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:02,739
but we can look more carefully you can

672
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:03,519
actually find an organism that does seem

673
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,379
to have this whole genome duplication

674
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,269
that occurred quite recently and that's

675
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,678
a fungus called hor Te'o or an FBI and

676
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:10,118
this had been previously described so

677
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,739
I'm cherry-picking here it's had already

678
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:13,478
been known as a genome withhold you

679
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:15,848
implication and they had done an initial

680
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:17,348
kind of low-quality Illumina sembly and

681
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:19,749
we did a pack bio assembly in

682
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:22,329
collaboration with Korena snows lab in

683
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,669
Canada and were able to then look at the

684
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:27,128
genome duplications and identify that

685
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,200
most genes were in this Janice orange

686
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:30,969
category here where it were duplicated

687
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,669
so most of the genes in the genome had

688
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,380
two copies and then we can look at the

689
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,520
dates of those gene the the

690
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,200
which age of those and see that

691
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,420
divergence time and so what's cool about

692
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,710
this is this is probably the this is

693
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,019
really a real whole genome duplication

694
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,759
and it's probably the most recent one

695
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:47,349
that we can identify based on these

696
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,210
comparisons of all the genomes that we

697
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:50,799
have because there's so many genes in

698
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,450
the genome that have that are that are

699
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,279
basically one-to-one paralogs

700
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,830
and that we can we can we can wrap it on

701
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:58,509
and so this is what it looks like it's a

702
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,859
black yeast it's an extreme of file in

703
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,650
the sense that it grows in really high

704
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:04,959
salt concentrations it was isolated

705
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,090
originally from these salt earns when

706
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,100
you make sea salts and you let the water

707
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,599
evaporate you can find some fungi

708
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:12,219
growing and this really high salt

709
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,829
molarity you could also find it in

710
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,089
marine environments and it's kind of

711
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:17,439
cool because they call it a yeast but

712
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,139
actually it grows filamentous lee it's a

713
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,340
video might seat and so if you look kind

714
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,380
of at that you know you look at these

715
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:24,789
cells under a dissection scope you can

716
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,140
see that they're actually these colonies

717
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,819
that have high c coming out so they're

718
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,840
not they're not really yeast even though

719
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:31,299
they're even they look make these kind

720
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,339
of gooey black stuff here when you look

721
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,899
on the plate and this is again oh this

722
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,339
my and other indulgences is that in our

723
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,480
lab we've also started working on some

724
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,549
extremophiles and so I had a

725
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,710
collaborating visiting student who works

726
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:43,480
on Antarctic endo lithic fungi a whole

727
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,980
other interesting question of you break

728
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,390
open rocks from Antarctica and you

729
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,430
culture what's inside them and you think

730
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:52,450
nothing but in fact they're a bunch of

731
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:55,090
fungi that do grow slowly and so one

732
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,009
species of that is called hor taya and a

733
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:59,230
species called for taya bile and akka

734
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,180
which is actually isolated from Thailand

735
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,980
so it's not only an extreme of file

736
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,480
living and cold but this will this is an

737
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,069
ice so they came from from Antarctica

738
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,750
and we sequenced attune above that and

739
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:09,609
put it in the tree and it's it's the

740
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,490
closest thing we have to it but it does

741
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,539
not have the whole genome duplication so

742
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,640
by being able to put this in the

743
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,990
phylogenetic context I can tell you that

744
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,150
there's a species that doesn't have the

745
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,680
duplication and a species that does so

746
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,600
now we have the ability look at what a

747
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,029
single copy gene in one species that's

748
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,990
duplicated into two and another okay so

749
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,940
this again from an evolutionary

750
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,680
molecular evolutionary perspective this

751
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,690
is a nice toolkit to be able to explore

752
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,060
more about that I don't know that any of

753
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,340
this tells us why it's able to live in

754
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,960
Antarctica or live in these extreme

755
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:39,339
environments but in just to advertise

756
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,600
that we sequence in blue or other

757
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,159
species from Antarctica that would

758
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,629
sequence the genome sport and we're

759
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,779
trying to understand a little bit better

760
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:49,020
how they know is are there any things

761
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:53,160
about being an extremophile that better

762
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:54,329
um Diagnostics about one other thing

763
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,800
about these duplicates is that we can

764
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,569
look at not only just the genes that are

765
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,940
there that copies the genes we can look

766
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:02,399
at their expression and so the gene

767
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,230
expression differences on the left here

768
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,030
in blue are how different the expression

769
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,410
values are for gene for these gene pairs

770
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,240
and so in general they tend to be very

771
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,550
similar to each other because they just

772
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,620
duplicated and they tend to have the

773
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,000
same nucleus or an occupancy but there

774
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,589
are some variation this is the this is a

775
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,299
comparing something like Saccharomyces

776
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:20,129
which has had a whole gene duplication

777
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,889
which is a lot older and so you see more

778
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,270
variation and the kinds of differential

779
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,520
expression that you're going to see

780
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,589
about copies but there are examples in

781
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,910
hor taya where there's a gene copy

782
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:32,189
that's expressed in high-salt

783
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,779
environments and a copy that's expressed

784
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,250
in low-salt environments there's there's

785
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,170
transporters and there's other things

786
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,329
about adaptation to that environment so

787
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,150
there's more to it than this but this is

788
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:44,009
kind of one snapshot view looking at the

789
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,430
ecology of an organism that's had this

790
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,900
duplication all right so I'm just going

791
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,250
to probably not going to cover

792
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,800
everything today which is fine

793
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,960
but as the zygolife project is again

794
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,359
this ability to sequence lots of these

795
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,230
genomes trying to sequence both with low

796
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:04,740
coverage genome approaches to get low

797
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:06,779
sampling sorry use low amounts of genome

798
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,430
sequencing to still get at enough

799
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,289
information to build gene trees or

800
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,700
species trees and try to do that can we

801
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,639
do a better job in sequencing the

802
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,830
ribosomal locus for doing bar coding and

803
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
so that's part of the driving that I'm

804
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:20,009
not going to put the trees in here for

805
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,019
this but it is it is working well but we

806
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:24,779
can also try to study it and so again

807
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,759
this is that's improved tree of the of

808
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,710
the Zygo my seat fungi that are really

809
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:33,029
in these two major lineages the

810
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:34,410
mucormycosis is just annoying for those

811
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:36,180
of you who teach psychology because you

812
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,160
got to update your slides I just want to

813
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,360
advertise this isn't important this is

814
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,540
important and trying to understand the

815
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,369
biology there and that again as I was

816
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,990
saying the Glo Maremma coda or mica Tina

817
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,729
do you feel like you've been demoted if

818
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,130
you have a mica Tina versus in my coda

819
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,390
but anyways these are again important

820
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,220
parts of that but one other thing that

821
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,980
we've done is that that's a little error

822
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,120
mic patina are an important lineage it's

823
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,170
hard to sequence these these are

824
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,049
obligate we can't

825
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,980
sequence them I can't grow them that

826
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:05,440
many of them in a lab so through singles

827
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,509
all our NSC sync single-cell amplify

828
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,460
amplify pation and RNA seek were able to

829
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:11,980
generate transcriptomes would work from

830
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,569
neko karate slab and we were and this

831
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,329
was just came out this finally just got

832
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:17,230
published this week but we have

833
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:18,909
improvements on the front of the

834
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,500
sampling of the phylogeny of the glow

835
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,019
Merrimack attina using this

836
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,910
single-celled RNA seek approach so again

837
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,980
improvements the phylogeny I'll just

838
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,690
better build a backbone that's based on

839
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,940
many many genes so now this is a four or

840
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,919
four or five hundred gene based tree

841
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,380
okay so this again just approaches that

842
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,240
we're able to use and this isn't so

843
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,040
important but just that pretty pictures

844
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,569
of these different cell types and that

845
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,119
we're able to grow we had to isolate

846
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:45,009
these all from from a plant and then

847
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,298
sort the cells and sequence from there

848
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,109
and in real this is all pioneered by

849
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:51,099
NEET by Nikko karate slab in in Ottawa

850
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,500
okay so the last thing I'm going to do

851
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,969
in my 10 10 minutes you want me to stop

852
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,519
it okay

853
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,019
15 okay I won't overwhelm you but is

854
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,700
that is this at one last question

855
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:01,720
evolution multicellularity in fun days

856
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,230
this is what I've been interested in

857
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,610
I've shown you lots of pictures of

858
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,558
microscopic fungi you of course

859
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,308
hopefully you live in a beautiful part

860
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,629
of the world where there lots of

861
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,029
mushrooms you walk outside you see a

862
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,830
mushroom or if you're unlucky and you

863
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:16,418
you you leave and where I am and leave

864
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,918
the hose on and suddenly there's just

865
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,850
this weird circular growing out of the

866
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,950
ground and your water you know in your

867
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:25,599
flowerbed so the so some fungi you like

868
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,529
some fun Joe you don't but the point is

869
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,139
that you know that there's really

870
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,808
different morphologies and really

871
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,490
different complexity that we might see

872
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:35,168
and so what we'd like to understand is

873
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,240
how does some of that come about and can

874
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,980
we can we map map win and win and time

875
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,919
and and what kind of changes might be

876
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,079
important to that and so we did this in

877
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,690
part because we observe these examples

878
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,579
multiple examples in the fungal tree of

879
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,179
organisms that make multicellular

880
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:53,199
structures and so here I'm showing you

881
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,970
sort of a sampling of the fungal

882
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,259
phylogeny and here I'm showing you this

883
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,200
thing called I'm doggin II which falls

884
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:00,879
within hours I go might see fungi

885
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,669
alright so most is itemizing fungi are

886
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,020
my croissant s we have this thing that

887
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:07,540
makes it makes a truffle it looks

888
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:09,039
something like a tuber truffle here and

889
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,418
then we of course have mushrooms and we

890
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,009
have some other other examples of

891
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,020
structures and one of those is an

892
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:16,839
organism called neo Lecter it's in blue

893
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:17,980
here so Neil ekta is

894
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,119
all within a group that you might

895
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,419
recognize at least one of these names

896
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:26,619
schizosaccharomyces pombe right a 4,500

897
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:28,450
gene yeast or that single cell that has

898
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,829
vision yeast and then we have this

899
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,808
organism called the Electra that makes

900
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:34,119
these these fruiting bodies look a lot

901
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:36,879
like earth tones but they're not and so

902
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:39,459
this has been an enigma as to what this

903
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,440
thing is first of all is it really an

904
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,610
ask amazing fungus is really a scum I

905
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,009
see fungus it falls within what we call

906
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:47,168
it to fry on my gatinha Pneumocystis is

907
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:49,509
like again like a single-cell obligate

908
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:52,480
parasite of lungs we have things in here

909
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:55,210
that this ayah saya telah is a is a

910
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,669
yeast so why are we seeing this sort of

911
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,140
thing that makes his big relatively big

912
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,740
structures we're how did that come about

913
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,600
so again if you have a hammer everything

914
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,190
is a nail so we sequence the genome of

915
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,288
it of course no this is court we can't

916
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,298
culture it so we had to sequence for

917
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:11,769
fruiting bodies which which worked out

918
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:13,599
okay did not make the it made a

919
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:15,099
reasonably good assembly but not not as

920
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,949
good as we you know you get with some of

921
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:21,158
the other projects but um but it allows

922
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,679
us to try to use use this system to try

923
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,190
to compare the Elector with these with

924
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,500
these multicellular fruiting bodies to

925
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,210
other organisms related to don't make

926
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,740
that as well as things that we have good

927
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,740
model systems for like neurons but

928
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,769
Krasner Aspergillus lens or or or

929
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,450
copra knob system mushrooms and so we

930
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:42,099
can take those four carcass and sequence

931
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,288
them and so when we look at some really

932
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:46,869
again like top level statistics our

933
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,140
genomes of organisms that are

934
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:51,879
multicellular more complex in the sense

935
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,770
that they're bigger right you would

936
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,299
might think that if you have a more

937
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:57,819
complicated fruiting body structure

938
00:32:55,298 --> 00:33:00,099
maybe you have more genes and the answer

939
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,750
is no so here we go neil Ekta falls

940
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,028
within all of these are basically what

941
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,440
we might call single-celled

942
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:07,269
yeast most least forming for the most

943
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,370
part and here are some of our

944
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:12,069
filamentous his eyes oh my Catina fungi

945
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:15,369
here are mushrooms and you can see that

946
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:17,470
it does not have more genes than it did

947
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:19,949
its relatives or the things that it

948
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,630
share that well so it's not a gene count

949
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,029
perspective we can look and see if

950
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,799
there's any example of lots of gene

951
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:29,408
games because have a lot of novel genes

952
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,879
that nobody else has any left is in blue

953
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:33,070
here and basically we only

954
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,240
find the sort of number you know so

955
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:37,869
something on the order of this sort of

956
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,849
800 gained relative to some of its other

957
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:42,159
relatives are on this branch only about

958
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:45,719
25 genes really represents her the

959
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,620
novelty in this lineage so it's not

960
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,150
gaining a whole bunch of stuff and

961
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:50,679
losing a bunch of other stuff it's not

962
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:54,100
like it has some mass of a new set of

963
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,200
settings okay so that's curious that

964
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,969
didn't that was maybe one believable

965
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,789
hypothesis or still possible how long is

966
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,900
this that was not that was not supported

967
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,700
so then we wanted to look more broadly

968
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,500
what are the genes that we can find

969
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,110
other organisms that we call complex

970
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,059
multicellular and some of these these

971
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,309
organisms may accept a high fee and they

972
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:13,480
have channels to separate cells which

973
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:15,128
are really different we wanted to

974
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,449
understand when did this gating

975
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:19,119
mechanism evolve and I explained that in

976
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:21,549
a second and we also have um mechanisms

977
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,559
for how I feels together and remodel

978
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,899
which is really a major principle and

979
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,449
how you form mushrooms right there's

980
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:30,789
there's this whole nodding and fusing of

981
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:34,779
hyphy to make well and ask them I seats

982
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:36,639
to make make the sexual structures so so

983
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,530
are what are those genes look like in

984
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,190
these species and so we and this is with

985
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,560
Gregg Jed's lab in in Singapore who's a

986
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,519
cell biologist works a lot on on some of

987
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,889
these aspects of cell biology and in in

988
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,300
neuro specially and so when we started

989
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,610
with as we said we took organisms like

990
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,620
the Ross Perot and others and we asked

991
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,930
what are the genes that are shared among

992
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:00,969
them among organisms that we would call

993
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:02,199
complex multicellular so there's lots of

994
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:04,179
genes in the genome I'm going to walk

995
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,159
through a couple of these plots this one

996
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:12,699
is a set of genes that we know are

997
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:15,069
important in in plugging holes in the

998
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:17,109
septum okay and I'm pretty sure I put

999
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,610
the figure of what this looks like in a

1000
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,710
second but these are a bunch of proteins

1001
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,230
that we know are important in separating

1002
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,059
cells and we think that separating two

1003
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,639
cell types is probably important part of

1004
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,619
that of being multicellular and so only

1005
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,000
those genes are only found in these ask

1006
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,529
on my seats are not found anything else

1007
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and then and then there are other genes

1008
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,440
that are involved in what's called this

1009
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,230
up support count which is another kind

1010
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,110
of plugging technology technology or

1011
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,730
component that fungi use again to gate

1012
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,390
their their cells in the way that we

1013
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,798
think about this is your

1014
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:49,098
marine and you've got different

1015
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:50,900
compartments and you get a you know

1016
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,059
you're in though you're in a lab and and

1017
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,410
someone brings a razor blade and cuts

1018
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:56,539
part of your hyphy and you start to

1019
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:58,038
bleed out okay if you're in the summary

1020
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:01,130
and you'd like to close off those doors

1021
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:05,089
and stop and stop this this cytoplasmic

1022
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:07,160
leakage and so there are these pores

1023
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:09,139
that can be occluded by a protein that

1024
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:10,250
prevent that leakage and the proteins

1025
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,500
that are involved in blocking those

1026
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,000
pores in ascomycete impose eyes on my

1027
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,099
Catina ask on my seats are these

1028
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,298
proteins like hacks and lesion and

1029
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,829
whiskers okay

1030
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:20,538
and there's a different set of proteins

1031
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:22,250
that are involved in that pour in

1032
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,920
basidiomycetes here they're in two

1033
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,018
independent origins of that that

1034
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,809
technology or that or that innovation

1035
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,308
and then these proteins here involved in

1036
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,019
- fusions so a lot of these do not seem

1037
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:35,089
to be found in the Elector so basically

1038
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:37,659
that end on this this is not necessarily

1039
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:40,788
showing us a component that's related to

1040
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:43,670
multicellularity from our hypothesis

1041
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:45,019
sort of starting out hypothesis and so

1042
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,450
let me just oh yeah let me just visibly

1043
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:49,068
show you again in in his eyes oh man

1044
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,969
Katina you have this sort of Iraq this

1045
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:52,068
lifeboat raft

1046
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:53,568
I must be scared of drowning I got all

1047
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:55,400
these examples here but yeah this raft

1048
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:56,929
and as there's flow through there though

1049
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,269
they get they get liberated and they

1050
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:00,618
plug the hole okay in emphasizing my

1051
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:04,250
Katina and there's a set the port cap

1052
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:05,329
that's involved in that known we wanted

1053
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,369
to know what does it look like in the

1054
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:12,200
Elector this is what it looks like under

1055
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:13,789
the e/m of that pore in the Elector so

1056
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,518
it actually makes this protein aggregate

1057
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:18,230
which is involved in plugging and i'm

1058
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:19,788
not showing the picture of this

1059
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,259
emphasize omega tina but it's similar

1060
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,759
but different in the sense that there's

1061
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:24,949
some sort of protein aggregate that's

1062
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:26,420
fitting in that hole but it's not the

1063
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:28,250
proteins that we know about it's

1064
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,599
something else novel that's gone in

1065
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,619
there and we don't know what it is yeah

1066
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,690
we've tried a couple of different things

1067
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,730
we don't actually have the protein yet

1068
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,250
but visibly you can see that it's doing

1069
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,599
that and so again just reiterating what

1070
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,940
I just said but this is what's known and

1071
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,528
in emphasize on my Katina there's this

1072
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,970
hex protein that gets decorated with

1073
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,739
these sticky things but stick together

1074
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,358
and they're involved in plugging in that

1075
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:49,189
hole and all those proteins are

1076
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,528
necessary for that and they're not found

1077
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,980
in they're only found in those besides

1078
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:55,739
on my Catina function okay so nah that's

1079
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,449
cool because

1080
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:01,739
we further confirmed that this is a

1081
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:03,659
really unique innovation at the precise

1082
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,699
oh my Katina evolved to deal with how

1083
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,118
they plug their septum so that is kind

1084
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:08,429
of cool

1085
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,710
it's not something that's older than the

1086
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:12,089
palazzo mecca team but we can look at

1087
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,619
other proteins so that I'm sort of

1088
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,910
taking you down this this big picture

1089
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,590
and there are other proteins that do

1090
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:17,879
seem to be shared among many of these

1091
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,980
but not necessarily specific to the

1092
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,769
complex multicellularity and there are

1093
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,579
some proteins that are involved in

1094
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:27,989
really old the stripe at complex is a

1095
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,219
really old complex it's really it's

1096
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,679
actually found in lots of eukaryotes

1097
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:32,909
that it's involved in development and so

1098
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,559
that's they were not surprised that it's

1099
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:36,779
basically found to be conserved a bunch

1100
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,610
of these but basically our candidate

1101
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,519
gene approach didn't necessarily pick

1102
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,320
out totally obvious things that we were

1103
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,659
hoping that would be able to tell us

1104
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,340
what's going on from there but we did

1105
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,500
use a different approach where we say

1106
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,420
can we find genes that really follow the

1107
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,400
pattern and it really really tend to be

1108
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,780
in the complex multicellular fungi and

1109
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,670
missing in things like sacrum I Caesar

1110
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,410
Canada which are single-celled and we do

1111
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,670
look at things involved in light regular

1112
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,920
light response um

1113
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,740
reactive oxygen species again also seems

1114
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,750
to be quite not completely specific to

1115
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,118
but but quite enriched and missing in

1116
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,159
the sacrum ICC's lineages that relate to

1117
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,510
reactive oxygen species and some of the

1118
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,309
genes in terms of some of the chitin

1119
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,800
synthesis involved in remodeling are

1120
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,269
only found in these species that have

1121
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,869
the complex multicellular it's not a

1122
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:23,280
perfect match but it is it is useful to

1123
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,840
look at that and so here's an example of

1124
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,820
a protein that's a septal pore

1125
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,590
associated protein that is for example

1126
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,420
female sterile so it's probably a

1127
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:34,079
protein involved in making a sexual

1128
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,369
structure in this is an Arras bruh we

1129
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,480
were able to do the experiments and we

1130
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:38,220
can show that that's an important

1131
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,440
protein that has this pattern of being

1132
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:42,509
sort of only in these two fungi and not

1133
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,450
in the others okay so we're trying to

1134
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,800
get at more than just making gene lists

1135
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,118
or actually trying to test these we have

1136
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,000
to do it in Arras probe because that's a

1137
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,760
system where we can knock out the genes

1138
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and so this is another this is a sort of

1139
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,070
a further narrow down to novel genes

1140
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,570
that seem to show this pattern so we

1141
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,980
again you have to squint a little bit we

1142
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:04,710
obviously use the sort of darker color

1143
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,358
to represent um kind of degree of

1144
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,000
conservation and so some of these

1145
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:09,599
proteins maybe not necessarily all lost

1146
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,889
in the

1147
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,079
single cell phones although some of them

1148
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:14,789
are but that but that we start to test

1149
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,980
these are these are genes that have not

1150
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:18,539
been necessary we don't know the

1151
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,010
function of them and so they so what

1152
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:21,929
Greg's but but they seem to show a

1153
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,430
pattern that's consistent with this

1154
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:24,960
complex multicellularity and so what

1155
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,549
Greg's lab that is tagged these and look

1156
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,440
at where they localize to and for

1157
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,110
example you know some of these proteins

1158
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,400
are the the details aren't so important

1159
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,440
but that that we can look at where they

1160
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,119
localize to and see that many of them

1161
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,340
are in restricted membrane domains and

1162
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,170
some of these are novel localization or

1163
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,990
a novelty associated protein with

1164
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,760
mitochondria so just the take home is

1165
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,989
this is more like a framework for it is

1166
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,820
to try to use this approach to

1167
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:50,639
prioritize genes that might be important

1168
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,559
in that process and so one final kind of

1169
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,759
example to walk through from from the

1170
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:59,039
work was that there is this um this

1171
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,590
protein that's involved in in in this

1172
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,719
dying binding and this this p150 glued

1173
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,490
protein is involved in this microtubule

1174
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,679
binding and so what's what's interesting

1175
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:09,599
is this a protein what I want you to get

1176
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,179
away from this is it's not about whether

1177
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,829
or not the gene is present or absent

1178
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,029
what's interesting about this and this

1179
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:17,549
is what this plot is showing is that

1180
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,530
there are parts of the protein which are

1181
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,180
shared among the fungi that are have

1182
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,740
complex multicellularity and they're

1183
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,480
part of the protein that are missing and

1184
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,639
the fungi that are single-celled so they

1185
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,679
still have the same gene so if you just

1186
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:32,670
go by orthology you can find it but that

1187
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:35,369
on par most of the of the species that

1188
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:37,200
don't make these complex structures have

1189
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,730
lost parts of this protein that's

1190
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,279
basically take home of this figure and

1191
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,050
this figure and so the dotted lines are

1192
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,070
the places where it's missing and those

1193
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,840
and those are involved in some the

1194
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,640
interactions and so it might be that

1195
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,559
again when you think about this we have

1196
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,819
a high fee and so some of the ideas you

1197
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,489
have to transport things along a high

1198
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,230
fee and so that's part of the need for

1199
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:57,449
some of these binding and these these

1200
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,670
proteins the the function that these

1201
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:02,460
proteins play and so i think that's a

1202
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,170
harder thing to write really good

1203
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,760
software to be able to find right this

1204
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,740
is this is an effort of really studying

1205
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,180
the protein and knowing what it did and

1206
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:12,199
knowing what parts of it were important

1207
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:14,279
in order to find a pattern like this

1208
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,480
so i mean it means are what makes our

1209
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,710
job harder we can't just sequence a

1210
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,329
genome and say the genes that are in the

1211
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,519
complex ones and not in the

1212
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:21,480
single-celled ones or the answer all

1213
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,309
right so these are but these are

1214
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,490
examples of things where i think is

1215
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,750
dig into we could we can find a better

1216
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:30,419
interpretation of the important parts

1217
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,710
okay so and this another way to look at

1218
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,930
that picture of that same asserting

1219
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,389
debts that are missing in some of these

1220
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:38,190
single-celled ones but that were the the

1221
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:39,900
Neo Lecter protein and his sister

1222
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,000
species really still have it but then it

1223
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,660
starts to get lost again and shrink in

1224
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,889
some of these single-celled ones okay so

1225
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:49,049
you may not be convinced that this is

1226
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:50,190
exactly what's happening but I think

1227
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,660
these are the these are these are the

1228
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,070
trends that we're trying to dig into

1229
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:54,000
deeper instead of just looking at

1230
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,260
presence/absence

1231
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,159
as a way to make a character

1232
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,960
characterization okay so again we can

1233
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,000
look for gene loss across a big set of

1234
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,170
species or gene gain and so for example

1235
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,570
I didn't show you example I didn't show

1236
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,340
you the data but we know that fidella

1237
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,019
were lost and species that don't have

1238
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,550
flagella and there were early lineages

1239
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,989
that do have flagella that's a very easy

1240
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,550
signal to find we can find those

1241
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,539
proteins missing and all the species

1242
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,580
that don't make fidella

1243
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,210
but we can look for other

1244
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,130
characteristics that relate to things

1245
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,769
like multicellularity and here we've got

1246
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,869
this more nuanced way of looking at it

1247
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:27,150
but we do think that we have some tools

1248
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:31,529
for being able to to jump into that okay

1249
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:33,930
so in conclusion this is the wild west

1250
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,880
of some of our work but some of our the

1251
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:37,859
Zygo life project team is a big

1252
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,230
collaboration of a lot of different labs

1253
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,200
that have been contributing the

1254
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:45,210
contribute to this and students in my

1255
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,649
lab that have been been working on

1256
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,119
different parts of this and post postdoc

1257
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:52,380
usmani who did all the NIA left to work

1258
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,179
in my group and there's the color

1259
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,070
version of that with that I will take

1260
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:57,719
and also take your kids sampling in the

1261
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,039
desert it's always fun to do he did he

1262
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,079
wasn't gonna smile for the camera but it

1263
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,460
was good so with that I will stop take

1264
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:13,110
any questions at any time and thank you

1265
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:16,619
for your attention thank you so much for

1266
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:19,950
your talk on the best organisms on the

1267
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:25,670
planet I think it was a great overview

1268
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:31,079
of phylogeny function and evolution and

1269
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:34,260
thank you so much in commemoration and

1270
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:37,518
in gratitude we have a little plaque

1271
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:44,190
thank you for the lecture series

1272
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:50,458
any questions yeah so in your analysis

1273
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:52,409
of the time in 4G no duplications how

1274
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:54,929
can you separate that from possible

1275
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:56,759
hybridization events yeah that's a Greek

1276
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:58,708
yeah that's a great question I guess we

1277
00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:01,978
would have to do a secondary set of

1278
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:03,088
analyses to try to look at the well so I

1279
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:05,818
think we should be sequencing more than

1280
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:08,639
one individual for any given species and

1281
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:10,588
that would allow us to at least add some

1282
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,288
population variation in that to see if

1283
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:14,909
the same region is oh you're thinking

1284
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:18,390
like a little bit older hybridization so

1285
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:20,639
sure I mean the mechanism by which you

1286
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:21,838
duplicated maybe doesn't have to be an

1287
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,788
endo duplication it could be a

1288
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,458
hybridization that driven eyes I think

1289
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:29,699
it's more are there more are there twice

1290
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:36,419
as many genes is the first signature and

1291
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:37,380
then you know well it depends a lot

1292
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,869
you're gonna maintain those duplicates

1293
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,579
so we do see in some species what looks

1294
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:43,199
to be diploid that then lose hetero

1295
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,579
zygosity and other kind of patterns that

1296
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,039
really suggest that you kind of it's

1297
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,900
really a diploid that does a hybrid that

1298
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,180
hybridization as opposed to really like

1299
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,130
maintaining a duplicate set of

1300
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:56,399
chromosomes so I think that's probably

1301
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:58,769
part of what we might have to tease out

1302
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,430
as to how different the alleles are in

1303
00:45:58,768 --> 00:46:06,028
those duplicates to really get at it but

1304
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:12,629
you're right there's a gradient yeah

1305
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:17,068
there's a feature finally understand how

1306
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,778
change became dedicated yeah that's a

1307
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:20,699
great question I mean I think I think

1308
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:24,719
the answer is hopefully yes we'll be

1309
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:27,358
able to get at the either the metabolism

1310
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,749
that you know requirements that have

1311
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:36,538
made them obligate or that that support

1312
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:37,618
on the obligate nature or the best way

1313
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,420
to be able to have it is you have a

1314
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,559
species that isn't obligate and to be

1315
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,759
able to compare what's different at

1316
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,949
least at that starting point so I guess

1317
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:46,199
that's where we would start from but I

1318
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:47,639
don't know that we have I haven't I

1319
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:49,229
haven't focused on the on that lineage

1320
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,159
yet there are a lot there the rust

1321
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:52,929
genomes tend to be pretty big

1322
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:54,038
which is interesting right there dere

1323
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:56,139
obligate but they're not necessarily

1324
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:58,749
like reduced and so I think trying to

1325
00:46:56,139 --> 00:47:00,998
understand some of that is still under

1326
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:19,509
ongoing as people get more more sampling

1327
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:21,458
of it I think so I think so our

1328
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:23,228
extremophiles just in one part of the

1329
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:26,338
tree basically or so there's a lot of

1330
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:28,958
the videomic seeds that represent

1331
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:31,208
represent that there are other examples

1332
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:32,948
of extremophiles depending I mean

1333
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:34,478
thermophilic extremophiles live in a

1334
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:38,889
coupler are found in different parts of

1335
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:41,228
the tree as well so cold ones so we've

1336
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,958
we've done a microbiome I TS kind of

1337
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:45,429
study and we do have what's interesting

1338
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:47,139
is you can allow lichens out of that

1339
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,538
because that's what typically is the

1340
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:51,458
biomass inside those inside those but

1341
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:53,829
when you go to do culturing you can get

1342
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:55,778
obviously see a bit more the species

1343
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,390
most of the ones that so we we do have

1344
00:47:55,778 --> 00:48:00,849
one basidiomycetes orula that seems to

1345
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:04,659
be associated with with the with the

1346
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:07,150
rocks but then it's predominantly do a

1347
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:08,889
video my seeds that were that have been

1348
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,539
put in the culture collections that were

1349
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:14,259
able to use or we've been able to kind

1350
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:16,359
of work on and there are I think there

1351
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:18,338
are some other pies on my cattiness

1352
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:20,228
other filamentous asked on my seats so

1353
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,818
that the K that K three aliens would be

1354
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:23,498
the other group where you see those as

1355
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:26,170
well which is another there are two

1356
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:29,818
groups of kind of black yeasts that and

1357
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,818
that's kind of the other the other group

1358
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,390
well I think so that's a great question

1359
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,098
I think how many times multicellularity

1360
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:59,889
evolved and fungi is you know somewhat

1361
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:01,539
debate as to whether or not what you

1362
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:03,278
define is complex multicellular so I

1363
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:05,049
mean just forming a fruiting any kind of

1364
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:07,228
complex fruiting body probably might be

1365
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:09,309
multi-cellular so we have to so that's a

1366
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:10,958
that's a debate but let's talk about

1367
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:13,149
this very specific thing that plugging

1368
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:14,348
you need septa to be able to have the

1369
00:49:13,148 --> 00:49:17,108
plugin so we don't think that the

1370
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,429
ancestor of the fungi had it we think

1371
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:21,909
that probably at least from our

1372
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:23,918
reconstruction you know that the we do

1373
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:25,509
see septa in some of the work all the

1374
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:28,208
kicks Ella mica Tina but within this I

1375
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:31,838
go my seats we do see one other example

1376
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:33,308
of septa Bob we haven't we don't know

1377
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,880
anything about the pore structure there

1378
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:38,259
so I don't I don't anyways um but we but

1379
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,358
because of this look at work at nee

1380
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:42,398
electa we can at least say there's three

1381
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:43,778
origins of that kind of plugging in the

1382
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:46,298
examples that we've looked at there

1383
00:49:43,778 --> 00:49:47,708
which is more than before where we would

1384
00:49:46,298 --> 00:49:50,168
have just said to and previously we'd

1385
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:51,548
say that the dike area fungi so the

1386
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:53,699
ancestor they ask of my seats in the

1387
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:56,380
city of my seats must not have had that

1388
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,389
because we independently evolved it to

1389
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,398
different ways so that might mean that

1390
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:02,768
the ancestor of Icaria didn't really

1391
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:05,978
have septa true septal need for true

1392
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:07,928
septal pores until later because of that

1393
00:50:05,978 --> 00:50:10,118
that I mean that's the parsimonious

1394
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:11,979
interpretation of that unless there's

1395
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:27,639
some gain loss thing that we you know

1396
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:29,588
it's really rapid yeah I think so I

1397
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:31,059
think that yeah so I think that's a

1398
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:32,798
final my Catina probably represent that

1399
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:34,749
in that you see simplification and we

1400
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:36,369
think sacra Micah T we look at the tree

1401
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:38,018
sacrament Catina represents a

1402
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:39,489
simplification to so probably the

1403
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:41,348
ancestor of sacrum ice sheets a car

1404
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:43,528
Micah teen and sacrum Isis had more it

1405
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:45,759
was more complex and then you've seen

1406
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:48,338
simplification or law that the genomes

1407
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:50,769
are smaller and and they they have fewer

1408
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:52,298
so well encoding genes a lot of things

1409
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:53,708
that might be involved in that process

1410
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:55,838
they don't have these Highfill fusion

1411
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:57,448
genes that are shared so I think that

1412
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,318
yeah we do think that it's actually

1413
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:00,789
simplification or however you wanted to

1414
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:02,858
you know that sort of has a loaded term

1415
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:07,719
but like losses are driving some of that

1416
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:13,798
but yeah this is one other point that

1417
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:20,519
was that yeah there's a wealth of data

1418
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:20,518
genetic data with yeah

1419
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:32,170
yes how well does that data form well I

1420
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:35,179
mean in one part we've lit we we are

1421
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:36,500
still probably working on integration of

1422
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,940
those data in the right way so there's

1423
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,769
been sort of siloed you know there's a

1424
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,570
really good sacrum ICC's data set

1425
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:43,610
database and ability to look at gene

1426
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:47,090
function in those and we can map those

1427
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,260
on to a neurology and ask their is there

1428
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,850
good evidence they have the same

1429
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,450
function or they're part of the same

1430
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:51,949
process

1431
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:54,439
although sometimes that's a circular and

1432
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:56,210
inference because the annotation inner

1433
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,119
officer might be driven from the sacrum

1434
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,619
ICC's homolog but um in terms of how it

1435
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,339
maps on the file I don't know that we've

1436
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,960
really looked at in terms of

1437
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,329
phylogenetically I think we just tried

1438
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,250
to ask are there consistency between

1439
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:08,480
them probably the best place where it's

1440
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,719
been done is like there's a systematic

1441
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,579
knockout set in palm B and then sacrum I

1442
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:16,039
sees right and so in that's a case where

1443
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:19,159
you'd want to ask for each fourth log is

1444
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:21,019
the is the phenotype pretty similar or

1445
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:23,179
not in an Arras borough we have a

1446
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:25,940
systemic knockout collection but they've

1447
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:29,599
not been all phenotyped and so probably

1448
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,289
about 1,500 to 2,000 have really been

1449
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,150
phenotyped

1450
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:33,980
out of that 10,000 knockout collection

1451
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:36,349
so I think that's what's limiting it

1452
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,400
right now is really to systematically

1453
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:39,949
have that so people are doing like

1454
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,720
growth rate and sexual reproduction and

1455
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:44,299
a few other things are being scored but

1456
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:45,739
I wouldn't say it's actually the

1457
00:52:44,300 --> 00:53:05,630
resources are there but I'm not sure all

1458
00:52:45,739 --> 00:53:07,189
of its been so the short answer is no I

1459
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,960
have not looked at that there are a

1460
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,909
couple labs that have been focused on

1461
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,980
mitochondrial evolution more focused on

1462
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:17,329
some of the early the kids and the Zygo

1463
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,710
might see fungi then and others so it's

1464
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:20,599
definitely an open question I guess the

1465
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,039
short answer is it needs better work I

1466
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,079
think there's not enough people we've

1467
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,309
really delved into it um sometimes with

1468
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,069
the genome assemblies it takes a little

1469
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:29,690
extra effort to pool the mitochondrial

1470
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,760
reads and called that assembly it's not

1471
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,550
actually too hard but it hasn't probably

1472
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,310
been done in a system

1473
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:38,310
as it should be so I think it's kind of

1474
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:54,690
an open space that hasn't gotten as much

1475
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:56,789
attention right it's a good question I

1476
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,050
mean I don't know if inheritance of

1477
00:53:56,789 --> 00:54:00,650
mitochondria is an interesting question

1478
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:02,700
and sort of who which parent donates in

1479
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,139
and in the interactions between the

1480
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:05,189
nuclear genome and the mitochondria Ms

1481
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:08,069
def there definitely are interesting

1482
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,440
experiments mostly in like multinucleate

1483
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,940
the city of my seeds in sort of tracking

1484
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,460
things too so there are interesting

1485
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,900
research questions about those

1486
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,320
interactions but I don't know that like

1487
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,090
a systematic here's all the mitochondria

1488
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,470
and their content and what's been gained

1489
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,570
and lost they're sort of like individual

1490
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:27,119
examples of like intron gain and loss

1491
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,250
and some of those and but but yeah I

1492
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,789
think it's I think it's an open space

1493
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:42,239
that someone needs more thank you very

1494
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:45,869
much this has been a production of

1495
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:48,559
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1496
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:48,559
