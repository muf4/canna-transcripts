1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,679
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,000
University hi I'm Frank Rossy um I'm

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,278
going to introduce myself as an urban

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
grassland

5
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:21,079
ecologist for the purposes of this um

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,640
like this the Earth is warming it's our

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:27,959
fault uh we are as we've seen and Grant

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,320
showed moving into cities at rapid rates

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,278
which is a good thing because then we

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,000
only mess up small amounts of area every

11
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,558
place we go we tend to uh mess things up

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,039
as a population and one of the things

13
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,839
that we know is as we move into these

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,519
Urban environments and I know my

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,160
colleague Nina basic has been barking

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
about this for 40 years and hardly

17
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,959
anybody's been listening but it's very

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,759
important to have plants and green

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,520
infrastructures in these uh systems as

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,039
Yoshi said very well to start us off

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,239
today uh not growing food but supplying

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,439
us in different ways so it's really

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,599
important uh that we have these green

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,518
infrastructure rues there the problem is

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,879
people can't be trusted to take care of

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:10,280
them they mismanage nutrients they mow

27
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:14,079
improperly they uh don't Steward the

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,920
Water Resource uh exceptionally well um

29
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,478
there's enormous amounts of emissions

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,879
associated with their use they don't

31
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:22,400
know how to deal with uh organic waste

32
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,319
let me uh never mind their adherence to

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Pest management principles so these

34
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,118
improper practices are uh all lead

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,879
leading to a reduction in ecosystem

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,680
services and that really is

37
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,560
fundamentally what is no longer a let

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
net laughing matter how these Landscapes

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,719
provide and regulate and support and in

40
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,679
my perspective are offer all these

41
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,280
cultural Services the human well-being

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,079
the recreation that uh Urban grasslands

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,159
pen provide so our research is focusing

44
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:54,478
on Diversified plantings mixing C3 and

45
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,200
C4 plants in lawns in hopes that it can

46
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,239
be a little bit smarter when the water

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,000
comes and goes that's one approach the

48
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,000
other is to take the people out because

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,359
in my opinion they can't be trusted is

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,560
to automate those Landscapes and we have

51
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,280
as the $6 million man who's old enough

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,120
you know anybody my age would remember

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,479
that television show we have the

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,519
technology to do this now it's a matter

55
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,039
of making it work and systematizing it

56
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,480
so that works on a smartphone and so we

57
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,159
have an array of robotic mowing

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,598
Technologies and an array of irrigation

59
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,878
moisture sensing Technologies the

60
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,759
ability to hand the keys of the mowing

61
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,000
over to the robot which will be better

62
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,399
than a regular person Mowing and turn

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,878
the keys of the irrigation system over

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,640
to the uh soil moisture sensors after

65
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,598
they're calibrated so that the water can

66
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,919
be applied properly and in conjunction

67
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,238
what that will then lead to you know is

68
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,598
sort of like driverless cars right the

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,519
roads are going to have to be a little

70
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,199
bit different the uh roads will be used

71
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,319
more efficiently and will all be quite a

72
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,479
bit safer when humans aren't driving and

73
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,199
in My Hope just like it might be illegal

74
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,518
some day to drive a car I hope it's

75
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,518
illegal to mow your

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,799
lawn this has been a production of
