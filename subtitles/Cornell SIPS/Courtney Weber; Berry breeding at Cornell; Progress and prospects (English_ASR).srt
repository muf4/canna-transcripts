1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,480
University thank you

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,960
Don so obviously we're going to talk a

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,400
little bit about berries today that's

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,760
what I do and that's what I've been

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,518
doing at Cornell now for 17 years um so

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,600
I work in actually several different

8
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:26,079
species as you can see up here

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,080
raspberries strawberries and

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,399
blackberries so Cornell has a long

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,439
history of work in berries uh at the

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,719
station opened in 1882 and berries were

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,000
one of the first fields that were

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
planted that first year at the station

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,280
in Geneva uh of course at that time the

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
station was an independent unit was not

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,359
part of Cornell but did join Cornell in

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,359
1923 and that that uh program has been

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,878
maintained through that time we are the

20
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,000
oldest Berry breeding program in the

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,679
United States and as far as we

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,359
continuously uh active as far as I can

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,039
tell we're the oldest continuously

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,519
active program in the world but those

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,439
stats are a little hard to come by so

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:08,798
there may be some dispute there um over

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,438
that time our program has developed 41

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,360
different raspberry varieties three of

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,399
which I have named and and patented you

30
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,239
can see them there we've also developed

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,400
43 strawberry varieties over that time

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,039
uh the 43rd one coming out today being

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,000
announced today in in the chronicle um

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,320
we did plan that a little bit so uh but

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,840
so generally and then there has been

36
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,438
some some Blackberry varieties there's

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,159
been little work in blackberries mainly

38
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:37,919
because New York is generally too cold

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,479
to consistently grow blackberries but

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,240
that's changing with some new genetics

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,239
that we're using in

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,758
blackberries so my program and my

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,478
appointment is research and extension um

44
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,879
we have a very diverse set of of

45
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,478
clientele that we work for that we try

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,879
to help certainly the home gardeners

47
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,078
gardening is the number one um Hobby in

48
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,118
the United States of course can be done

49
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,839
by people of all ages and people

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,799
continue to do it through throughout

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,399
their lives and so our varieties are

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,000
certainly many of them are suitable for

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,878
home gardeners and they really love

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
berries there's nothing be nothing

55
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,239
better than a berry out of your backyard

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
it will be the best tasting Berry you'll

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,920
ever get that said you can't grow

58
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,000
berries in your backyard all the

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,119
time so we have the people that cater to

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,719
those home gardeners certainly the

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,680
retail nurseries these are companies

62
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,120
like Burpee Seed Company sell our

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
varieties uh the gardens alive company

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,519
which is gurny and Michigan Bulb Company

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,959
and uh some of those other catalog

66
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,920
companies that sell directly to the

67
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,239
retail Market uh generally small numbers

68
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,280
high price per

69
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,280
plant uh you get into the commercial

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,640
nurseries you might recognize nurseries

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,080
like Norse farms uh Crone farms in

72
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,000
Michigan there's a lot of berry

73
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,120
nurseries around the country um we work

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
directly with them uh with our varieties

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
licensing our varieties but also working

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,360
with them with new material they

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,759
propagate some of our material

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,239
to give out to Growers for grower trials

79
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,598
before they're released and so we have a

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
very good relationship with many of

81
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,280
these Growers around the

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,879
country and then the commercial

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
producers both domestic and

84
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,719
international we work directly with the

85
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,518
New York State Berry grows Association

86
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,318
they provide uh member Growers who will

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,640
test some of our material before it make

88
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,919
it to the marketplace um as well as

89
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,318
larger companies in California that want

90
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,238
to see things pre-commercialization so

91
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,798
they can be ahead of the game when it

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,840
when it comes out out we have

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,239
international cooperation as well so we

94
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,039
have we have exclusive contracts in

95
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,799
Mexico in Europe um and we're working on

96
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,959
a few other countries so that they can

97
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,000
see our material very quickly and if

98
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,000
there's something they like they can

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,199
bring it to the market before everybody

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,639
else and they can have it for their own

101
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,639
um for their own programs for their own

102
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,799
production so in the extension side of

103
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,119
things we do things like variety trials

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,360
generally and a lot of protect

105
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,438
production technology uh research um I

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,480
worked quite a bit with Marvin of course

107
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,199
on that Marvin pritz on that area this

108
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,039
was a project um that Marvin LED on low

109
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,878
Tunnels for strawberries uh with day

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,120
neutral to extend the season it's been

111
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,159
very very successful and the berries

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,319
look really good under the system

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
um and we really we think it's a very

114
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,040
good option for the New York grower so

115
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,040
right now there are strawberries

116
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,400
available underneath these low tunnels

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,000
people are still picking strawberries

118
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,519
where they have them and they can pick

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,279
strawberries through through generally

120
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,758
through the mid November is how we find

121
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,599
it um often we just run out of berries

122
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,240
as it cools down but the quality and the

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,680
and the uh the season extension is

124
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
really great using some of these things

125
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,360
uh of course we have we started using

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,519
High tunnels at the station in 2008 we

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,840
put up our first set of about a half an

128
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,680
acre of these are Hay grve High tunnels

129
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,839
you can see they're multe Bay they're

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,560
interconnected these are seasonal so the

131
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,560
plastic comes off in the winter time and

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,959
goes back up in the spring and for

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,879
raspberries these this step in

134
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,519
production technology has really changed

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,800
the raspberry industry all it does is

136
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,839
keep the rain off but a raspberry that

137
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,280
gets rained on in the field has a shelf

138
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,119
life of about two days takes four days

139
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,038
by truck to get from California to New

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,038
York so if they get rained on even

141
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:18,839
though it doesn't rain a lot in

142
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,079
California it does rain sometimes

143
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,318
although in the last few years not very

144
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,240
often um those fruit are

145
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,120
unsellable put them under tunnels where

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,720
they don't get wet you get a shelf life

147
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,600
of 10 to 12 days so there aren't very

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
many technology you can use to get a 5

149
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,800
to 600% increase in your shelf life so

150
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,198
it's really important for raspberries

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
because they're so perishable um we also

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,439
find the plants grow better the fruits

153
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,918
bigger and the yields are higher all

154
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,959
good things but you have to irate you do

155
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,959
have to irrigate um for the commercial

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,399
market for the supermarket in California

157
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,439
all raspberries are grown under high

158
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,799
tunnels there is no open field

159
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,639
production that's that way they can

160
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,199
guarantee the quality and they can Prov

161
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,079
provide a consistent product that we

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,079
expect to see in the supermarkets every

163
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,598
day

164
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:11,879
now doesn't always work out the way you

165
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,519
like this is Hurricane Ike in 2008 about

166
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,038
a day and a half after we finished

167
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,478
putting the plastic

168
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,000
on and uh it came right over the top of

169
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,199
us 70 mph winds and tore it up pretty

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
good um two weeks later we had it

171
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,160
rebuilt put back together so it looked

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,919
really bad that day we disassembled it

173
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,000
parts that were bent straightened some

174
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,519
of them out replace some of them and we

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,279
were back in business in a few days so

176
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,439
um it really did look bad Monday morning

177
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,758
though coming to work it was pretty

178
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,199
disheartening we hold field days then

179
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,400
some of the variety trials we have all

180
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,478
the fruit might as well bring people in

181
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,598
to taste it so we put you can see we put

182
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,639
all this fruit out so that people can

183
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,079
sample it see the difference between the

184
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,120
varieties Growers come in they see how

185
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,000
we're growing it it's just a way to get

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,879
direct Outreach and to get direct input

187
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,519
from the grower on what they like so um

188
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,039
some of you came early you saw in the

189
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,279
back I put out some raspberries you saw

190
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,839
there was a little score sheet too I

191
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,198
figured I have a captive audience I

192
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,279
might as well get some information out

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,840
of it um but that's the type of thing

194
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,519
we'll do we'll provide grower samples

195
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,839
let them taste them let them rate them

196
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,399
on what they think about raspberries or

197
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:26,279
strawberries too and it turns out people

198
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,120
don't all like the same thing um

199
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,679
generally the good tasting varieties do

200
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,598
separate out that most people like um

201
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,360
and then there's often the outliers

202
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,079
people who like tart berries the really

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,000
sour ones and that's fairly common in

204
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,598
raspberries to have acidic fruit that is

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,360
that is tart in flavor um but generally

206
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:48,918
the market has moved towards sweet um so

207
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,680
higher sugar um bigger and redder uh

208
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,359
hopefully Colin was able to bring some

209
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,959
fruit down in Geneva and they got some

210
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,680
to eat I don't I didn't put any score

211
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,478
sheets out for them but I didn't didn't

212
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
want to leave you out for fruit if

213
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,318
you're not seeing it it should be there

214
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,759
in a Colin didn't bring it then I'll

215
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,000
talk to him later uh Colin is my

216
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,158
technician so it's my how I get anything

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,360
done a little bit about the statistics

218
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,478
of berries since I've been at Cornell so

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
when I came to Cornell the strawberry

220
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,359
industry in the United States as a whole

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,879
was about a$1 billion industry on about

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,639
46,000 Acres the vast majority of those

223
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,280
acreages are in California that part has

224
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,918
not changed now there's about 59,000

225
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,239
Acres this was 2015 data um 40,000 of

226
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,759
those Acres

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,158
California the other 19,000 acres are

228
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,838
spread across the country about half of

229
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,759
that in Florida and the rest spread out

230
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,919
um around the country New York is is

231
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,838
fifth in production um in acreage in

232
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,159
Strawberry production in the US and that

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,000
is a very small fifth um $2.2 billion in

234
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,559
the US in Farmgate value 1.8 billion of

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,080
that comes out of California it gives

236
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,439
you an idea of the scope of the industry

237
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,920
there it is a yearr round industry there

238
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,920
they are producing strawberries pretty

239
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,479
much somewhere in California pretty much

240
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,479
year round

241
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,239
now raspberries is really where we've

242
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,200
seen the the real dramatic changes since

243
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,720
I've been here so in 2000 or in 1999 the

244
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,320
process industry has stayed the same

245
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,399
that's pretty much Washington a little

246
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,240
bit in Oregon um the values has gone up

247
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,078
a little bit you see 104 million uh in

248
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,560
2015 on a slightly fewer AC that is a

249
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,039
machine harvested industry for Frozen

250
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,599
primarily um it's very concentrated on

251
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,078
three or four varieties that they use um

252
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,600
summer produced in the summer with a

253
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,919
very spe specific training system for

254
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,120
the machine Harvest where we see the

255
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,078
real Advance is in the The Fresh Market

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,799
in 1999 California had about 1,800 acres

257
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,239
of raspberries in 2015 it was up to

258
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,240
8,800 acres for Fresh Market raspberries

259
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,600
the USDA only takes statistics on

260
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,079
California that tells you what the rest

261
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,360
of the country doesn't even register in

262
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:07,679
their statistics um and the value has

263
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,240
risen from 31 million in 1999 to 400

264
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,239
almost $500 million worth out of

265
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,240
California um and that's just California

266
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,799
if you think about where raspberries and

267
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,959
strawberries are grown we have Mexico

268
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,278
just to the South and there's a

269
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,879
tremendous amount of fruit that comes

270
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,879
from there as

271
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,680
well as far as New York the industry has

272
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:32,639
been flat for the pretty much um the

273
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:36,719
last 20 years worth of of Statistics uh

274
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:39,679
in 99 we had about 1,600 acres in 2015

275
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,480
they only registered 960 Acres across

276
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,199
the region that is the top states that

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,480
produce the varieties that we produce

278
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,560
here and that cold climate uh Michigan

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,240
Ohio Pennsylvania and such was about um

280
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,278
6,800 acres in 99 now only about 3,800

281
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,720
Acres as far as the statistics that

282
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,200
collects are concerned the value stayed

283
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,079
pretty much the

284
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,959
same so what's changed obviously

285
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,199
raspberries we have seen a five-fold

286
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,679
increase in acreage and a 15-fold

287
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,720
increase in value in fresh red

288
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,199
raspberries and it is specifically fresh

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,920
red raspberries we're talking about um

290
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,440
and now they are shipped you go to any

291
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,519
Supermarket pretty much any day of the

292
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
year you'll see raspberries of course

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,560
you know the names driscolls is the

294
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,240
biggest name in raspberries and they are

295
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,239
have driven that industry

296
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,000
tremendously uh there's uh increased

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,879
Berry production in Mexico as well the

298
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,639
vast majority of blackberries are coming

299
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,480
out of Mexico there's a particular

300
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,480
variety that works very well can be

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,759
manipulated to produce fruit most of the

302
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,278
year um of course labor is is very

303
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,078
affordable there and they can ship the

304
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,360
berries they hold very well and they're

305
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,199
shipping them into the us but in the US

306
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Blackberry production has not increased

307
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,879
nearly as much as the other berries um

308
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,879
although we're starting to see that

309
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,919
change the thing that's changed for New

310
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,599
York is the locally grown movement um in

311
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,799
99 there were only about or in 2000

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
there was only about 230 farmers markets

313
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,278
only I say in New York now there's over

314
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,519
500 and that Trend continues Nationwide

315
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,679
that Trend continues as well over 7800

316
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,720
farmers markets you go to farmers

317
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,198
markets in this area there's almost

318
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,320
always berries locally grown but those

319
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,278
acreages are rarely caught in the

320
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,278
statistics because they're very small

321
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,720
acreages a half acre uh a quarter acre a

322
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,519
quarter acre of raspberries could be a

323
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,320
lot of raspberries to take care of and

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,159
so sometimes they don't even make it

325
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,278
into the statistics because when those

326
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,039
sheets come out that they have to fill

327
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,078
out and they're growing 14 different

328
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,639
crops because they've got green beans

329
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,879
and they've got pumpkins and they've got

330
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,639
sweet corn and they've got everything

331
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,198
else they're growing the berries don't

332
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,198
even register on their on their

333
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,679
statistics so we know people are growing

334
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,679
berries in New York our berry growing

335
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,919
beginning Berry growing workshops that

336
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,759
we hold are packed with people excited

337
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,919
about out growing berries you can do it

338
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,519
on a very small scale and still produce

339
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,519
enough berries to have some money to

340
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,240
make some money and so it's just one one

341
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,399
crop within a many crops that uh many of

342
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,919
these farmers are

343
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,919
growing so these small grower statistics

344
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:21,719
are really difficult to capture um in

345
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,838
the usda's overall statistic

346
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,639
picture the other thing that's changed

347
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,199
then with these farmers markets and the

348
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,799
locally grown movement is that people

349
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:30,439
are more interested in distinctive

350
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,198
variet ities for these

351
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,440
markets the supermarket has gone towards

352
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,078
one thing big and red that's what they

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,839
want big red raspberries big red

354
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,479
strawberries and that's pretty much

355
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,480
where the marketplace is when you go to

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,320
the supermarket you know they look great

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,039
in the container but sometimes the

358
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,560
eating quality is not where you'd really

359
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:50,360
like it when you go to a farmers market

360
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,319
you want a high quality Berry you want a

361
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,240
high FL flavor Berry and you don't want

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,759
what you can get in the supermarket if I

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,039
want a big red raspberry that doesn't

364
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,320
taste very good I can go to the

365
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,679
supermarket so when people go to farm

366
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,720
Market sometimes they want something a

367
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,599
little different so in my program and of

368
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,639
course we still want to produce a big

369
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,680
red raspberry because our California

370
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
collaborators they still want those for

371
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,479
the supermarket so this is a variety we

372
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,720
put out a few years ago big and red

373
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,159
flavors adequate ships very well um so

374
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,480
you got to balance what you're trying to

375
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,000
do with the variety you know with

376
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,959
strawberries this is Archer if you

377
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,198
haven't you'll see some pictures in it

378
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,879
in Crown it's a very large red berry

379
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,639
this one happens to be very high flavor

380
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,078
as well it's a little softer than what

381
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,639
you'll find in the supermarket so we're

382
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,679
hoping for the local market people will

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,799
enjoy this as well nice to pick fills

384
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:42,399
containers really fast people really

385
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:44,679
like that um both for upick and for uh

386
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,839
pre-picked but we also have some darker

387
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,198
berries that we've put out so here

388
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,959
you'll see on on my right is purple

389
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,519
Wonder that's being sold through Burpee

390
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,198
it's much darker than you an average

391
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,519
strawberry would be and that color

392
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,838
carries through all the way through the

393
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,320
flesh so it is a dark fleshed Berry as

394
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
well the juice comes out of it looking

395
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,519
like wine it's that that

396
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,879
dark um but the commercial Market really

397
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,480
doesn't know what to do with something

398
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,360
like that it doesn't fit into any of

399
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,519
their marketing schemes so you see

400
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,000
Burpee has a nice display on it at their

401
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,480
website as you'll notice over here

402
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,399
they're selling them for $10.95 a piece

403
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,278
per plant a commercial grower grows buys

404
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:31,159
strawberry plants for

405
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:33,720
about 13 to 15 15 cents a piece so it

406
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:36,679
gives you an idea what the retail Market

407
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,480
will bear when it comes to Specialty uh

408
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,159
varieties I had no part in deciding what

409
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
the cost of these would be Burpy did

410
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,600
that on their own but uh we get a very

411
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,120
small portion of that as royalties back

412
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,519
to the to the university Courtney I'm

413
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,198
sorry but why why can that not be

414
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,560
shipped to all of those states there

415
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,919
are regulations on shipping plants

416
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,318
sometimes

417
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,759
uh California certainly has a lot of

418
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:06,318
regulations on you can't ship certain

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,440
species I don't know about all of these

420
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:12,159
states um some of those are not

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,240
States so there must be some some uh

422
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,919
territories involved there as well and

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,720
it may be they don't want to ship some

424
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,599
of these places as well but uh certainly

425
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,759
California you have to inspect plants

426
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,240
for instance for um Japanese beetles

427
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
before you can ship plants there so

428
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,839
there are there are things like that

429
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,799
that would be my my guess there

430
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,480
we also have a white strawberry um so

431
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,519
that's one there there you see in the

432
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,560
catalog is listed as Pineberry um white

433
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,560
flesh red seeds tastes like a strawberry

434
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,758
really just a novelty but it's

435
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,479
interesting um really not something for

436
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,000
the commercial market for the for the

437
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,360
retail Market it fits something that

438
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,078
people like to do because they like to

439
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,318
Tinker in their Gardens they like to

440
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,838
pick stuff and show their neighbors look

441
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,318
what I did you know you've never seen

442
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,240
anything like this so it's very popular

443
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,759
in that kind of Market but again it's a

444
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,000
very small portion of what we

445
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,519
do some of the darker raspberries crims

446
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,119
of night that was the one I put over on

447
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,078
the table with the refreshments dark FL

448
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,838
dark fruited very sweet uh freezes very

449
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,519
well much darker than what you see in

450
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,240
the supermarket and then a peach colored

451
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,439
one double gold again novelty it's what

452
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
people like flavors very high it's a

453
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,199
little on the soft side if you had some

454
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,119
back there um so it doesn't ship

455
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,798
particularly well but it eats well and

456
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,279
people really like it and it in your

457
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,200
backyard it's very interesting um to

458
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,200
look at as well as

459
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,960
eat we work a little bit in purple

460
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,519
primarily we're working in purple

461
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,440
because we're trying to transfer traits

462
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,960
from Red into purple into black sorry

463
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,840
when you cross a black raspberry and a

464
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,120
red raspberry the fruit's

465
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,519
purple so we're trying to transfer

466
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,319
thornless which we have done and we're

467
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,279
trying to transfer fall bearing as well

468
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,079
which is in the middle stages for that

469
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,440
so some of the stuff we're looking at

470
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,639
but if we were to get get a purple that

471
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,720
was interesting we'd certainly be there

472
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,600
is some market for it in in the retail

473
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,319
Market yellow there's lesser interest in

474
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,678
yellow pretty much a novelty makes it

475
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,439
look interesting when you have a fruit

476
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,080
salad but they pretty much taste like

477
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,798
red raspberri so most people will choose

478
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,558
red when you give but we want to put out

479
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,240
a yellow one just to have a a complete

480
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,399
Suite of

481
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,319
varieties this is not one we're working

482
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,120
on this is what you'll find on the

483
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,200
internet people say oh I want blue

484
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,199
raspberry flavor it's like that's not a

485
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,080
real

486
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,159
flavor so these are not the kind of

487
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,720
berries we're growing and we really wish

488
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,400
that blue raspberry flavor would go away

489
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,880
but it is something I actually do get

490
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,080
asked about fairly

491
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,280
often so the breeding program today is

492
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,798
traditional breeding we cross breed we

493
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,240
choose parents transfer pollen collect

494
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,798
seed grow out plants it's a very

495
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,279
straightforward process that's been

496
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,879
going on for centuries um we work in

497
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,798
Strawberry both short day which are

498
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,880
their June bears we grow mostly in New

499
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,558
York and the day neutral that more

500
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,760
interest that will provide that ex

501
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,960
season extension in those low tunnels um

502
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,839
raspberry both black and red again

503
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,720
Floric cane is for summer production

504
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,839
start somewhere in June will produce

505
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
through most of July and primac Cane

506
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:20,519
starting in July and produce into the

507
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,759
fall through uh till it gets too cold

508
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,400
with Blackberry I mentioned traditional

509
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,759
blackberries fruit in the summer they

510
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,360
don't do well in New York because they

511
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,519
generally freeze the canes freeze you

512
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,240
don't get reliable crop so what John

513
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,879
John Clark at University of Arkansas

514
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,519
started this a number of years ago to

515
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,840
work with blackberries that would fruit

516
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,400
in the fall so you can avoid winter and

517
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,038
we've been doing some work with him and

518
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,880
now on our own to bring that flowering

519
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,640
time early enough into the season so

520
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
that we can flower in July and August

521
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,679
and have fruit in August September

522
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,359
October uh for blackberries and the

523
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,880
blackberries I brought back there today

524
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,678
were picked yesterday so we're uh some

525
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
of the new selections from the program

526
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,919
are in full Harvest and we're we're

527
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,519
getting a very nice product um yield is

528
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,960
still a little bit on the low side it's

529
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,679
something we're working on but some

530
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,919
yield is better than no yield which is

531
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,200
what we generally get with Summer

532
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,200
bearing types um so expect to see more

533
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Blackberry production in the in the

534
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,360
northern climates in the coming in the

535
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,279
coming years and they're starting to

536
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,000
adapt this to these types of varieties

537
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,158
in California as well for Blackberry

538
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,079
production so they can time the

539
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,520
plantings to get fruit at a certain

540
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,359
number of days after planting on the

541
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,319
current Year's growth without a dormy

542
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,079
period and that's really the advance you

543
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,200
don't need

544
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,879
dormy uh we'll talk a little bit then

545
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,759
you very faint uh some of molecular

546
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,679
genetic projects is the other side of

547
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,319
the program so I thought I I I get asked

548
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,840
a lot about you know how long does it

549
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,678
take to get a variety out you know what

550
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,038
is the process so I thought I'd walk you

551
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,480
through what we did with archer my

552
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,158
newest strawberry uh and it is a it can

553
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,038
be a long process so the Archer was a

554
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,200
selection I made very early in my career

555
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,119
here at Cornell and it was done very

556
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,798
much in the traditional sense of things

557
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,879
and so you'll see every step was done

558
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,158
through the field on a year-by-year

559
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
basis and it takes a long time doing it

560
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:10,080
that way so we've got some strategies

561
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
we've worked on and we'll I'll talk

562
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,798
about how we've been speeding that up

563
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,759
but this is how Archer started so in 99

564
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,679
we made some some crosses made some

565
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,200
hybridizations I didn't have a lot of

566
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,400
information to go on I hadn't worked on

567
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,919
berries for very long but we had the

568
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,720
records from my P from the past breeder

569
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,320
and we made some crosses collected the

570
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,000
seed in 2000 that seed got treated and

571
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,960
got planted out into the

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,240
field and you just grow them in the

573
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,600
field so we planted them in rows and let

574
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,798
them grow those have to grow a year go

575
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,038
through winter the next spring we get to

576
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,038
see

577
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,199
fruit now we've cleaned that up a little

578
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,038
bit and we use plastic we put them on

579
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,600
plastic to help with weed control but

580
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,319
the process is generally the same we put

581
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,038
them in the ground one spring the next

582
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:58,798
spring we get to see fruit um helps as

583
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,158
well we use a little bit of raised beds

584
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,720
when you get a lot of water this year

585
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
that didn't happen but last year we had

586
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,240
water it was so high it went almost over

587
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,959
the beds so from some years we get a lot

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,038
of rain and some years you get none but

589
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,400
you can't know that in

590
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:17,839
advance um so in 2001 we made the

591
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,798
selection so this is a 2001 selection I

592
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,678
made some notes that day when I selected

593
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,079
it it's a huge King Berry often the

594
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
primary Berry that comes off of

595
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,599
strawberry in the industry they'll call

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,640
it the

597
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,879
kingberry um I put very large Q well I

598
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,278
use the term queenberry as well rather

599
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,278
than secondary because it's easier to

600
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,278
write but that's not generally used in

601
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,839
the

602
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:39,839
industry um and I wrote that it was firm

603
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,879
good interior color good flavor tart

604
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,678
that's what I had to go on I made some

605
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,840
notes that day and I picked three fruit

606
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,798
a primary Berry a ter a secondary Berry

607
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,558
and a tertiary Berry you add those up

608
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,519
it's almost 100 grams of fruit so I

609
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,720
calculated if you took 100 gram of fruit

610
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,079
which is only three berries per plant on

611
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,679
a per acre basis that's over 4,000 lb

612
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,038
each plant produces more than three

613
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,200
fruit um so this is the kind of thing

614
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,079
when we see this kind of thing we're

615
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,960
like wow we got yield right away because

616
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,119
we got a lot of fruit size it comes off

617
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,400
very quickly it comes off at once and

618
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,359
for us to have a tertiary Berry in the

619
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,840
16 G size is a very good Berry in the

620
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,759
marketplace 25 will get you about this

621
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,678
big 55 or 50 grams will be about the

622
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,879
size of a plum it's a very large Berry

623
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,000
that's larger than what you normally see

624
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,679
um and we like we'll pick berries down

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,480
to about 8 to 10 G is acceptable for a

626
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,120
commercial product um so that year we

627
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,159
had one plant that's all there is is one

628
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,119
plant from that one seed so whatever

629
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,600
Runners It produced we collected those

630
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,759
Runners rooted them and start and and

631
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,079
there's a picture from that first plant

632
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,440
they're not the prettiest thing CU I'm

633
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,480
out there holding them with one hand

634
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,080
taking a picture with the other so it's

635
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,880
really not I'm not a photographer but

636
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,879
it's for me it gets it in my head so I

637
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,880
can look back and say oh I remember that

638
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,200
one and that's what we do to have a

639
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,320
picture kind of a record as we

640
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,519
go you start a plot took a year to make

641
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,879
the runners then you plant them again

642
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,319
you got to wait another year before they

643
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,960
fruit again so that takes a year we

644
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,240
planted um and then we look at it for

645
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,919
two or three years because we want to

646
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,558
see is it going to live is it going to

647
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,480
have some disease that wipes it out in

648
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,720
the first second year is the fruit going

649
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,038
to grow are the plants going to grow are

650
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,679
they going to produce Runners so we

651
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,079
collect more Runners from the next plot

652
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,440
and then you plant another plot and you

653
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,158
do it again to make sure cuz you got to

654
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,679
plant it in different locations to make

655
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
sure you didn't plant it in the best

656
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,278
possible location and it was great but

657
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,399
in a bad location it's going to die very

658
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,640
quickly so we planted multiple plots in

659
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,278
different locations so that we can see

660
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,200
this over

661
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,759
time and then you have to evaluate it

662
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
for several years to see how it comes

663
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,319
through winter to see how the plants

664
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,759
grow will they persist in the field will

665
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,759
it have a good yield every year it takes

666
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,079
time to go through this and it can

667
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,359
really take a long time and during that

668
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,000
way most of the selection

669
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,639
get slued off they're found wanting for

670
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,159
whatever reason they're susceptible to

671
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,320
some disease they don't produce enough

672
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,880
Runners the fruit quality declines over

673
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,519
time these are things that you

674
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,159
see we take more pictures so we want to

675
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,200
make sure we're planting the same plant

676
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,080
every time and that when you it produces

677
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,880
fruit the fruit looks like what we think

678
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,000
it's supposed to look like so each time

679
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,640
you each cycle you're taking pictures to

680
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
make sure everything is the same at that

681
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,278
point we decided these are looking good

682
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,840
they're very consistent we're going to

683
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,519
move it into tissue culture

684
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,119
because to take it off the station we

685
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,639
need disease-free plants I can't collect

686
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,879
stuff from the field and send it out to

687
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,679
Growers or to a nursery and it could

688
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,200
have any kind of pathogen on it so we

689
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,159
move it into tissue culture to clean it

690
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,360
up make sure it doesn't have any viruses

691
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,360
make sure it doesn't have phyo uh

692
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:50,000
verticillium various fungal pathogens

693
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,879
and that takes can take it a few months

694
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,839
but it could take a year or more too

695
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,278
some some varieties don't uh tissue

696
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,278
culture

697
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,798
well so we got plants we have to check

698
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,319
them for virus we have to produce more

699
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,679
plants so we can put them back out in

700
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,519
the field make sure tissue culture

701
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,880
didn't screw it up sometimes you put

702
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,879
things in tissue culture what you get

703
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,440
out of tissue culture doesn't look like

704
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,360
what you put in um and so we have to

705
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,000
make sure that we grow plants make sure

706
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,479
they're true to type make sure they look

707
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,398
like what you expect them to look like

708
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,120
all this takes time and we of course

709
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:25,278
take more pictures we want to make sure

710
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,158
it looks like it's supposed to look like

711
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,119
you have to make sure you have the same

712
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,440
product that you in the end with of what

713
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,599
you started with so we confirmed tress

714
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,399
of type at that stage we're like okay we

715
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,000
got virus fre plants let's send it to

716
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:40,558
the nursery so they can propagate it in

717
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,119
large numbers that way we can get it to

718
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,639
some of the

719
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,519
Growers um so in 2014 we sent out 16,000

720
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,480
plus plants to different 11 Growers

721
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,759
across the state so they could grow it

722
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,480
in a large scale and give me some

723
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,278
feedback on how um how it looks for them

724
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,120
how does it look in a commercial setting

725
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:03,679
up to that point we had 25t plots at the

726
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,599
biggest you know so now they get a th000

727
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,440
plants or 2,000 plants and you can see

728
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,839
it on a eighth of an acre or a quarter

729
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,679
of an acre and actually see it in a

730
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,798
large scale um they evaluated the first

731
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,120
year they evaluate it again the second

732
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,278
year because you want to see most of the

733
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,639
Growers will grow it in a perennial

734
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,798
setting and they want to see it more

735
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,320
than one

736
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,079
year so all this takes 15 years we get

737
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,720
to this point and we finally okay it's

738
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,398
time to release it and

739
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,000
you're here today it's being released

740
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,479
today it's being announced so it is

741
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,759
available to Growers now they won't plan

742
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,038
it until next year but of course we're

743
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,119
taking pictures all along to make sure

744
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:47,038
that it's the same thing question you

745
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,038
send that out to the

746
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,798
yes so what the Growers will pay what

747
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,440
the Growers will do or what the nursery

748
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:58,558
will charge is a propagation fee so that

749
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,640
the cost of propagation is offset um so

750
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,918
it is not the same price that

751
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,159
is uh it's we're not selling the plants

752
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,679
they're offsetting the cost of

753
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:13,919
propagation it's a semantics but um it

754
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,159
is not available to commercial Growers

755
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,399
um in this Kate was only available to

756
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,360
Growers of the New York State Berry

757
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,239
grows Association through a Cooperative

758
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,798
agreement with Cornell University that

759
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,000
we have with the association um so we

760
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:27,720
didn't send it to just any Growers we

761
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,398
sent it to Growers who were part of this

762
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,200
organization ation that we had a

763
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:35,119
contract with um for doing the testing

764
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,240
and so this was this year this is fruit

765
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,278
I got from a commercial grower it looked

766
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,440
great he was happy with it we moved

767
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,000
forward so that it's now going to be

768
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,159
available and they will plant the first

769
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,440
commercial crop this coming spring in

770
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,000
2017 of course we won't see that fruit

771
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,640
until 2018 so again there's time every

772
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,119
time you have to grow the plants so it

773
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,919
can really uh take a long time to get

774
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,079
through it so how do we speed up the

775
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,278
process well protected agriculture is

776
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,678
one of those ways certainly the high and

777
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:09,798
low tunnels speed things up the plants

778
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,360
grow faster you get a better look at the

779
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,038
plants because every year you have a

780
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,240
good year because you can control the

781
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,919
environment much better this year in our

782
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,839
open field the raspberries are very very

783
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,960
short where they're not irrigated they

784
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,119
just didn't grow much because they

785
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,120
didn't get any rain in the tunnels where

786
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,319
it's irrigated and protected the plants

787
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,879
look just like they do every year

788
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,519
they're 8 ft tall and they're covered in

789
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,760
fruit and so we can really get a a

790
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,798
faster look at things and since we can

791
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,038
look at them quickly we can evaluate

792
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,278
them quickly and move things into the

793
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,200
commercial stream much faster because we

794
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,200
can make decisions based on better

795
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,639
information we can make that decision

796
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,159
quickly and get them into tissue culture

797
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,799
quickly and once we have them in tissue

798
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,799
culture there are commercial Labs we

799
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,839
work with who can propagate them and

800
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,599
propagate thousands of plants very

801
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,119
quickly from a few tissue cultures uh

802
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,480
both r raspberry and strawberry work

803
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,158
very well in tissue culture and so

804
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,200
propagation once you have the culture

805
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,320
started goes very rapidly um and in

806
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,000
raspberry it is commonly done in in the

807
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:11,639
commercial nurseries that people will

808
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,038
use tissue culture for

809
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,880
propagation we've what the other thing

810
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,079
we've done is sped up the grower

811
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,120
valuations rather than waiting until

812
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,278
that last stage to get it to Growers

813
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,319
we're really trying to get it to the

814
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,640
Growers much sooner so this year in New

815
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,599
York we sent some 2012 selections to a

816
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,559
couple of growers in really preliminary

817
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,558
trials but to get a commercial uh look

818
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,398
at them much earlier in the process only

819
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,038
four years from when it was selected

820
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,158
versus uh 10 or 12 years after it was

821
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,440
selected some of our commercial Growers

822
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,720
our larger Growers um so we do that with

823
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,320
the New York State Berry growers

824
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,000
association some of our other

825
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:49,558
Cooperators in larger locations larger

826
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,679
industry locations they want they want

827
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,000
new stuff as fast as they can get it so

828
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,759
sometimes one or two years after it's

829
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,278
selected they'll get to take a look at

830
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,919
it because they're really interested in

831
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:00,880
moving very quickly and they have the

832
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,639
infrastructure to give me feedback very

833
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,039
very rapidly and so that's one of the

834
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,798
things we're doing to try and speed

835
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:10,638
things up um long term we'd like to do

836
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:13,398
some marker assisted selection um using

837
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,079
genetics and and DNA technology to speed

838
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:17,518
up the process and make it more

839
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,960
efficient throw out the stuff that isn't

840
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,359
worthy before it ever makes it to the

841
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,600
field um but we're a long ways from that

842
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,638
so one of the things we're doing in the

843
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,398
tunnel is growing things in pots so in

844
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,319
the field when we plant a seed l it

845
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,239
usually has to grow at least 18 months

846
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,918
before we can see fruit the summer types

847
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,079
need to grow for 2 years before we can

848
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,240
see fruit these fall types in a high

849
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,199
tunnel in pots we can plant them in the

850
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,319
greenhouse in March bring them out in

851
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,480
the pots in May into the tunnels and

852
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,480
they're fruiting now so between March

853
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,798
and now we get to see fruit and we can

854
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,200
eliminate a lot of stuff that is

855
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,158
unsuitable now we can't make great

856
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,759
decisions on the stuff that looks best

857
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,799
but we can move it much faster and

858
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:00,720
eliminate a lot of the stuff that we're

859
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,319
not interested in and so this is one of

860
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,159
the things that we're we're starting to

861
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,319
do more of so in a high tunnel like this

862
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,240
it's uh 24 ft wide we can fit about 900

863
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,038
potted plants and so we can go through

864
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,599
900 plants a year in there and those in

865
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:15,919
the field those might be in the field

866
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,158
for three or four years for each cycle

867
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,559
to look at

868
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,720
them so traditional breeding which we

869
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,798
were doing before in the mure genetic

870
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
side of things uh we've done quite a bit

871
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,278
of genetic mapping um we've done some

872
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,440
marker assisted sele ction we've done

873
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,759
some RNA seek work and genome sequencing

874
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,000
to try and increase the level of

875
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,720
information that we have for uh the

876
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,440
genetics of raspberry and for the future

877
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,038
we'd like to to try the you know the

878
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,919
latest thing that everybody wants to try

879
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:45,200
is crisper um but we think there's some

880
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,960
really interesting things that could be

881
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,200
done in Colony propagated crops um with

882
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
this

883
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,880
technology and since raspberry works so

884
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,240
well in tissue culture it's a fairly

885
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,240
natural um thing to try it on on because

886
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
it is usually done in tissue culture so

887
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,880
we've done some genetic mapping in

888
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,319
raspberry primarily for phytop root rot

889
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,799
resistance so phyo is a disease of the

890
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,638
soil of the roots that's in the soil um

891
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,079
it's pretty devastating on raspberries

892
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:14,959
it's very persistent um there is good

893
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,398
resistance but most of the resistance

894
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,200
are in varieties that aren't

895
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,278
particularly useful for the commercial

896
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,600
market so we'd like to do breeding and

897
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,638
you can do

898
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,398
breeding um and you can do field of

899
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:28,079
analysis but if it doesn't rain you

900
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,839
don't get phytop so it's hard to green

901
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,960
stuff in the field for phytops

902
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,839
resistance if you have a dry climate um

903
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,480
or if you have a dry year like we did

904
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,558
this year we had lots of problems on

905
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,480
raspberries this year but phyter was not

906
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,638
one of them because we didn't have a lot

907
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,639
of

908
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,798
infection so how do you look at phyter

909
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,679
then in a in a in a way that is

910
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:51,158
consistent we developed a hydroponic

911
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,559
system so we could actually observe the

912
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,440
roots in the raspberry as the disease is

913
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,759
uh developing so that we could get an

914
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,080
accurate screen of resistance

915
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:04,558
uh and then we develop molecular markers

916
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:07,359
get a genetic map and then look for qtl

917
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:10,279
analysis the quantitative trait so uh

918
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,319
phyo resistance in raspberry is a

919
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,919
multi-e trait a quantitative trait and

920
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,639
you look for qtl's to try to figure out

921
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,598
where in the genome most of the

922
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,240
influence on that trade is coming from

923
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,599
so here's the hydroponic system you can

924
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,838
see when there is no pathogen raspberry

925
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,639
likes it very well it grows very well

926
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,599
the root systems are white and healthy

927
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,159
um but once you introduce the pathogen

928
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,919
very quickly apparent which ones are

929
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,519
susceptible and which ones are resistant

930
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,319
so it gives us an accurate screen to use

931
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,000
for our genetic mapping and we've been

932
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,919
able to use this as you'll see multiple

933
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,679
times in different aspects of this

934
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,000
project so this work was uh was done by

935
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,119
one of my graduate students Jeremy

936
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,679
Patterson uh who now works for Driscoll

937
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,919
strawberry Associates in

938
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,480
California um and so you can see the

939
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,358
genetic map there seven ha haid number

940
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,358
in in raspberry is seven we have seven

941
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:08,039
linkage groups we looked at the um the

942
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,319
disease in different ways we took a

943
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,838
qualitative score just one to five is it

944
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,440
diseased or not diseased and then we

945
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,239
looked at stem lesions so they they

946
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,519
develop stem lesions as the plant is

947
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,519
infected and you can measure how how big

948
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,920
those are um some of the pedals get

949
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,440
lesions so you can do a percentage of

950
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,079
the pedals that get lesions and then you

951
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,039
can take a root score as well since we

952
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,039
could observe the roots directly when

953
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,880
you do a pot study and the roots are

954
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,719
surrounded by soil you get dead or not

955
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,880
dead but it's very hard to tell what's

956
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,719
going on in the roots and so this way we

957
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,400
are able to look at the roots directly

958
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,399
and get a score there and we found that

959
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,160
all four of those traits map to two

960
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,720
regions so it turn tells us that when

961
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,920
we're measuring these things all of them

962
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,879
were a good measure of resistance and

963
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,039
that they were measuring essentially the

964
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,240
same thing that same level of disease

965
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,719
res uh disease development um and then

966
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,879
the perent percentage of the variation

967
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,118
that was explained by the various scores

968
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,640
so some of them quite a bit when you

969
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,599
combine the two locations 50% of the

970
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,440
variation was defined by that score um

971
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:15,440
only 25% with a stem Legion so it wasn't

972
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,440
as um as consistent you'll see 55 and so

973
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,920
on so what but these regions of the

974
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,200
genome very clearly have something to do

975
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,838
with um with resistance the problem is

976
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:28,279
that that it's when you start looking at

977
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,960
the sequence it's a very l large amount

978
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,480
of sequence and so there's quite a few

979
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,280
genes in that region um that you would

980
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,199
have to look at so we published some of

981
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,680
this work in tag some years ago um it

982
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,199
was it was later confirmed by another

983
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,358
group in Scotland that they published a

984
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,759
very similar uh work that uh came up

985
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,559
with the same conclusions which we are

986
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,480
very gratified to see since they are

987
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,318
competitors um we have done some marker

988
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,240
assisted selection with those markers in

989
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:57,880
those regions um we screened

990
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:00,639
varieties we put varieties in there

991
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,960
introduced it and and uh uh looked at

992
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:06,199
both the markers and the resistance

993
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,318
rating from this and it did pretty well

994
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,879
um when we did the mark it was about

995
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,199
76% accurate and what we found is that

996
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,519
when the resistance came from a

997
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,199
different background the markers kind of

998
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,280
broke down so the background the markers

999
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,559
we found followed a resistance from a

1000
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,680
specific source and there are other

1001
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,799
sources in The Germ plasm that are

1002
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,199
probably not in the same area or at

1003
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,760
least have different markers um

1004
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,439
if they are in that

1005
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,720
area when we looked at populations so

1006
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,960
seedling populations was all over the

1007
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,519
place so some of the seedling

1008
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,039
populations that were of the same Source

1009
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:43,159
very very accurate 90% are better but

1010
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,838
some of the populations that came from

1011
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,799
sources of resistance that we didn't

1012
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:51,039
know that were not from the resistant

1013
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,599
laam um some of them were worse than

1014
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,679
flipping a coin so the markers didn't

1015
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,039
always work across the populations and

1016
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,078
that's one of the things we find very

1017
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,000
commonly in Mark assistant selection

1018
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,560
that they're very population specific

1019
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the markers um and so so what do we do

1020
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,519
we want to find better markers that

1021
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,400
would be a good thing we continue to do

1022
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,679
Marker work or we can continue to look

1023
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,639
at other populations or we could try to

1024
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,118
use some other genomic tools um so the

1025
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,719
marker assisted selection work we

1026
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,400
presented some of this work at at

1027
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,919
International conferences and and

1028
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,599
published that there but we wanted to

1029
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,119
look a little deeper into the question

1030
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,599
of what is actually happening why What

1031
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,400
gene are turned on why is resistance

1032
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,318
happening um so we looked at uh we

1033
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,280
wanted to use RNA seek or RNA

1034
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,639
sequencing um we took root tissue from

1035
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,599
laam which is a resistant variety and

1036
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,719
Titan which is susceptible variety um

1037
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,280
and we did it pre and post disease so we

1038
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,358
wanted to look at what genes were turned

1039
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
on before it had any disease and then

1040
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,519
what happened when you introduced the

1041
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:59,119
disease um into the plant if you're not

1042
00:38:54,519 --> 00:39:01,000
not um familiar with RNA seek RNA seek

1043
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,358
is a way to capture the RNA at a

1044
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,719
specific time point so it isn't really

1045
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,838
you're not following it at over time but

1046
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,199
you grab the RNA from a tissue and

1047
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,639
isolate it and that tells you what's

1048
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,639
going on at that moment and then in this

1049
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,000
case we grabbed it at another moment as

1050
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,799
well and compared the two moments so you

1051
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,760
break them up into small pieces because

1052
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,880
at the time the technology was we were

1053
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,640
at 86 base pairs or nucleotides with

1054
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,920
what could be sequenced using alumina

1055
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:31,118
turn it into DNA sequence it and then

1056
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,280
you have millions of little fragments

1057
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,800
and they have to be all pieced together

1058
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,200
there's quite a few computer programs

1059
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,400
that they do this with um it helps if

1060
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,279
you have a genome a reference genome

1061
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,680
that's already there because you can

1062
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,960
reference those sequences straight to

1063
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:47,239
the genome but if you don't you can put

1064
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,880
it together just like a jigaw puzzle

1065
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,598
where you don't have the picture and

1066
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,200
you're just trying to piece it together

1067
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,400
bit by bit and of course it's done with

1068
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,559
computers to look at every possible

1069
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,079
combination to see what lines up um you

1070
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:01,440
get more accurate when you have a genome

1071
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,240
but sometimes you don't have that

1072
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,480
especially with crops like raspberry

1073
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:08,919
where there is no genome published it's

1074
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,599
not a widely studied genome um or plant

1075
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,400
so there really isn't quite the

1076
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,000
resources you would have for arabidopsis

1077
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,800
or rice or corn or one of the more

1078
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,480
studied crops we actually did both with

1079
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,519
that but so again we took the hydroponic

1080
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,838
system we collected RNA from The Roots

1081
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,880
which is very difficult to do when

1082
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,759
they're in a pot covered with soil so

1083
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,318
this hyro honic system came back into it

1084
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,440
so we could collect fresh root tissue

1085
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:34,759
and then diseased root tissue so you

1086
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,639
could see the difference between the

1087
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,240
susceptible ones and the resistant ones

1088
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,559
in the at the RNA level at the gene

1089
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,000
expression

1090
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:45,719
level so we we uh reported on this at

1091
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,719
pag and a few other uh and the rubis riy

1092
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:51,919
Symposium so what did we do we had about

1093
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,719
71 million reads of 86 nucleotides which

1094
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,720
is fairly typical kind of number overall

1095
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,480
once we looked at all the we we

1096
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:01,759
identified approximately 177,000 genes

1097
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,318
that were expressed in these tissues of

1098
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,240
course all kinds of genes are expressed

1099
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:10,400
they may or may not be related to

1100
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,479
resistance um we we chook between the

1101
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,800
two groups between Titan and laam and

1102
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,199
there was a lot of overlap about 13,000

1103
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,720
genes um and then we did an

1104
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:22,919
alignment both uh to a diploid sorry

1105
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,039
diploid

1106
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,720
strawberry which was pretty much the

1107
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,318
closest genome that we had as a

1108
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,239
reference gen know and then we did

1109
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,639
denovo as well just the one without a

1110
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,759
picture when you just try and piece it

1111
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,480
together based on the sequence you have

1112
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,920
um this work was done by another

1113
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,519
graduate student Jud Ward also works for

1114
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,400
Driscoll strawberry associate he is

1115
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,800
their ahead of their genome department

1116
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,480
now um and then we did a differential

1117
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,400
expression uh uh analysis look at the

1118
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,960
genes between the two groups to see what

1119
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
was

1120
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,318
different this was that uh the assembly

1121
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,439
was done

1122
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,960
um how to do it in non model plants we

1123
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,720
published that in the in the Journal of

1124
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,838
botney um has been very well received

1125
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,799
because there's a lot of crops that

1126
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,119
people have very little genome data to

1127
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,079
work with they don't have a reference

1128
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,119
genome when it's like well how do we how

1129
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,280
do we deal with this all this RNA seek

1130
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,880
data um and so we put that out um so

1131
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,160
what did we find we pretty much in both

1132
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,000
of them you infect them with r with phyo

1133
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,759
and all their defense genes turn on

1134
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,679
everything they have um goes nuts but

1135
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,880
there's some differential expressions

1136
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,480
um so some of these things were turned

1137
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,318
on um I won't get into this the details

1138
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,838
of which what the genes are but these

1139
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:42,279
are have to do with inting the pathogen

1140
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:46,039
and turning on the defense mechanisms

1141
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,440
um we saw differential Expressions so in

1142
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,558
Titan they weren't turned on as much

1143
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,119
they're susceptible one as they were in

1144
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,800
in

1145
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,119
laam so upregulation of very key

1146
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,800
defensive genes uh the pr genes are

1147
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,358
pathogenesis related

1148
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,920
um these are genes that are often turned

1149
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,400
on and expressed when a plant is trying

1150
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,159
to fight off a pathogen of some sort and

1151
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,200
there's a bunch of these genes um we

1152
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:14,598
found uh 18 different ones that were uh

1153
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,838
expressed in lean 10 of them were

1154
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,559
upregulated in laam where only 10 were

1155
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,519
upregulated in Titan and three of them

1156
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,760
were actually down regulated in Titan

1157
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,400
very different expression pattern of

1158
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,200
these defense responsive genes uh

1159
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,880
between the two types between the resist

1160
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,799
istant and the susceptible but of course

1161
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,838
we still the these are large numbers of

1162
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,039
genes that we're looking at um we did a

1163
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,558
blast search of the of the data just

1164
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:40,838
using the terms uh salicylic acid

1165
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,760
jasmonic acid systemic acquired

1166
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,159
resistance defense def uh disease these

1167
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,079
are all terms that are used to describe

1168
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,679
genes and so when we did that we 99

1169
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,920
different uh things came up 99's a lot

1170
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,759
of things to choose from um this is the

1171
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,960
kind of stuff you get from blast

1172
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,359
so we could tell though these were genes

1173
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,318
that were actually differentially

1174
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:06,440
expressed in the resistant type so in

1175
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,880
leam so in the control versus the

1176
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,119
treatment you can see the number goes up

1177
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,920
because it's expressed more great more

1178
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,519
highly in uh in the resistant or when

1179
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,400
the pathogen is actually present and you

1180
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:22,719
see here then these are just the Search

1181
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,358
terms that you use and and what pops up

1182
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,399
from the blast searches and this table

1183
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,719
went on for page after page after page

1184
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,119
because of all the information so you

1185
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,118
have to sort through all this figure out

1186
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,599
what you what you what you're working

1187
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,559
with so where do you go with this I mean

1188
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,880
99's better than

1189
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:44,480
177,000 but we still can't actually do

1190
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,318
uh uh you know candidate Gene work on 99

1191
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,199
different genes it's just not possible

1192
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,239
with the the with the funding I have and

1193
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:53,358
the technology that we have now it would

1194
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,959
take a long time and a big team to do it

1195
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,039
um so some of the things you can rule

1196
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,119
out fairly quickly they're very specific

1197
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,838
responses versus very broad responses so

1198
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,358
some of them are about you know

1199
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:05,119
producing ligant in the in the cells and

1200
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,719
that may not have any direct response

1201
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:12,200
but is a kind of a side response to this

1202
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:13,558
so we can we can start to to um to rule

1203
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:16,000
some of that stuff out and then we want

1204
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,920
to align it to the G The genome to the

1205
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,199
qtls that we have so that we can start

1206
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,599
looking just in the region where the

1207
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,879
qtls are rather than looking through all

1208
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,720
the genome and focus on those first the

1209
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,440
genes that might be um might be present

1210
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,239
in those regions and that's at the stage

1211
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,599
where we're at now analyzing The genome

1212
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:37,318
data that we have with the RNA seek data

1213
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,680
to try and narrow down our choices um

1214
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,639
and then once we start figuring out what

1215
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,598
might be there that's where the crisper

1216
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:45,960
would come in now crisper is something

1217
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,119
though that right now not a lot of

1218
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,480
people don't have a lot of experience

1219
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,200
with myself included um but we think

1220
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,719
there's some Targets in raspberry that

1221
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,598
we can use to learn how to use a

1222
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:58,358
technique and make it possible useful in

1223
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,640
the future if you're not familiar with

1224
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:03,759
crisper it's a bacterial system that

1225
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,960
they theorize is used uhu in protecting

1226
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,240
the bacteria from viral infection

1227
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,559
primarily um if you wondering what the

1228
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,399
the acronym stands for they're clustered

1229
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,800
regularly interpace short palindromic

1230
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,079
repeats that's crisper tells you a lot

1231
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,240
doesn't it um they are specific DNA

1232
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,760
sequences in the bacterial genome that

1233
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:25,959
the bacteria can use to Target um

1234
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,440
alongside this crisper Associated

1235
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,440
protein 9

1236
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,920
it forms a

1237
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,480
complex and it can find the foreign DNA

1238
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,159
in its own genome and systematically or

1239
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,400
U very specifically cut it out and get

1240
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,199
rid of the pathogenic DN uh DNA that's

1241
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,720
what we feel that's what scientists

1242
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,598
think that the actual system does in in

1243
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,000
in

1244
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:51,640
nature uh what they've done is is

1245
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,960
harmonis this to take this section here

1246
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,558
which is that targeted DNA and put in

1247
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,960
one that you you want to change yourself

1248
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:04,559
so make a make this DNA molecule

1249
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,440
yourself so that you can Target a very

1250
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,760
specific DNA sequence that you want to

1251
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,000
change now to do that though you have to

1252
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,119
know the very specific DNA sequence that

1253
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,358
you want to change and it's a very small

1254
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,880
piece of DNA that you want to change so

1255
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:21,279
it's really very challenging to get to

1256
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,800
that point but my new student archa is

1257
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,920
working on this project we're going to

1258
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,079
do some of this work with uh thornless

1259
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,599
because we think a simple trait that we

1260
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,480
can very easily visually um work with

1261
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,000
and and classify is what we're going to

1262
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,400
work on so we have a population that's

1263
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,480
uh that's segregating we'll do some

1264
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,599
sequencing to try and find the gene for

1265
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,599
thornless um and then try to use crisper

1266
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,079
to work on the thornless gene because we

1267
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,400
can do this in tissue culture we can

1268
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,640
very rapidly uh phenotype them as the

1269
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,079
process goes

1270
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,679
forward I think we at the end of this uh

1271
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,640
in the end then we want to transfer that

1272
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,558
to to phyo work as we narrow down the

1273
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,400
different genes that could possibly be

1274
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:09,040
interested uh in phyo their

1275
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,318
resistance with that you I mentioned my

1276
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,679
couple of my former students both

1277
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,239
working for driscolls um Bill Boone was

1278
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,799
a technician in my program for many

1279
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,199
years and uh Colin is my current

1280
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,400
technician without him I don't have a

1281
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,759
chance to get a whole lot done um and of

1282
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,480
course archina will be working with me

1283
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,200
for the next several years on this

1284
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,199
crisper project we're very excited to

1285
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:30,799
see where that go

1286
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,799
go so in a nutshell there's the berry

1287
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,079
breeding at Cornell and if there are any

1288
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,839
questions I will be around for a few

1289
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,920
minutes Oran a question about it me not

1290
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,639
mentioning organic organic is very

1291
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,039
challenging thing for berries because

1292
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,358
they're very very perishable they have a

1293
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,279
lot of things that like to uh eat them

1294
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,318
besides humans um the orc is even more

1295
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,839
difficult because of all the rain so

1296
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,480
without the use of fungicides it's very

1297
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,440
challenging to get

1298
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,358
uh organic this new pest called spotted

1299
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,400
PL gropo which is a little fruit fly is

1300
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:05,960
causing even more trouble with it most

1301
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,599
organic production right now is grown in

1302
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,280
dry climate locations um and they are

1303
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,960
using Organic pesticides to try to

1304
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,440
control that fly but that is that's the

1305
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,318
only approach we have right now um

1306
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,639
nutrition is very difficult as well in

1307
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:22,719
these tunnel systems with Organic

1308
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:24,318
fertilizers because they don't work well

1309
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,239
in the fertigation

1310
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,318
systems um so we don't do a lot of uh

1311
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,439
organic raspberry or strawberry

1312
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:35,558
production in New York um just because

1313
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,559
of the challenges of the

1314
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,440
environment question I'm just curious if

1315
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,720
you looked at the nutritional profiles

1316
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,720
or any phytochemical profiles of the

1317
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:45,759
different raspberry colors the question

1318
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:49,598
was about looking at phytochemical and

1319
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,119
nutritional um uh differences amongst

1320
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,519
the varieties we had gotten a fair bit

1321
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,039
of work in that area uh both here and

1322
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,440
then in collaboration with uh North

1323
00:49:55,039 --> 00:50:01,480
Carolina State they have a that does a

1324
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,200
lot of that work we find wide ranges of

1325
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,079
certainly Advan content finic content

1326
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:09,558
amongst the Beres they're all very high

1327
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:11,318
though um even the yellow ones are very

1328
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,920
high in phenolic compounds even though

1329
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:18,000
they have no pigment um they're high in

1330
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,159
vitamin A folic acid vitamin C host of

1331
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,880
things in general berries are good for

1332
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:26,719
you you want people to eat more of them

1333
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,000
not necessarily specific ones so um but

1334
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,879
there's a lot of published work on the

1335
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,880
differences amongst the

1336
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,838
varieties any questions in Geneva I kept

1337
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,838
you there long

1338
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:48,119
enough importantly Bruce here um how in

1339
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,318
in your RNA SE work how did you choose a

1340
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:54,200
Time point to analyze and

1341
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:57,639
um a Time point that is a Time point

1342
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:59,919
after inoculation to collect your

1343
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,960
and um would there be any better plant

1344
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:07,920
material if you were to do this

1345
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,480
again so um in our studies I think you

1346
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,079
all heard the question in our studies

1347
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,559
before in doing the uh analysis of

1348
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,920
inheritance we able to observe the root

1349
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:22,119
systems as the pathogen was introduced

1350
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:24,079
and the disease um progressed and so we

1351
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,079
use our experience from that to choose a

1352
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,240
Time Point well obviously we did zero

1353
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:34,920
time point before the pathogen and then

1354
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:38,558
um we actually took uh samples at at 2

1355
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:42,680
days 6 days and 30 days and those were

1356
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,440
very distinct time points um in the

1357
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,318
inheritance study at two days there was

1358
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,798
no symptoms yet but there was infection

1359
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,199
and so we could measure that there was

1360
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:52,358
infection in the plant at 6 days you

1361
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:55,558
start seeing

1362
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:57,759
symptoms and at 30 days you start seeing

1363
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,839
grow back of the roots that are in the

1364
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,359
resistant

1365
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,960
plants so we didn't have that last time

1366
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,880
point with the susceptible ones CU they

1367
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,039
were all dead um but we were able to

1368
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,160
then choose those points so that we

1369
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:12,400
could see the progression of the disease

1370
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,519
not only in the plant but in the

1371
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,838
expression as far as a better

1372
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:21,719
tissue it seems that for phyo that the

1373
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,719
resistance is in the root system is

1374
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:26,759
expressed in the root system so I think

1375
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,039
that's the best tissue that to use

1376
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,960
although it is somewhat challenging to

1377
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,679
use actually I'm asking about the

1378
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,039
varieties that you would use would you

1379
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:40,480
use the same uh varieties um are these

1380
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:43,159
varieties related to each other or are

1381
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,440
there any others that you would consider

1382
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,759
using at this point we want to stay with

1383
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,480
the varieties that we've been using

1384
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,480
because we have so much historical data

1385
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,318
on those varieties um certainly there

1386
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,240
are other sources of resistance that we

1387
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:57,599
would like to look at in the future um

1388
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,279
but

1389
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,119
can only do so much because we know

1390
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,000
there are sources that are not related

1391
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,680
to this this source that we're using um

1392
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,559
but at this point we don't have plans to

1393
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:15,759
use other other genotypes so our time is

1394
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,760
up I want to thank Professor Weber for

1395
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,719
fascinating this has been a production

1396
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,720
of Cornell University on the web at

1397
