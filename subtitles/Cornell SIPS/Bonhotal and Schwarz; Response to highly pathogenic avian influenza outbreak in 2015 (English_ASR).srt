1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,099
we work a lot with mortality we work a

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,219
lot with composting with organic matter

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,339
at the waste management institute and in

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:23,270
this last year how many people knew that

7
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:26,809
we had an avian influenza outbreak in

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,850
the United States so quite a few people

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,829
if you listening to NPR they did have it

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,649
on NPR they had it on some other places

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:39,858
it was in some publications but it

12
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:42,739
wasn't out there that that vastly 50

13
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:45,109
million birds were affected west of the

14
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:46,549
Mississippi so we didn't get it in the

15
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,588
East at all so we didn't have to deal

16
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,358
with it in the East but we were

17
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:55,189
commissioned to deal with it in the West

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,260
so or from west of the Mississippi so we

19
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,178
did lose 50 million birds or 50 million

20
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,768
birds had to be either killed or they

21
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:05,390
died of the disease they don't die of

22
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:07,250
the disease right away some when we came

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,290
on to cite would be dead but there would

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,328
be some half dead and there'd be some

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:16,780
alive and their be you know all

26
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:16,779
different ones so it was interesting

27
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:29,180
what we ready we work with we've for the

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:32,750
last twelve 12 13 14 years we've been

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,899
working with avis so animal Plant Health

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,950
Inspection Service and we work with them

31
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:42,409
in Washington DC so we're working with

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,240
them and we work with them on mortality

33
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,270
issues because when we have a disease

34
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,489
outbreak we need to be dealing with that

35
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:52,459
disease and we're going to have a lot of

36
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:54,048
carcasses to get rid of we don't have a

37
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:56,658
lot of options to get rid of these

38
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,450
carcasses so they often times lay around

39
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:04,640
and when there's a disease outbreak they

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:07,060
can't lay around so this year last year

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,280
was the first time push came to shove

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,189
actually it was to your January last

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,669
year push came to shove and they said we

44
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:18,800
need to get these birds dealt with and

45
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,969
we need to get them into we need to

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,990
compost them

47
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:25,789
a lot of the poultry farms felt that

48
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,950
they were going to be able to just land

49
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:31,729
fill them and the landfills would take

50
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:35,389
them or they be able to bury them and in

51
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:37,369
most cases that was not the case some

52
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:39,919
things did go to landfill and we'll talk

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,490
about those but for the most part the

54
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,319
land pills don't want because people the

55
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,360
people that work in the landfills may

56
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,789
there's fear that they may be exposed to

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,000
the diseases it's not a disease that has

58
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:55,400
jumped to humans at this point but it's

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,300
still disease that's airborne and and

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,099
can move around and fear is there so the

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,689
landfills won't take them in there all

62
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,909
private landfill so they don't and they

63
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,959
don't have to take them nobody can say

64
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:11,840
you have to take them so they're there

65
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:16,629
one very very large farm with millions

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:22,370
of birds I think it was a genio farm

67
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:27,859
right the jennie-o farm in Iowa which

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,599
was a center fresh not her do but one of

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:34,100
the big ones that we'd recognize the

70
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,819
name they just got those big mogul the

71
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,229
foldable dumpsters that they say just

72
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,849
put all your stuff in and we'll take it

73
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,530
away you know so they got those and

74
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:47,049
thought that they were going to get rid

75
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:51,349
of them that way and weren't able to so

76
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:53,390
we come on to the farms I got a call I

77
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,689
was the first one out in the United

78
00:03:53,389 --> 00:04:00,259
States so I got a call from a fish on a

79
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:02,209
saturday night saying can you go to

80
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:03,319
California and I happen to be in utah

81
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,659
writing Mary and I were writing

82
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:13,759
curriculum in Utah and I said well I

83
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:17,449
guess so so the next week I went out to

84
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:21,858
food in modesto went into California and

85
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:24,349
and met with the first farm so I talked

86
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,990
to the farms quite a bit before I went

87
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,760
in because you have farm managers and

88
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,660
you have farm owners and the farm owners

89
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,279
are very

90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,660
they are the ones that are financing

91
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,759
these things so they don't know very

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,340
much about what's going on but they want

93
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:42,560
to have control so we went out we

94
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:44,659
provided them with educational materials

95
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,399
beforehand so that they had an idea of

96
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,460
what we were going to do and one of the

97
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,859
things that we need for these to compost

98
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,810
is carbon we have to have carbon on the

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,870
farms we can't just pile up birds and

100
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,730
expect them to degrade and in this

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,920
situation we really needed to sanitize

102
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,379
and that's what we're there to do not to

103
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,800
make compost we're there to sanitize and

104
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:08,240
kill the virus in the birds so we

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,550
provided them with information so that

106
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,860
they knew what was going on we tried to

107
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,150
get carbon to the sites before we got

108
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,460
there because all we're doing we're not

109
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,319
actually yes we were physically moving

110
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,689
birds and things like that but but we're

111
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,659
not there to were there to direct

112
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,219
operations to let them know how to do it

113
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:30,590
and then to make sure that it's working

114
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,170
properly once they do that speaking with

115
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:35,209
a the managers they've had a huge loss

116
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,100
you know if you can imagine losing

117
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:42,349
millions of birds on one farm they're

118
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,470
affected mentally emotionally we have to

119
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,210
think about that as well and so that was

120
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,730
one thing that we had to go on the farm

121
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:53,239
and say okay we understand where you are

122
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,430
we understand that it's really important

123
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:02,689
to you and we need to deal with this

124
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:05,918
whole situation before we could go in we

125
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:10,069
needed to have full PPE so there are

126
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:13,609
disconnects on who wears what actually

127
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,079
so this is what I was wearing you know

128
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,230
this is the type of stuff that I was

129
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,509
wearing I had full PPE I had you know I

130
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,189
didn't have glasses at first but I had

131
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,539
everything else breathing apparatus all

132
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:31,370
that kind of stuff the farm this is the

133
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,780
farmer up here had a medical gown on so

134
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,090
that's what the health department

135
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,369
provided them with so they said can we

136
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:39,379
get some PPE some protection for

137
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,079
ourselves and that's what they ended up

138
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,719
with so there's a real difference there

139
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,848
this is provided by a fith when we get

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,919
there it's you know we're getting

141
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,959
dressed and taping everything doing all

142
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,579
that kind of stuff and farm themselves

143
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,310
the farmers themselves don't how to

144
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,438
access to that until they get there so

145
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,839
the Health Department kind of gave them

146
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:04,159
a raw deal in this case this is actually

147
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:07,250
was in South Dakota and I'm going to

148
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:09,589
turn it over to Mary stand here so I can

149
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,139
pick up well I think you can pick me up

150
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:15,918
without first standing right here okay

151
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:18,228
cool so she was talking about the

152
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,799
importance of assessment and knowing

153
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:25,968
what you're walking into and when i got

154
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,460
to wisconsin in april of 2015 this is

155
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:30,110
what I walked into not at all what I was

156
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:34,609
expecting I had received some

157
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:38,300
information from a fost about the size

158
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,069
of the houses and how many birds and I'm

159
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,288
thinking my stuff we've been doing a lot

160
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,908
we've done a lot of birds before you

161
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:46,068
know I know how to compost and I'm

162
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:48,019
thinking okay no big deal we'll take the

163
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,639
litter you know will spread it out on

164
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,370
the ground will throw the birds on top

165
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,060
with carbon ion and we're all good yeah

166
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,670
not at all so so we get there and this

167
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,990
is

168
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:05,280
this is on a farm that has a it's called

169
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:09,269
cage-free layers okay there are 3

170
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,009
humvees alleyways in each House okay

171
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:16,560
their page free because they're free to

172
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:20,189
fly around all right this thing is 370

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,060
feet long these are the ways are three

174
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:27,569
feet wide okay there's only a door here

175
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,259
one door one door one door and in front

176
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,200
there's a small like 6 x 10 space that

177
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:38,220
you could maybe weíll something in okay

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,810
I'm thinking myself who on earth are we

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,080
kidding all these dead birds out of

180
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,569
there now this guy's got five houses

181
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,650
okay with three of these in each of

182
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,129
those houses all our 370 feet long with

183
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,079
one door in this particular house this

184
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,720
is the first house there was forty four

185
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,800
thousand birds they were all dead when I

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,590
got there ok I got there on a monday for

187
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:11,099
the ones up on top no he's actually that

188
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:13,050
one's still dead okay I got the round of

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,360
Monday's I think they had died on

190
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:22,709
Thursday okay now and this is from the

191
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,500
disease okay now luckily they kept it

192
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,850
cool in there so they weren't totally

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,620
liquefying I mean they were they were

194
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,529
starting to liquefy but they didn't

195
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,570
smell terrible they were still there was

196
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,629
still some some stuff there okay it

197
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,879
wasn't just just a liquid matte the

198
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,809
savvy barn the second house had about

199
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:46,259
80% bed 28,000 purse the other three

200
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,879
houses that had about I don't know 35

201
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,269
thousand each

202
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:54,149
there might have been ten percent debt

203
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:56,069
so it hadn't spread okay it probably

204
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:59,100
wasn't going to because we're talking

205
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,780
for days in between so probably wasn't

206
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,960
going to spread any further so now we

207
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:06,209
gotta kill those other three houses look

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,950
we gotta kill for twenty percent and

209
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:13,710
in-house to that haven't been that what

210
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,560
didn't die of the disease and on top of

211
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:19,830
it you can't foam in here but you get

212
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,299
birds flying up here okay and if you

213
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,280
follow me I'll show you some bow me

214
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,959
later if you go home you're only get in

215
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,669
here unless you can fill that whole

216
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,009
house up and then you're in real trouble

217
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:31,979
because everything's soaking wet you

218
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:35,159
ruined your equipment and your birds are

219
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,470
just you know bonus or something right

220
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,069
there but with chicken that's how it

221
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,450
happens yeah this is my hair okay and

222
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,570
was my first time dealing with an

223
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,210
emergency situation luckily I had the

224
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,980
people that I got in contact with as

225
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,840
soon as I got there were well prepared

226
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,659
you know they said texted me that gave

227
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,660
me a person who knew her crap knew her

228
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:00,179
chickens do something she was very smart

229
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:01,980
and you know we got all the PPE and

230
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,939
everything like that so everything was

231
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:09,990
good this is the proud of that that far

232
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,840
this is all of the equipment okay so you

233
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,789
know we're trying to figure out how to

234
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,170
get the birds out we're trying to figure

235
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:17,879
out where we're going to compost because

236
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,219
we can't compose you in the barn cuz

237
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,088
there's no space for it okay they're

238
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,860
talking about sending the workers down

239
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:30,379
like they would collect eggs in their

240
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,949
dust mask not even a might even try

241
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:37,550
decorator in their dust mask and walking

242
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:39,649
down through the 370 feet you know to

243
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:42,169
pull that chickens it can have to push a

244
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,659
cart clear away pull them back out you

245
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,669
know and I might know who that is

246
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:48,679
definitely not having any back wahap

247
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:53,120
hazard that's just not happening we'll

248
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:55,878
figure something else out so this is

249
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,610
your lips what we figured out okay this

250
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,899
is an exercise I should tell you that i

251
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,360
was there from a Monday through a Friday

252
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:08,360
okay we still had not started composting

253
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,620
at that point we did build a test i'll

254
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,470
which i'll show you so that i could

255
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,480
teach them how to compost but now we're

256
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,028
talking those birds have been dead a

257
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,438
week the other birds still haven't been

258
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:24,470
held the ones that are dying our

259
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:26,208
liquefying are getting bad but so as

260
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,339
they're waiting this is what end and I

261
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:32,619
apologize for the ferry's sideways but

262
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:35,620
it was taken bad boys on an iphone so oh

263
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,620
ok

264
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:45,389
just cook there we go so this was that

265
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:48,778
manure belt and they push the birds down

266
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:56,609
onto the felt and they came down into

267
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:58,859
the manure system and then came out here

268
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:03,480
because they had a manure system that

269
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:05,879
went from each bar to to the compost

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,129
this is a compost bar and a cup where he

271
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,918
was composting manure and that's where

272
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:14,609
we ended up building our first few pubs

273
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:19,188
okay so using ingenuity and whatever

274
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:23,569
they had on hand until they did finally

275
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:26,428
contract with a company to come in and

276
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:30,058
suck the dead birds out with a big

277
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:32,480
vacuum okay to get the Deford but then

278
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:35,219
they had more trouble with D populations

279
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,100
and they ended up having to suck out

280
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:42,569
portions at a time and then use a

281
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:45,298
garbage can co2 killer which I was not

282
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:47,149
part of did not see I'm glad I didn't

283
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:50,480
I've heard it with the fiasco

284
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:54,860
that's you know you make do with what

285
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,310
you have so they should probably have

286
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:03,919
had the other one first because this is

287
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:06,169
a layer when we have post birds smaller

288
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,529
especially Birds we can't do it the way

289
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:12,289
genes going to show you with the turkeys

290
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:15,110
we need to have a bed of carbon okay and

291
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:17,899
then you put the dead birds layer the

292
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,129
dead birds and their manure on top of it

293
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:25,669
and then cover with more carbon and then

294
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:28,460
we filled in layers and we have back

295
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,819
there some factions yep claim to

296
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:38,480
actually see the process this was the

297
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:40,520
first windrow that eventually anyway

298
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,990
right here on this little corner you can

299
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,460
see something that's raised up that was

300
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,070
the test window which is in the next

301
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,290
slide the Becky and I built before I

302
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,590
left to show her how to do it and then

303
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:54,990
they continue down with the base

304
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,930
ended up with three inside but there

305
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,240
were so many birds that ended up with

306
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:03,539
maybe 12 more outside and we had to get

307
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,389
they had to get permission from the

308
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:09,240
department of natural resources as to

309
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,189
where they could put those piles so that

310
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,039
took some time you know a lot of

311
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,530
rigmarole if you have the map to see

312
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,099
where there might be hydrologically

313
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:22,259
sensitive soil or whatever so that you

314
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,960
could get approval to put these windows

315
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,299
outside there was a lot of stuff that we

316
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:35,759
had to go through and in addition this

317
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:40,379
farm had 200,000 dozen eggs that also

318
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:43,980
needed to be taken care of they were all

319
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:47,639
in cold storage eggs as you all know our

320
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:51,450
round and they roll right so if we try

321
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:55,289
to put all those eggs each you these

322
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,720
compost piles hole they would roll out

323
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,339
plus you're cold and we're deming

324
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,750
they're cold you don't want to put a

325
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,399
whole bunch of cold stuff which team

326
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,539
will talk about later too in your

327
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,819
compost process we're trying to create

328
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:08,909
heat because he is what kills the virus

329
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,640
so and the other problem with him was

330
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:13,559
they were getting flats that hold two

331
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,689
and a half dozen some of them were

332
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,599
cardboard which is fine we could come

333
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,300
somewhat more plastic so to compost

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
those eggs which a lot of farms did end

335
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:27,879
up composting their eggs we chose not to

336
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,990
we were able to take all of those eggs

337
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,990
you know on a pork on pork put them into

338
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,350
a big truck deliver them to the landfill

339
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,610
okay that was a lot easier but you do if

340
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,700
we were going to compost him we would

341
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:46,120
have had to show them all out of their

342
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,550
containers break them somehow and then

343
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,409
add them to the windrow as we were

344
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,719
building so that was just not something

345
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:56,230
that was going to happen we did add beef

346
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,840
they had just got me new feed for the

347
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,210
birds just before this hit and of course

348
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,970
very little of it was eaten because the

349
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:08,789
urge we're dying so we have to empty out

350
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:11,740
their all their feet drop 50 silos and

351
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,389
put that into the pile and you have to

352
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,609
remember that all of the things that

353
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,810
could possibly be contaminated when you

354
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:24,789
take care of these so this is the

355
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:28,328
teaching pile okay and this shows two

356
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:29,889
separate layers of it what we did

357
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:33,399
because I really wanted them to do this

358
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,100
right was we built a two-foot base which

359
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,740
is

360
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:38,538
what we recommend what whoopsie wmi

361
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,359
recommends some people would use less

362
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:44,240
but I know my two feet is probably

363
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,788
different than your two feet so what we

364
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,929
did was we build the two-foot base and

365
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:55,579
then we put sticks in to leave two foot

366
00:17:49,929 --> 00:18:00,350
clearance all around and make them put

367
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:03,980
the birds in that clearance and then we

368
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:05,480
move the sticks up and made the sticks

369
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,089
were like to beat and you made them feel

370
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,710
that well they were said that was then

371
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,839
you have a one-foot layer between we

372
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,850
made them filled up with the carbon to

373
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,189
one foot I don't know if they did that

374
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,599
too while all of the compost piles but I

375
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,450
wanted to make sure that at least the

376
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,019
the teaching pile was done properly so

377
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,880
that they would get adequate

378
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,168
temperatures and get adequate

379
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,120
microbiological my clothes would do

380
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,390
there there were now these birds

381
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,739
remember these birds were but we go well

382
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,230
that couldn't we go about five dates

383
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,548
dead six days dead when we built this

384
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:43,099
pile okay and within three days so they

385
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:45,079
were cold you know they weren't hot

386
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:48,240
anymore within three days we had

387
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:51,638
temperatures of 130 because

388
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,349
okay and and that had a lot to do with

389
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:59,528
the amount of basement clearance in the

390
00:18:53,349 --> 00:19:01,119
addition of the carbon and I think well

391
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:05,109
these are some of her outdoor wind grows

392
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:10,569
to these others these years okay my lad

393
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:11,949
jingo so all in all we really wanted to

394
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:14,048
make sure that we were composting

395
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,360
indoors as much as possible that is the

396
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:18,940
rule always compost indoors we don't

397
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,118
want to liberate the virus the virus can

398
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,639
be spread on the air that bio eros eros

399
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:26,769
Eliza's and leaves the house so it goes

400
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:28,898
out through fans fans are always on in

401
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:31,269
those houses and it's hot enough that

402
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:34,599
they can't allow us to work in there

403
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,009
without the fans on so it depending on

404
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,678
the time of year but but at this time

405
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:41,278
and this was April it still was too hot

406
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:46,778
they really needed to have the fans on

407
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:49,569
there's there's another I won't go into

408
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:51,579
that right now so these are out just

409
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:53,558
outdoor windows this is how they some of

410
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:56,470
them like with Mary situation where they

411
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,720
might not have had enough outdoor indoor

412
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,579
space to do the composting we've got to

413
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,649
move them out and we want to move these

414
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:04,769
birds and the eggs and the feed and all

415
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:07,839
that kind of stuff as little as possible

416
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:10,359
and I say this is actually not part of

417
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,740
our jobs so Mary and I didn't do this as

418
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,109
our jobs because we don't have funding

419
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,490
to do this right now so if we had

420
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:17,498
funding that would have allowed us to

421
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,749
respond to an emergency like this we

422
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,819
could have we were we were brought in by

423
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:30,879
atheists directly so we were a facin

424
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:32,980
ployees for the time period yeah so so

425
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:35,408
carbon sources are tremendously

426
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,450
important we have to make sure that they

427
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,220
bring carbon sources on it and right now

428
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,879
we're writing all of the stuff that

429
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,730
needed to be written in we have a very

430
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:48,939
large network of people from California

431
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,128
to to Virginia and there are a lot of

432
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,350
them are at land-grant universities and

433
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:55,750
we all sort of work on this together and

434
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:59,138
have meetings every couple years to talk

435
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:01,169
about mortality it's a fun time had by

436
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,168
all

437
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,710
anyway shavings we can use shavings and

438
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,720
they're often times on farms and they

439
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,610
used as bedding or ready for the for the

440
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,500
animals but they don't give you the

441
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,659
porosity that you really want you really

442
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,029
want chunky your material underneath the

443
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,130
chunkier the better because you need the

444
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:23,259
air to go to be pulled under the pile

445
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,010
from the bottom and it and the heat

446
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:28,990
pulls up through too many effect but we

447
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,579
really white like chunky your material

448
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,160
but we've got to work with what's on

449
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:34,449
hand and as you can see here this was

450
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,460
South Dakota there's nothing out there

451
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,990
there were no trees out there there was

452
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,929
you know that was just really hard to

453
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,460
find any carbon however so they had the

454
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,679
shaving so they had some shavings they

455
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,620
throw it in this gray stuff up here is

456
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:51,130
sunflower holes so the sunflower holes

457
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:53,019
actually held their strength and we had

458
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,059
good porosity around those so we could

459
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,799
use those as the base and the air would

460
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:58,899
be able to be pulled in from the bottom

461
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,639
of the pile so that we'd have fresh air

462
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,280
going through those piles the piles are

463
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,580
none of these piles are turned in the

464
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,379
beginning they're all static piles so we

465
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,519
want them to work by themselves we don't

466
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,110
want them and if we build them right

467
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,429
they will there's really no problem

468
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:17,349
we've been doing it for a very long time

469
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:20,320
so this gray stuff up here is then this

470
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:22,689
up here is a hot pile of manure that's

471
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,700
me on top of it I did walk up on top of

472
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,670
it so it's a pretty good-sized pile of

473
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,069
manure it was 160 degrees Fahrenheit so

474
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,550
we had good heat in that so we could use

475
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:34,808
that if we needed to for cover material

476
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:36,879
and for other stuff because it would

477
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:39,339
cook the birds and and they would

478
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:44,980
degrade in in somewhere around 15 16

479
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:47,049
days all different ages so you can see

480
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,490
they get really messy there hey they

481
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,710
have bad hair days when they are

482
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,150
starting to go down you can see over

483
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,650
here these guys their feathers are

484
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,450
sticking up and I only worked with

485
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,879
turkeys Mary only works with chickens as

486
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,889
a

487
00:22:55,878 --> 00:23:01,788
but there was no rhyme or reason to that

488
00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:05,448
so all different all different ages we

489
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:08,598
did bring the littlest so the babies we

490
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:10,548
brought in with with the adults with

491
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:12,678
some of the adults because they needed

492
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,528
to get access to that barn right away

493
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:25,629
and Efus allowed them to move them from

494
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:32,148
one barn to another barn yep you know

495
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:35,328
the barns in in California North Dakota

496
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:37,458
were beautiful they were sealed they

497
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:38,690
were contained they were good barnes

498
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:42,318
they were a lot better than what mary

499
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,999
had to deal with you could play football

500
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:47,959
inside if you needed to they were really

501
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:49,969
good sized barns in California it was

502
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:52,339
pretty ridiculous they had curtains so

503
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:54,078
they didn't have containment really so

504
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:55,759
they were just curtains over here or

505
00:23:54,078 --> 00:24:01,459
would have been curtains over there but

506
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:03,769
they were open there was a a train track

507
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:06,440
right over here and they had a dinner

508
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:09,558
train that came by every Western they

509
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,548
did have to change their their process

510
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,009
because they were showing off

511
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:15,168
agriculture so they did shut the train

512
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:17,778
down for for a little while and they

513
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:20,239
didn't bring it by this area but it's

514
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:24,608
Modesto so you know you might as well be

515
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:27,669
looking at the agriculture I guess so

516
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:30,168
just a couple of things in these photos

517
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,969
well we could use was Bobcats we're

518
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,429
using the little Bobcats because the

519
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:37,578
ceilings are so low the waters are there

520
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:39,019
we had to dump all the waters they had

521
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:42,888
to be pulled up so that we didn't

522
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:47,419
destroy them there are misters up here

523
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:51,858
as well and I think that's it for that

524
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:53,809
one and this is a pile of feed so what

525
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,308
we did was we just train we just

526
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,658
directed all the feed right into the

527
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:58,519
barn so it could all be pushed together

528
00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:00,319
and we could compost all of it because

529
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,730
all that stuff has to be sanitized

530
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:07,279
anything that's on the farm

531
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:09,670
sanitized one of the things that we

532
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:15,619
ended up having to do with this farm was

533
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:19,340
this piece these birds had died from the

534
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:21,319
avian influenza so we didn't have to use

535
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:22,939
any foam in here when we add phone to it

536
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,829
we're adding thousands of gallons of

537
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,390
water to it so we're working the two

538
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:28,220
different mediums and people had to get

539
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,020
used to that the fact that we this is

540
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,029
going to be different these piles

541
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:34,160
because we didn't have any moisture in

542
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,099
there any extra moisture in there we're

543
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,259
extremely dry so what we did was we put

544
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:41,599
the foggers on in those buildings and

545
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,829
added moisture to those piles and then

546
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,679
the temperatures went up pretty well

547
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,460
because they were so dry that they were

548
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,070
boisar was just too little for

549
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,600
composting actually occur but this is

550
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:53,419
what they should look like they should

551
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,189
be long piles we shouldn't have any you

552
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,870
know maybe some feathers but even

553
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,730
feathers we want everything covered so

554
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:00,319
everything has to be covered with carbon

555
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,819
and you have to have some kind of

556
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,529
material the manure could be used over

557
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:05,359
top other things could be used over

558
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:08,420
other carbon sources could be used over

559
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:13,339
top but we have to have everything well

560
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,710
covered back to South Dakota what we do

561
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,240
is we have to take that clumped manure

562
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,319
that's underneath the bedding and manure

563
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,940
that's underneath the the birds because

564
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,789
these are all on the floor there's no

565
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,009
cages there's nothing happening there so

566
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:31,369
we could just take the loader and go

567
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:32,869
down the middle row and clear that out

568
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:34,369
then we put carbon on top of that

569
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:38,689
because we have to have that air flowing

570
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:41,209
from the bottom so put the carbon on top

571
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,019
and then we took birds from the sides

572
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:47,120
and loaded those back on there was

573
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,339
controversy over whether we should be

574
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,669
making a mixed Center more like a

575
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:55,519
Twinkie so we would have carbon down

576
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,900
then we should mix them and then we

577
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,450
would put the carbon over top so there

578
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,009
was there still controversy over that we

579
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,860
prefer the layered method because we're

580
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:09,650
moving the birds less we're but not

581
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,909
creating a bio aerosol there when we're

582
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,140
working with them because we already

583
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,630
have to move them so they're already

584
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,400
make

585
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,870
with carbon they're already mixing with

586
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:24,480
the clump to the newer that's underneath

587
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:26,429
them so 60,000 turkeys here and that's

588
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,740
what we really should be looking like it

589
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,850
should look like toward the end I have

590
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,410
another picture that will show you

591
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,000
there's a little bit of material on the

592
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,009
floor but the floor should be pretty

593
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,769
clean even though they're dirt floors

594
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:42,900
most the buildings that I was in had

595
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:45,240
dirt floors but it should be a nice long

596
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,470
window and they were you know like I

597
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,500
said we could play football in those

598
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,240
buildings this is a clean floor so there

599
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,000
was one guy that was on the loader and

600
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,009
he just would go sailing around all the

601
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,359
polls and get it all off around the

602
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,339
poles he didn't have to do it manually

603
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,119
he was actually able to pick it up and

604
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:05,339
then after that a cleaning company would

605
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,229
come in and disinfect so when this barn

606
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:10,230
this barn was ready to be disinfected at

607
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,299
this point but that's because we moved

608
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:18,960
the baby birds out of this one and into

609
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:21,139
a different one temperatures we didn't

610
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,630
have any rules for releasing the piles

611
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:28,020
so when are we finished when have we

612
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,410
disinfected and I thought I always

613
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:34,019
thought in my head well we'd be testing

614
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,820
X amount of days in six days we'd be

615
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:38,759
testing those files to make sure that we

616
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,189
didn't have any virus left in the piles

617
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,809
that's not what was happening that's not

618
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,360
what the government was paying for so

619
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:48,599
what they were doing was and we do this

620
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,349
also we regulate by process in New York

621
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:54,359
State we regulate a lot by process so

622
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:56,519
the only rules that we have for

623
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,500
composting that one of the few rules

624
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,049
that we have for composting is the EPA

625
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,319
503 s and that's for bio solids it's for

626
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,720
for a human manure so we used those

627
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,460
because we knew that we could that we

628
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,339
could count on that because it had been

629
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,190
tested and also Virginia's had a lot of

630
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:15,990
low path AI that they've done some work

631
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,759
with but some of the air piles have SAT

632
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,950
for seven years because the farmers

633
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,740
don't have the confidence to say oh yeah

634
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:27,259
I'm going to flip spread that on my

635
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:32,269
on my farm and so there's a lot of that

636
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:35,000
what do we do composting should be

637
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:38,769
indoors as much as possible and outdoors

638
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,769
with his little movement as possible

639
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,150
should we leave the fans on I thought we

640
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,610
should cut a big filter and put it up on

641
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,769
the fan so that we weren't releasing so

642
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:50,750
that everything was was filtered before

643
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:54,109
it went out of the barns but that never

644
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:56,869
got any traction so we've just aerated

645
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:59,750
the bombs and and we spread the disease

646
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,969
I mean as as you can imagine 50 million

647
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,400
Birds it was spreading and in some

648
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,710
places in in Minnesota where Mary was in

649
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,080
Iowa we had massive spread in those

650
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,920
those states in North Dakota we only had

651
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,569
two incidents California we had the one

652
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,759
some other states we did have problems

653
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:18,759
with with disease transfer so

654
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:33,648
we had a new outbreak this year so we

655
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,380
have an outbreak in Indiana right now

656
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:39,889
and it's we talked about it being right

657
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,340
now because we it is existing all of the

658
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,200
birds are in piles but but it's only one

659
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,759
incident it seems like everything was

660
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,890
contained there was a high path pharm

661
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,970
and then it was surrounded by a couple

662
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,769
of low path farms so they've got that

663
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,380
contained and we haven't had any more

664
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,480
outbreaks at this point but we were

665
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,010
going into this in the winter and I said

666
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,819
you know we have this phone call every

667
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:06,470
Wednesday to talk about this stuff as

668
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:14,210
you can see we have kind of an exciting

669
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:16,308
life we talk about dead stuff anyway we

670
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,130
had to deal with cold weather wheezing

671
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:20,359
Birds frozen birds and all that kind of

672
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,490
stuff and it's different to be

673
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,829
composting to start composting at those

674
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,079
times a year so make sure making sure

675
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:29,569
that the Windrose were taller bigger

676
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:32,089
that we weren't putting frozen birds in

677
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:36,918
that we had good chunky material in

678
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:40,579
there if we have to put frozen birds in

679
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,380
the pile then we want to probably add

680
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:45,710
some of that hot manure that was out on

681
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,620
that that was composted and you know the

682
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,509
lesson one of the lesson learned lessons

683
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,879
learned here is that the farmers really

684
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,829
has to be composting they really have to

685
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,500
be composting their manure and their

686
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,689
routine mortality they call it the

687
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,048
routine mortality so that they have

688
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,639
practice number one and they have they

689
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:07,190
understand what materials work and what

690
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:09,168
materials don't work and if they had the

691
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,120
hot compost the hot manure compost on

692
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:16,070
farm then they can use that in a cold

693
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,509
situation we also can use other things

694
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,819
the leaf and yard waste compost

695
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:23,470
woodchips other things are hot in the

696
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:25,788
winter and we can bring those things in

697
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,028
birds can be incorporated into piles

698
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:32,148
frozen but they're not going to start

699
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:34,369
heating up until the outside temperature

700
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:36,558
the air temperature heats up so until it

701
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,259
warms up that's not going to happen one

702
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,680
time we put roadkill into a pile and it

703
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,450
was

704
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,690
arch and it was 5 degrees out that day

705
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:48,080
and the pile just froze they were frozen

706
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,990
beer and it just went down and this is

707
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:54,230
in a different situation the hot the

708
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:56,960
pile started warming up in May so you

709
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:04,430
know we used to keep ice in carbon to

710
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:06,200
keep it cold keep keep ice partially

711
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,730
frozen piles can heat up so if they've

712
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,650
already started one or they have some

713
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,990
heat in the pile it will ripple down the

714
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,640
pile so we've done that before and that

715
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,890
works pretty well so a lot of times

716
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,950
we're doing these in what we call the

717
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:23,360
lasagna method layers and will do them

718
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,370
will if we don't have all the birds at

719
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,559
one time we'll build a pile here that's

720
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,269
hot then we're adding some other birds

721
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,369
adding others in the winter through the

722
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:36,279
winter or cows or whatever and we're

723
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:36,279
adding those new winter and it heats up

724
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,330
compost covers could be used but then

725
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,059
they asked with that early on we're

726
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:50,470
considered experts so they asked us a

727
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,879
lot of these questions sometimes they

728
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:57,160
listen to us and sometimes they don't

729
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:58,300
we've had that experience but you know

730
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,590
at first I'm thinking that's just

731
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,669
another waste product we really don't

732
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:06,039
want to do that so we also can use those

733
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:09,250
if we have to to inflate to keep

734
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,860
moisture in and out but we also can do

735
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,420
that with a biofilter of carbon so we

736
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,700
can put wood chips over top of any of

737
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:18,880
these and accomplish the same thing so

738
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,609
we prefer to do that that way and in New

739
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:26,410
York we tend to regulation wise we tend

740
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:28,180
to do that when we have a problem when

741
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,009
managing the frozen piles the clock

742
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:35,889
starts when it gets to 110 or 36 c so

743
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:40,150
you know you can say okay we need this

744
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,829
much more time but that doesn't work I'm

745
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:52,000
going to talk yeah I'm going to talk

746
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:53,529
about that 05 must have gone out I have

747
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,050
a slide there I muscle it must have

748
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,060
dropped out anyway so what do we do

749
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,620
after we built these files we're taking

750
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:01,420
temperatures or somebody's taking

751
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,130
temperatures usually the APHIS vets or

752
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,720
somebody on site will be taking

753
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,610
temperatures after we leave we're there

754
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,339
to build the piles to make sure they are

755
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,620
working then somebody monitors because

756
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,970
there's no sense in us being there for

757
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:17,529
through that time period in 14 days and

758
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:20,799
this was being debated as we were

759
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,400
building piles in 14 days we decided

760
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,900
that the pile could be turned once and

761
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,450
at that point if we've met the

762
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,300
temperatures if we've gotten at that

763
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:34,509
point we were looking at 133 to 150 if

764
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,700
we had gotten that for ten days then ten

765
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,550
days in that time period in that pile

766
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:44,230
then we could turn that pile what we do

767
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:46,870
or three days I'm sorry three days then

768
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,909
add 14 days we could turn that pile and

769
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:50,799
what we would do is at that point we

770
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:52,000
would turn the pile outside because if

771
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,980
we've gotten those temperatures then

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,230
we've killed the virus

773
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,210
and then that could be moved so we've

774
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,250
moved that outdoors to finish composting

775
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,690
but at that point it was sanitized and

776
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,789
that's what we were trying to accomplish

777
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,369
at that point then they can go in and

778
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:10,230
take care of those buildings and

779
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:11,820
disinfect the buildings so in just in

780
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,849
general understand where the farm and

781
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:19,470
farmer are coming from take weather into

782
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:21,989
account assess which are the best

783
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,659
methods to dispose of the residuals all

784
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:29,358
the materials the dead stock the feed

785
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:29,358
the eggs water all that kind of stuff

786
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,420
develop guidance that's flexible because

787
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,829
every situations different so and every

788
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,630
carbon source is going to be different

789
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,920
and so we've got to be able to be

790
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,099
flexible enough to be able to

791
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,780
accommodate and get the job done are we

792
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:51,139
more prepared than before the outbreak

793
00:36:45,780 --> 00:37:00,780
yeah we're definitely more prepared so

794
00:36:51,139 --> 00:37:01,949
that's it yes and then we've discussed

795
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,540
it when you don't reach your

796
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:06,750
temperatures because there are about 12

797
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:08,550
of us that are out there were 12 of us

798
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,619
that from different parts of the country

799
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,810
and two of those were Canadians so they

800
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:19,140
were bringing them down to do some of

801
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:21,519
this yeah yeah yeah so basically the

802
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:25,000
rule that we were going by the guy

803
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:29,199
503 world for bio colors which basically

804
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,530
says in a static system three days at

805
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:36,909
131 x is expected and it's not stop at

806
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,290
131 a percent or of aesthetic is longer

807
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:44,019
you're right okay so it's a time window

808
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:48,489
Oh three days at 131 or yes Oh or higher

809
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:51,849
okay says that it is basically safe to

810
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:55,179
use in any situation okay that's why we

811
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:57,429
get Milwaukee's manure in our it loads

812
00:37:55,179 --> 00:38:00,009
if we want to put it on our garden

813
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:01,869
Morgan I'm work yeah yeah so for this

814
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,030
but that's the only rule there ever was

815
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:06,219
do people just sort of use it as a guide

816
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:10,960
post now but if you look at all of the

817
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:16,779
literature on what is in activating the

818
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:20,260
AI virus it's 130 will fill it in 30 30

819
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:22,390
minutes yep okay and then lower

820
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:29,440
temperatures will take a little bit

821
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:31,269
longer but even if 35 as no no no much

822
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,289
so even it like no you're going to earn

823
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:37,329
my degrees Fahrenheit it will die it

824
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:41,050
will innovate inactivate within like a

825
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:43,599
week and a half the a is it's very not

826
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,750
stable it's like e.coli it's like you

827
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,449
know all those so we work however it can

828
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,150
persist in the fields in a pond or

829
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:54,730
whatever for a long period of time right

830
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,230
is water in the warm water better that's

831
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,318
all

832
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,690
the other until but in a contained

833
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:04,268
situation you know in that way you can

834
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:07,358
carry it on your shoes reallys is

835
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:10,239
probably more how it spreads then choose

836
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:13,420
entire tire everything the air results

837
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,838
because if in the chicken barn 5 next to

838
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:19,389
each other only two barns died that air

839
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:21,849
had to have been going in between and

840
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:25,838
those other three barns vids guys but so

841
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:27,970
what we finally got out you know it was

842
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,170
sort of a case-by-case basis and I don't

843
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:32,159
know if you have more questions usually

844
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:36,278
the answer and composting in Japan no

845
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,078
but if you took a case by case and wolf

846
00:39:36,278 --> 00:39:40,449
its friends and temperatures that they

847
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,200
were reaching as long as they were

848
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:50,139
thermophilic so anywhere between 10 4

849
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:52,268
and 4 110 and 150 you were going to have

850
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:54,489
the right situations get rid of that to

851
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:57,368
inactivate that violence yes and we have

852
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:59,108
evidence that at 90 Fahrenheit we can in

853
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:02,349
that in that regards and I covered

854
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:05,848
ourselves without research sanitation of

855
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:10,749
the barns themselves only needed to be

856
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:12,640
like two days at 105 yep so why are we

857
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:14,980
treating the compost so differently and

858
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,838
making such a more stringent you know

859
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:20,400
basically we were more worried about the

860
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:23,048
bird decomposing and there not being any

861
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,509
flesh waste or anything like that left

862
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:29,259
when the turn or when we release the

863
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:33,489
public yeah you want a sitter so no lo

864
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:36,219
pap is always circulated in Birds almost

865
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:38,710
always and it causes some distress maybe

866
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:41,949
a couple of birds died because it's

867
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:45,849
ruffled feathers ish cuz rip causes loss

868
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:49,719
of egg production but in general and you

869
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:52,059
probably chicken farmer even a even one

870
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,209
who have them in their backyard probably

871
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:57,640
has low pass at most time but doesn't

872
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,429
necessarily notice anything the high

873
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:03,998
path is actually when you carry the

874
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:06,440
virus that's carried by wild birds into

875
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:09,199
a Lopez situation and the virus

876
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,440
mutate right okay and then it becomes

877
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,439
type ad and it almost always immediately

878
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,740
kills within you know two or three days

879
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,659
of getting the virus which is why we're

880
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:22,789
not so sure that it actually is airborne

881
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:25,009
right even though they say it is right

882
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:27,529
because those other cousins TTYL yeah

883
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,510
and if you're going in and but what the

884
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,829
rules are it's a reportable disease so

885
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,800
the rules are you have to kill them all

886
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:37,310
and get rid of it you don't want to tap

887
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,440
it and they look at you they look at a

888
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:42,259
whole radius also so they're looking at

889
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,960
a radius so farms in the area are also

890
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,060
check backyard flocks are checked three

891
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,829
miles and 10,000 via first of your own

892
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:51,139
you are not allowed to go out and test

893
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:54,500
right because you don't want to bring it

894
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:56,838
back your bird quick you know things

895
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,980
like that studies and I think that

896
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:02,449
actually in some of those situations

897
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,809
they put catchments out there for the by

898
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:07,939
the Panda and they were within like I

899
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:09,529
think it was like three feet bread

900
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,349
houses they found the virus is beyond

901
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,810
that they didn't right right and what

902
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:17,690
they may do as they they may just put a

903
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:20,358
so to speak a condom on the fan and

904
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,920
bring it down to the ground so it would

905
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:23,269
just take everything to the ground and

906
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,730
put it through a biofilter and then you

907
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:27,559
deal with it there instead of going

908
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,619
further out so it's either that or some

909
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:34,159
kind of filtration wild birds it's wild

910
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:37,068
birds well it could have more to do with

911
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:42,108
that who knows I don't think we know

912
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:43,789
that certainly could be hmm yeah but

913
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:46,130
this definitely spread through the

914
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:48,440
migration routes and luckily didn't hit

915
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,869
the eastern you can see why way each

916
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,110
time to buy with it

917
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:55,109
when the birds are flying over that yeah

918
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:04,559
this has been a production of Cornell

919
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,559
University on the web at cornell edu
