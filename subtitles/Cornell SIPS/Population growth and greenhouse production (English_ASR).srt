1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
so what i really did at cornell uh was

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,160
be involved in the lettuce project and

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,480
this is a

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
picture of of one of the setups that

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
that we looked at

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
and the idea was it was funded by the

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,320
the nysec the local power company

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
nyserda and at the time eserco

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,840
energy research and development

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,839
corporation i think it was

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,919
they were interested in selling more

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,759
power more electricity and and we of

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
course felt that if you want to grow a

16
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,320
crop in a relatively dark environment in

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
upstate new york you can only do that

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,679
successfully if you add lots of

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,280
supplemental lighting

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,039
so we picked lettuce

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
and i don't remember anymore exactly why

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
we picked lettuce we thought at the time

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,960
i think that was a great idea because it

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,280
was

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,079
a so-called simple crop to grow that

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
turned out not to be the case

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,478
we picked lettuce

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,118
and the objective of the work was to try

29
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,519
to grow it as fast as possible

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:13,280
so have minimal time in the greenhouse

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,438
and also have it finished in the same

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
period of time so in the independent of

33
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,519
the weather conditions we wanted to have

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
the lettuce finish at the same

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,959
date so the number of days it took from

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,039
seeding to harvesting was always

37
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,399
supposed to be the same in our system so

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
you have to keep that in mind when you

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
think about our our system and the

40
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
approach that we took

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
the reasons of course is that greenhouse

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
space is very expensive and

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
and so you need to get the crop in and

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
out quickly and we couldn't wait uh

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,079
particularly when you think about

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
changing lighting conditions we couldn't

47
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,798
wait we didn't afford ourselves to wait

48
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,399
and grow a crop over more days when the

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
light conditions were not favorable so

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
supplemental lighting was used and you

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,798
see here the setup that we used

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
uh using high pressure sodium lamps in a

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,840
specifically designed array to get high

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
uniformity

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
and the highest intensity possible

56
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,718
given

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,478
the limited resource in terms of

58
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,359
electricity that we wanted to use for

59
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,199
for growing this crop

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
so one of the the results of that work

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,119
was here you see

62
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,958
a graph that shows you the accumulated

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,719
light conditions since seeding on the

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
horizontal axis on the vertical axis you

65
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,598
see the shoot dry mass or shoot dry

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,680
weight and you get a very nice linear

67
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,280
line not surprising when you think about

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,159
a crop like lettuce that is a vegetative

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
crop

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,878
so there's not really all that much

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
significant about this graph except for

72
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,199
the fact that you're looking at 35 data

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,719
points and each of those data points was

74
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,199
a single treatment and each treatment

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,318
started with about 800 seats

76
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,159
so the the amount of work that went into

77
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,000
giving you this graph this this very

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,680
nice linear relationship

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
was quite significant and many people

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
were involved in this effort and it took

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
many many

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,360
hours of work to to get all these data

83
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,359
points for this graph

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
another thing we looked at was was leaf

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
area versus

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
the horizontal axis

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,439
shoot fresh mass

88
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,280
and on the other

89
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,000
on the right hand side on the vertical

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,400
axis we looked at the dry mass so we got

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,598
nice correlations between leaf area

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
and and

93
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,359
shoot fresh mass as well as the dry mass

94
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,840
and the fresh mass

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
again not particularly surprising except

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
i want to mention that if you look at

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
the blue line you see a very nice linear

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
relationship between dry mass and fresh

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
mass and this resulted very quickly in

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
significant discussions with

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,039
particularly with professor langhans

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
because the staff obviously was more

103
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,519
interested in taking the fresh mass and

104
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,000
not do the

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
tedious dry weight measurements dry mass

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,759
measurements

107
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
but he stood his grounds and we lost out

108
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,639
and so we did

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,200
continue

110
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,000
uh weighing uh plants after they went

111
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,919
through the drying cycle and and

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,199
we had to do a lot of extra work because

113
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,119
of that but

114
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,639
to his credit that also meant that we

115
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,799
had better results in the end and more

116
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,518
publishable results

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
when we were done

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
so everything was going nice and

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,158
smoothly until we hit a significant

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
problem and the problem was called

121
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,199
tipwork

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,238
and tipburn is a physiological disorder

123
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,238
and again i'm an engineer so you have to

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,159
ask the plant physiologist for more

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,758
specific details but my understanding is

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
that it is caused by a calcium

127
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,280
deficiency the plant is growing very

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
rapidly

129
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,039
and calcium is not taken up quickly

130
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,279
enough by the roots and not

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
taken to the young

132
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,679
rapidly expanding leaf tissue and as a

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
result we see die back of that leaf

134
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,319
tissue and you get a lettuce plant that

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
looks much like this and of course

136
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,439
although you get the dry weight

137
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,360
accumulation you can't sell the plant

138
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,439
because nobody in the right mind would

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,879
go to wegmans and buy this this head of

140
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,120
lettuce

141
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,600
so we we were stuck we were trying to

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
push the plants as fast as we could

143
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
to try to get them out of the greenhouse

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,879
as quickly as possible

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
but we didn't reach

146
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,120
we couldn't grow and past a certain

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,120
point because we started seeing this tip

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
burn issue from happening

149
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,319
so we had many discussions about what we

150
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,719
could do about it we looked at papers

151
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,839
and we found a paper from colleagues in

152
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,759
japan

153
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,000
that actually blew

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
air on lettuce plants to try to increase

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
plant transpiration and therefore

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,960
increase the the uptake and transport of

157
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
calcium from the roots to the young

158
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,159
growing tips

159
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
and they seem to have some success and

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
so we talked about

161
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
how we could do this envisioning a large

162
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
greenhouse setup with little tubes that

163
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,560
were blowing air on individual heads of

164
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,240
lettuce and we quickly realized that

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
this was not going to work in a

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
practical

167
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,198
system

168
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,520
so i mentioned here we did a covert

169
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
experiment and covert i have to explain

170
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,120
was because professor langhans was out

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
of town at the time

172
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
and and um

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
we had discussed this idea but i think

174
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
he wasn't very much in favor of it

175
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,839
and so

176
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
we took the opportunity i think he was

177
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,638
either

178
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
at a conference or he was

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,960
going for winter break in florida and so

180
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,800
we took that opportunity to put

181
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,799
something together very simply and an

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,879
inflated plastic tube with little holes

183
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,079
along the side positioned directly

184
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,319
overhead

185
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,918
two rows of lettuce plants and we we

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
grew the plants and looked at the

187
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,120
results and much to our surprise the the

188
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,360
idea worked perfectly in in fact the

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,478
plants that received additional air

190
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
supply

191
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,159
with this system did not get any tip

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
burn where neighboring plants did have

193
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
significant amount of tipper

194
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,198
and so

195
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,239
after we saw the result ourselves we

196
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
could

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
report back to professor langest when he

198
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,879
came back from his trip or from his

199
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,439
vacation

200
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,199
uh that indeed we discovered that this

201
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,399
was a great idea and we should

202
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,879
investigate more

203
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,598
and so he then quickly told us then

204
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,319
to use turbulator fans overhead fans

205
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,719
that

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
could blow large amounts of air

207
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
vertically down on the lettuce crop to

208
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,879
help increase plant transpiration and

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,598
overcome this this dipper and issue

210
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,159
and so this is what we we started doing

211
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,439
and this is how we overcome the typical

212
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
issue issue but to a certain extent

213
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,240
and at certain extent this i'm trying to

214
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,159
show you here in this graph where on the

215
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
horizontal axis you look at dry mass

216
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
accumulation on the vertical axis you

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,879
look at water use we carefully tracked

218
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,478
water use of plants in our system

219
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,519
and we could come up with

220
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,279
these lines and these are

221
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,359
regression lines so they're not the

222
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,839
actual data but the result of the the

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
data that we collected to try to

224
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,159
polish up the graph a little bit but you

225
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,399
can see here there's different

226
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
light treatments that have different

227
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,318
rates of water use

228
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
as the plants are growing through the

229
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,280
different stages to final harvest

230
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
and so we surmised from this craft that

231
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,239
that you needed to have a minimum rate

232
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,839
of water use or plant transpiration

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
in order to overcome this tip burn

234
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,079
problem you can see in the top of the

235
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,598
slide that treatments up to 16 moles of

236
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,680
light or so did not

237
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,759
suffer from tip burn where treatments

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,800
above that 20 and 22 moles in the bottom

239
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
did receive or did experience tip burn

240
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
issues

241
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
so this is why

242
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,758
if you've been at all familiar with the

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,160
cea program this is why

244
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,800
we typically recommend that 16 to 70

245
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,639
moles of light is the limit

246
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
using the cornell system for growing

247
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,319
lettuce

248
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
because of this different issue and

249
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
because of the fact that if you use

250
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,200
additional measures to increase plant

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,038
transpiration like these turbulator fans

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
we can overcome tip burn but only to a

253
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,718
certain extent if you still try to push

254
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
the plants even harder you do get the

255
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,879
dry mass accumulation but you don't get

256
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,839
you don't overcome the different issue

257
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,799
we also dabbled in in co2 experiments

258
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
where we

259
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,039
enrich the environment and i i say

260
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
trading here with quotes and what i mean

261
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,439
with that i want to explain with this

262
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,720
graph

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
if you look on the

264
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
vertical axis you see the shoot dry mass

265
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,879
again

266
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,039
and you see a dark line a black line at

267
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,720
seven grams and that's the the target

268
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,199
weight that we were trying to shoot for

269
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,120
that corresponds if you go back to the

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
linear relationship between fresh mass

271
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,000
and dry mass that corresponds to a fresh

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
mass of approximately 150 grams which

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,559
was the target mass we were trying to

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,320
shoot for so the 7 grams is our target

275
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,599
size of planet we are trying to shoot

276
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
for

277
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
and if you look then at the different

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
light intensities indicated by different

279
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
colored lines here

280
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,599
and you follow that seven grand line uh

281
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,319
from left to right you see it in the sex

282
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,639
with the 17 moles first at approximately

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,959
ambient co2 concentrations of course

284
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,639
this is 20 years ago when co2

285
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,000
concentration ambient was still around

286
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,679
350 right now it's approaching 400.

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
but as you go further to the right you

288
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,838
see that that horizontal line at 7 grams

289
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
intersects with different

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,240
lines of of light intensity and they

291
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,759
correspond to different co2

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
concentrations if you look at the

293
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,600
horizontal axis so what i'm trying to

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
tell you here is that we found out that

295
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,480
if instead of growing the plants at 17

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,958
moles at ambient co2 concentrations you

297
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
could also grow a plant at 12 moles

298
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,119
where you had to increase the the co2

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,759
concentration to approximately 1300 or

300
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,799
so micro moles per moles or parts per

301
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,319
million

302
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,039
and this is what i mean by trading we

303
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,360
discovered that within limits

304
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,838
you could decide instead of adding more

305
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
supplemental lighting which is very

306
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,120
expensive you could you could add or

307
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,800
increase the co2 concentration and get

308
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,799
the same end result

309
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,199
and so this was an interesting

310
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,639
discovery and and i think when you think

311
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,079
about commercial production this can

312
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,159
have some significant implications

313
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,199
because obviously it will be cheaper to

314
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,519
add co2 compared to adding supplemental

315
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
lighting

316
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
and then all that work resulted in a set

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,078
of growth curves we use the second order

318
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,719
exponential polynomial you see the

319
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,039
equation in the box upright

320
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
where we only have one

321
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
variable the the daily light integral

322
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,239
the amount of light we provided on a

323
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,958
daily basis to the plants that we

324
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
provide that light every day to try to

325
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,958
keep the plants at their fixed growing

326
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
rate to make sure we reach the target

327
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,399
harvest date

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,639
and you can see here for different daily

329
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,919
light integrals what the growth curve

330
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,679
looked like

331
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:28,519
for the varieties that we were using at

332
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,519
the time which was austenita bib lettuce

333
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
we also looked at efficiency

334
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,838
rates uh so how much energy do you need

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
to provide and what do you get in return

336
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,600
in terms of biomass

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,000
and more recently i found a paper by

338
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,360
monteith in that from 1977 that looked

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
at

340
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
efficiency rates in terms of the amount

341
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
of light it was intercepted versus the

342
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,159
dry matter production

343
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,319
um

344
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,240
and he looked at at outdoor crops he

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,760
looked at apples barley potatoes and

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,959
sugar beets and you see these colored

347
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,159
lines here

348
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,000
indicating

349
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,000
the data that he found

350
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,879
and then from this data i can calculate

351
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,240
an average efficiency taking too into

352
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,799
account that the heat of combustion for

353
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,278
dry matter is approximately 7.5

354
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,958
kilojoules per gram so i could look at

355
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
the energy that you provided through

356
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,719
sunlight versus the energy that you you

357
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,240
gain from

358
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
dry matter production and then you can

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,759
calculate an efficiency

360
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,479
and then the little blue line

361
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,799
towards the origin of the graph here is

362
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
is the line for our lettuce plants

363
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,399
and now you think that it looks like the

364
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,399
lettuce is not doing so well but you

365
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,799
have to keep in mind that the lettuce

366
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,078
crops that we were growing only required

367
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,599
a 24 day time period in the greenhouse

368
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,559
we grew it for 11 days in the growth

369
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
chamber and then 24 more days in the

370
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,199
in the

371
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,159
greenhouse so after

372
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,240
35 days or five weeks the plants were

373
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,159
finished and we reached the 150 gram

374
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,440
fresh matter

375
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,838
freshwater

376
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
target harvest size

377
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
so if you if you think about this the

378
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,240
outdoor crops can be grown only once in

379
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
outdoor season but the greenhouse crops

380
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,120
can be grown actually 15 times in the

381
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,680
same area in a greenhouse so multiply

382
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,759
both axis by 15 and you see that

383
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,759
the greenhouse crop was doing

384
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,159
significantly better than the field

385
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,159
crops

386
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
as i mentioned we did lots of

387
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,199
experiments

388
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
some were funny and some were

389
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
informative one of them that i liked

390
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,240
particularly

391
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,239
was this continuous production in this

392
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
case in nft or nutrient film technique

393
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
showing you the visual growth curve i

394
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,519
showed you the lines that we that we

395
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
calculated from the data that we

396
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
collected here you see actually in a

397
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,600
visual representation an actual

398
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,920
representation of what that growth curve

399
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,240
looks like so every day we would plant a

400
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,958
new row and move the rows up until we

401
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,839
finally ended up with a complete

402
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,559
picture of what every stage of the the

403
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,880
production looked like

404
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,399
we did the same for floating

405
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,320
systems

406
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
in the meantime we had visited a grower

407
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
in canada that was using these floating

408
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,159
systems and we we quickly realized the

409
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
benefits of this system

410
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,799
and and so we started working

411
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,559
on floating systems as well and here you

412
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,039
see the same idea

413
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,919
a visual representation of the growth

414
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,838
curve of lettuce plants in that floating

415
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,519
system

416
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
and then eventually and i'm sure

417
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,039
everybody here is familiar with us we

418
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,799
were able to and i think i still think

419
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,480
this is very remarkable out of the

420
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,479
research that we did

421
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
and this is to the credit of professors

422
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
uh langhans and and albright

423
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,319
they were able to convince our our

424
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
sponsors that it was a good idea to

425
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,920
build a demonstration facility and i

426
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,120
thought i don't think there are many

427
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,439
uh research projects that ultimately end

428
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
up in a significantly scaled

429
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,680
demonstration facility in which we were

430
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,959
going to demonstrate that this lattice

431
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,879
production system was going to work out

432
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,039
and that at that stage

433
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,559
the professor retired and i and i left

434
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,559
cornell

435
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,518
for for rutgers university so i'm

436
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,799
switching now to uh some of the work

437
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,959
that i've been involved with at rutgers

438
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,319
university and you quickly can see that

439
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,439
i'm switching to a totally different

440
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,600
crop

441
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
rutgers is is more known for their work

442
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,560
on tomatoes so when i came there i had

443
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
to switch my thinking from a

444
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,039
vegetative crop to a flowering crop like

445
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,639
like tomatoes and this is not a

446
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,639
particularly good picture of a tomato

447
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
plant but it has one feature that i

448
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,240
wanted you to look at which is the fact

449
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,039
that the stem here

450
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,919
is is cut and and the ruckus approach

451
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,439
was

452
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,120
a different approach for the traditional

453
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
tomato production system in the sense

454
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,519
that they decided to grow single cluster

455
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,000
or dual cluster

456
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,839
tomato plants and that meant that after

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
the first fruit cluster had started to

458
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,399
develop they would break off the

459
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
the growing tip

460
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,919
and and let the plant put all its

461
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,959
resources into

462
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,599
into

463
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,359
the few fruit that it was developing

464
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
before the plant was then discarded so

465
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
the cropping cycle was much

466
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,560
reduced in terms of time

467
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,560
but also the spacing was much increased

468
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,758
we could pack these plants much closer

469
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,838
together

470
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,000
in the system that we were looking at at

471
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,759
least theoretically it appeared that a

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
system like this would be as productive

473
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,320
as the more traditional lean and lower

474
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,720
system that is that you can see in most

475
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,519
commercial greenhouse operations

476
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,120
so i'm switching to a tomato crop

477
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,078
some of the early work was funded by

478
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
nasa

479
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,039
and this is also a bit of a contentious

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,360
point uh with the cornell group here

481
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,278
at the time uh rutgers had a an end

482
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
scored project and and

483
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,958
nasa funded project

484
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,879
where cornell also uh

485
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,799
was in the running and trying to get the

486
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,679
funding but it went to rutgers at the

487
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,559
time

488
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,958
and so um by leaving here i lucked out

489
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,919
and and and ended up being part of that

490
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,479
that

491
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,559
the winning effort at rutgers although

492
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
when i was here at uh

493
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,078
at cornell i was at the losing end

494
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,838
because we didn't get the funding

495
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,519
but anyway from a nasa point of view

496
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,838
and you have to think now about growing

497
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,679
crops for space applications where you

498
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,240
if you do long duration space missions

499
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
you you want to be able to provide your

500
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,640
crew with with nutritious food and it's

501
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,880
probably not likely that you can bring

502
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,799
uh as it is economical to bring all your

503
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,079
food with you so you have to produce as

504
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,679
you are traveling for example the mars

505
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,519
it becomes important to know more about

506
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,519
these crops and so nasa was interested

507
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,759
in funding some research and looking at

508
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,200
these crops and so

509
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,480
what we discovered when we looked at

510
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
this and when we started working in this

511
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
area that if you if you look at

512
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
published work in most cases people have

513
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,798
have looked at tomato production

514
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
extensively but the conditions under

515
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,079
which the tomatoes were grown under were

516
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,200
always kept constant in other words you

517
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,119
had certain set points that you

518
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,279
typically followed to to produce a crop

519
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,119
and and nasa of course was interested in

520
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,519
in developing growth models that they

521
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,759
can then use to try to simulate what the

522
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,519
production might be when you fly

523
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,759
a system like that in space because they

524
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,200
wanted to start planning how much food

525
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,359
they could count on for the crews that

526
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,279
they were planning to take with them

527
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,558
and so we needed to have

528
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,399
growth models

529
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,038
for those particular applications but we

530
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
also knew that in the nasa system

531
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,879
it might not be inconceivable that there

532
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,880
were perturbations to those

533
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
environmental conditions because for

534
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,559
example the power that was required to

535
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
run the lights was needed for another

536
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,319
critical component in their in their

537
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
system

538
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,159
and so the perturbations were really

539
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,000
important and and we knew that the

540
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
perturbation studies were not done very

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,839
extensively certainly not on tomato

542
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,759
crops

543
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,639
and then by talking to our specialists

544
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,000
on tomato crops we knew that

545
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,120
the environmental conditions

546
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
environmental conditions during

547
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,199
flowering and fruit set were really

548
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,360
important and that starts around 55 days

549
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,798
after seeding for the particular system

550
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,038
that we were using

551
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,359
so those conditions if you if you do

552
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,440
perturbations in that time period and

553
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,439
that for our case it was about a

554
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
two-week time period then that can have

555
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,759
significant impact on on the quality and

556
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,759
the and the yield of the plants

557
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,440
and we also looked at harvesting the

558
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,599
plants at the typical breaker stage

559
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,240
which for a tomato plant means that the

560
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,599
color is just changing from green to to

561
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,599
slightly orange or pinkish

562
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,799
and as harvesting at a later date

563
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
because we felt and we had indications

564
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,960
that if you wait longer

565
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,120
you get better qualities aspects of your

566
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,759
of your fruit production and so indeed

567
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,359
as you can see on the bottom point here

568
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,839
we did find that there were significant

569
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,519
improvements if you wait longer

570
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,439
before you start harvesting the fruit

571
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,440
which is obviously not a major

572
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,639
surprise but it was it was nice that we

573
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,960
could now

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
have a quantitative way of of showing

575
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,558
this

576
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,759
so the work was done in growth chambers

577
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,440
mostly

578
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,319
so very familiar to the growth chambers

579
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,120
that you use at cornell here

580
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,439
we used a lot of mylar screening around

581
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,000
our plant stands to try to overcome the

582
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,600
issue of sight lighting so typically you

583
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,279
would have sight lighting issues and you

584
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,199
would remove

585
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,038
plants on the outside rows from your

586
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
experiments but since we had limited

587
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,200
area we wanted to include those plants

588
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,679
so we used those screens to to try to

589
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
overcome the side light issue

590
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,559
and

591
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,880
the way we did it we started plants all

592
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,158
in the same growth chamber and then

593
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
depending on the treatment they were

594
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
moved to different uh growth chambers to

595
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,000
to receive their treatment so of course

596
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,079
there are issues associated with when

597
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
you start moving plants you you disturb

598
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,240
them you stress them and and we had to

599
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,079
take that into account so it was not a

600
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,480
particularly easy

601
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,480
thing to do but we made the best of the

602
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
resources that we had available

603
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,279
and for those of you insiders in

604
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,280
controlled environment

605
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,599
work you can see here that we used

606
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,240
fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps

607
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,918
and

608
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,839
knowing from my time at cornell that

609
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
that the use of incandescent lamp is

610
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,359
somewhat contentious and i tried really

611
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,279
hard to convince my colleagues that we

612
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,798
should not be using them

613
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,399
but i lost obviously an argument and so

614
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,918
this is perhaps an institutional and

615
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,759
historical artifact that we still use

616
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,720
incandescent lamps for

617
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,240
for tomato production

618
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,480
switching to a different project but

619
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
still staying with the same crop

620
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,038
just like many other

621
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,480
universities including cornell

622
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,158
we were interested in high tunnel

623
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
production growers were interested in

624
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,000
particularly

625
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,759
and we got some seed money from our

626
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,119
college to investigate high tunnel

627
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,119
production

628
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,798
and we looked at

629
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,319
different sites we installed them in

630
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,679
different places across the state to

631
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,839
look at

632
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,679
different weather conditions

633
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,839
we looked at different orientations we

634
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
looked at tunnels with manual roll-up

635
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,959
sides we looked at tunnels with

636
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,360
automatic roll-up sides which meant you

637
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,519
had to have a motorized system with a

638
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,599
thermostat that would operate the

639
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,200
roll-up sides we looked at different

640
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,558
mulches different collet mulches for

641
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,159
tomato production

642
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,960
and and as you can see in the bottom

643
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,880
here we wrote an article

644
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,640
looking at additional

645
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
control measures such as an energy

646
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
curtain

647
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,639
that you would pull over the crop at

648
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,000
night to try to

649
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,440
maintain the temperature a little bit

650
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,839
longer

651
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,960
at optimum conditions or at least at

652
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
good growing conditions

653
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,519
as a side note i think we of course penn

654
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,119
state is really heavy and really big in

655
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,119
high tunnel research

656
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,959
we have been doing a little bit of it i

657
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,199
know that cornelis is doing a lot of

658
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,679
work in it too it seems to me that

659
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,519
across the region there should be more

660
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,759
collaboration among the various

661
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,599
institutions to try to

662
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,960
to not duplicate efforts because i think

663
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,519
some of that is going on at these

664
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,159
institutions

665
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,240
when i came to rutgers i inherited

666
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,480
a greenhouse shell so it wasn't looking

667
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,798
as nice as it looks in this picture

668
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,759
my predecessor was able to get funding

669
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,679
for the framework of a open roof

670
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,839
greenhouse system which is a newer

671
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
design that allows for

672
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,678
large amounts of air exchange to try to

673
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,279
keep the temperature inside pretty much

674
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
the same as outdoor conditions in the

675
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,798
summertime

676
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,279
which is typically not feasible when you

677
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,639
use mechanical ventilation systems

678
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,158
but if you have these open roof

679
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
greenhouses you can

680
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,640
get to

681
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,918
those conditions

682
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
so we

683
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,320
quickly

684
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,240
realized we needed to improve this

685
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,279
facility to get it up to a research

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,000
great facility and and gene reese

687
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,960
my graduate student and um technician at

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the time

689
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
uh

690
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,038
did the yeoman's work of getting this

691
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
facility in great shape

692
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,359
to do experimentation and as you can see

693
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,440
from the the reference here he also

694
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,158
looked into

695
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
a a heating system a floor heating

696
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,120
system

697
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,639
uh and look at the benefits of floor

698
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:51,199
heating for for crop production

699
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
so here you see the inside of greenhouse

700
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,600
it's a an ebon flood floor system which

701
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,278
is a very nice way of irrigating your

702
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,199
crop if you can grow them in pots and

703
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,400
sitting directly on the floor

704
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,278
and then embedded in that concrete layer

705
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,278
we installed a heating system a a

706
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,359
plastic pipe system through which we

707
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
pump uh hot water

708
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,278
and the way that system was designed is

709
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,759
shown in this graphic so you have your

710
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:19,599
concrete slab you have the heating pipes

711
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,119
and you have also the the the supply and

712
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,879
drainage system for your irrigation

713
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,719
system that ends up in an underground

714
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
storage tank

715
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,480
where you store your nutrient solution

716
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,480
to be ready for the next

717
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
irrigation cycle

718
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
so the top of the floor was carefully

719
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,599
designed so it had a good drainage

720
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,919
system we call it a w shape we had two

721
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,038
rows of holes down the length of the the

722
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,720
bay

723
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,879
that collect the nutrient solution after

724
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,319
the irrigation cycle and then drains it

725
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
back into the tank and we pump the

726
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,678
nutrient solution through the same

727
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,719
system back up onto the floor when the

728
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,720
plants require water

729
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
as i mentioned gene did a lot of work on

730
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,759
on developing a numerical model

731
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,798
and this is of course engineering

732
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,000
talk

733
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,079
to look at

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
how the heat is distributed in in these

735
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,720
systems and here you see

736
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,880
a section of a floor slab

737
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,480
as the box the bar and then some red

738
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
dots indicating the location of the

739
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,640
heating pipes and the colors are

740
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
indicating the different temperatures

741
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
at a particular moment in this

742
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,599
simulation run so you get an idea of the

743
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,679
type of work we did using that system

744
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
some of the results of those simulations

745
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,278
are shown in this graph

746
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,119
where on the horizontal axis you look at

747
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,038
the supply water temperature

748
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,278
and it's it's not likely that you will

749
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,720
ever go as high as 55 or 60 degrees

750
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,880
because at that temperature you will

751
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,640
likely cook the crop that sits on the

752
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,559
floor but you might go as high as about

753
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,000
50 degrees or so

754
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,519
but what we're looking at here is how

755
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,759
much heat is actually coming off the

756
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,278
surface the top surface of the floor and

757
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,240
how much heat is going

758
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,919
uh is directed towards the the bottom or

759
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
the under layer the under layer of

760
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,880
ground underneath the floor represented

761
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,320
by the blue lines

762
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,159
because we were interested in the

763
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,639
question do you need to insulate

764
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,400
underneath a concrete floor to try to

765
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,559
prevent heat from escaping to the

766
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,720
outside that you can't use for

767
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,480
heating your greenhouse environment

768
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,919
and then in addition to that we looked

769
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,519
at and we could do this of course

770
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
because we had a simulation model we

771
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,519
looked at two different

772
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,600
pipe designs one we will use three

773
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,359
quarter inch pipes at

774
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,119
12 inch spacings

775
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,519
or we used which is more common these

776
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,759
days a half inch diameter pipe

777
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,599
at nine inch spacings so these are just

778
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,599
design features that you can incorporate

779
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,038
in your floor heating system

780
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,558
and you see there are some differences

781
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,359
the the the

782
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,119
between between those two uh conditions

783
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,558
but more importantly i think what i'm

784
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,319
trying to show you here is that about

785
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,319
approximately 10 of the heat that we

786
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,639
were able to supply in this floor

787
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,519
heating system would end up in the soil

788
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,278
underneath the remaining 90 of the heat

789
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,278
would actually end up in the

790
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,798
in the greenhouse environment and so

791
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,440
based upon that

792
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,679
fact we can now start looking at

793
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
recommending to growers to install an

794
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
insulating layer underneath the floor to

795
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,879
try to prevent that of course when the

796
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,880
floor is or the ground underneath the

797
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,320
floor is relatively dry

798
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,440
dry soil is not a very good heat

799
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,119
conductor

800
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,840
you may not need the insulation but if

801
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,798
you have a wet soil where particularly

802
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,319
if the soil moisture is a movement

803
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,879
continuously

804
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,879
you can significantly lose heat

805
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,720
from underneath the floor and therefore

806
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
in those cases a layer of insulation

807
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,319
might be very

808
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,359
desirable

809
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,119
and then the next step we took is

810
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,599
i showed you the diagram of the the

811
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,239
simulated slab we simulated a layer of

812
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,480
soil on that slab simulating

813
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,640
plug production and we looked at the

814
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,480
temperature distribution

815
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,960
in that layer of soil that simulated

816
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,798
layer of soil at different heights so

817
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,558
you see the temperature scale on the

818
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,200
left hand side

819
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,440
and so the bottom

820
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,679
green lines represent the highest

821
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,679
location in the two-inch layer of soil

822
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,399
that is sitting directly on the floor

823
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,640
and the the blue lines the top lines

824
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,439
represent the location closest to the

825
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,278
floor

826
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,798
and you can see here for the two

827
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,480
different designs where you have the 12

828
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,480
inch spacings with a little bit bigger

829
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,558
pipe or a little bit smaller pipe at the

830
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,319
shorter spacing of nine inches

831
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,319
represented by the rs and the s the

832
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,439
return on the supply lines in the bottom

833
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,240
of the graph

834
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,360
you can see here that the peaks

835
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,278
represe

836
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,038
coincide with where the supply lines are

837
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
installed and the valleys

838
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,398
are represented with where the return

839
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
lines are installed so that that all

840
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,319
matches up but what is more important i

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,759
think is to look at the fluctuation so

842
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,960
even though we have a very uniform

843
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,119
heating system

844
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,640
with the the simulation model we can now

845
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,798
start calculating exactly what the

846
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,759
temperature would be in our simulated

847
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,798
soil

848
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,960
layer and we could from that could could

849
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,798
make some assessment of whether these

850
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,640
fluctuating temperatures will have an

851
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:01,278
impact on on plant production

852
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,880
another project i'm involved with is a

853
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,640
micro turbine project and a micro

854
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,039
turbine is nothing more than a jet

855
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,880
engine in a box it's a stationary jet

856
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,200
engine

857
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,440
and it works on the same principle

858
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,798
we provide it with gas

859
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,000
and

860
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,000
it combusts the gas and as a result

861
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,480
it drives a turbine that generates

862
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,038
electricity we can use the electricity

863
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,200
on site we can export the electricity to

864
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,398
the grid or we can do a combination of

865
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,720
the two

866
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,278
so we're using landfill gas

867
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,319
landfill gas was initially

868
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,919
just

869
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,678
let go as the landfill is closed and and

870
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,600
bacteria break down

871
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,440
the refuge

872
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,359
methane gas is produced

873
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
that methane gas initially was just let

874
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,719
go to the environment but we quickly

875
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
realized that

876
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,558
that contributed significantly to

877
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,000
greenhouse gases and now nationwide we

878
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,440
have legislation that you can't do that

879
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,038
anymore you have to burn the gas

880
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,759
at least that's what's been done up

881
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,759
until now mostly most recently that's

882
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,119
that means they flared it

883
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,278
but of course then you waste it you

884
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,359
convert it to a still a greenhouse gas

885
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,919
co2 which is less of a greenhouse gas

886
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,678
than methane gas less potent

887
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,759
um so from that point of view it's good

888
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,320
but of course you waste that energy and

889
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:21,119
so we tapped into that resource

890
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,720
and and designed designed this this

891
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,639
micro turbine system

892
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
the challenge is if you use landfill gas

893
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,799
it's not as clean as natural gas

894
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
and so you need to clean it up

895
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,720
in order not to do damage to the

896
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,399
some of the critical components of the

897
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,240
of the turbine system

898
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,239
and so we need to remove sulfur gas and

899
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
you see two large cylinders here that

900
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,640
contain a

901
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,720
proprietary material

902
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,840
that probably contains a lot of iron

903
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,360
filings that is able to strip out

904
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,678
passively the sulfur gas the sulfur

905
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,519
and and then we go through a a

906
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,480
compression cycle and a refrigeration

907
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,879
cycle

908
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,720
to collect the moisture in the gas but

909
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
also more importantly the siloxane

910
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,679
chemicals a group of chemicals based on

911
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
silicate

912
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
that is it can be very detrimental to

913
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,240
engine components so we

914
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,599
we collect those we take them out

915
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,759
and then the remainder of the gas is

916
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,079
clean enough to be combusted in the

917
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,519
micro turbine system

918
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,558
you can see here it was a relatively

919
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,880
expensive

920
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,759
undertaking about a three quarters of a

921
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
million dollar unit

922
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,720
but it generates a fair amount of

923
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,079
electricity

924
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,839
that we can use for the supplemental

925
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,918
lighting system in the greenhouse

926
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,000
and if we we don't need that we can

927
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,919
export it to the grid and get a fairly

928
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,319
decent price for for the electricity

929
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,320
that way

930
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,919
it is commissioned as i show here in

931
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,120
2008 and we have some long-term data

932
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,799
operating it now

933
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,558
i can't take any credit for that but

934
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,000
because i started talking about energy i

935
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:53,519
wanted to show you that we have some

936
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,880
progressive growers in the state of new

937
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,480
jersey as well as we have in new york

938
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
this grower

939
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,798
was using

940
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,240
oil fuel oil as a as a fuel source for

941
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,679
his greenhouse operation that's about

942
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,519
seven acres

943
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,519
and um

944
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,839
because of the increases in oil prices

945
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,278
he is not no longer able to

946
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,759
economically

947
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,159
use that fuel source to to run his

948
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,000
operation so he switched over

949
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,760
to biomass energy

950
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,798
and he wants to eventually get to a

951
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,798
point where he's using

952
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
miscanthus or or switchgrass as the

953
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,159
biomass feedstock for for his operation

954
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,079
so he has 200 acres on site that he he's

955
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
planning to convert to

956
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,678
miscanthus and and

957
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,919
switchgrass

958
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,440
in the meantime he's using wood pellets

959
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,799
and so you can see here what porch

960
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,038
pellet looks like and you see the truck

961
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,440
delivering the wood pallas to two large

962
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,240
silos and then from the silos that get

963
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,360
organ gets ordered into a boiler system

964
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,519
that he uses to to run his operation

965
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,119
so we see a lot of growers struggling

966
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,759
with the energy

967
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,879
issue and and here's an example of how a

968
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,240
progressive grower was able to

969
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,919
convert

970
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,278
from from fuel oil to to biomass oil the

971
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,600
only challenge is and he's still

972
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:17,119
fighting this a little bit is that

973
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:19,199
because of his he's combusting biomass

974
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,678
he now has to deal with new air

975
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,080
regulations from our state dep

976
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,759
air quality issue is is important in new

977
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,839
jersey we have

978
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,480
we have issues with that and so our dep

979
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,798
is very strict about that so the

980
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,720
permitting issues associated with the

981
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,158
conversion from his oil system to this

982
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,519
biomass system

983
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,880
although realistically there are not

984
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,159
that many more

985
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,919
um

986
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,000
contributing components that he is

987
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
releasing into the environment just a

988
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,919
permitting issue because he has a

989
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,200
biomass type combustion system has been

990
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,960
have been very

991
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,399
challenging for him

992
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,640
aj are those mainly particulates or yep

993
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,639
yep

994
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,558
we also started to dabble a little bit

995
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,558
in led lighting i got a little seed

996
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,639
grant from the college

997
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,440
and as you can see here in a very

998
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,919
simplistic way we had a very little

999
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,679
money in that seat funding

1000
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,480
we purchased a bunch of off-the-shelf

1001
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,800
screw-in type led bulbs and

1002
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,240
started to grow some tomato plants

1003
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,679
and you can see here as the tomato

1004
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,598
plants are getting taller and getting

1005
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,760
close to the lamps you see certain areas

1006
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,240
that are clearly red and clearly blue

1007
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,000
the two colors that are typically used

1008
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,678
to try to improve

1009
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
plant growth and development

1010
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,559
and

1011
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,000
obviously this is not an ideal situation

1012
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,279
but there's an interesting side note and

1013
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
maybe this means something maybe it

1014
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,839
doesn't

1015
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
the two

1016
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,358
tomatoes that you see here one growing

1017
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,519
mostly under blue light and the other

1018
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,199
one growing mostly on the red light were

1019
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,039
not different from each other the

1020
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,039
quality aspects and the and the

1021
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,639
production aspects were no different

1022
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,480
they were obviously on the same plant

1023
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,919
but they were getting for significant

1024
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,559
amount of time

1025
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,480
significantly different color light

1026
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,078
provided to them

1027
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,039
and then before i move on i should say

1028
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
that

1029
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,800
i i'm participating now in a much larger

1030
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,280
effort looking at led systems for

1031
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,200
for greenhouse production

1032
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,599
with a group of people from different

1033
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,679
universities carrie mitchell at purdue

1034
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,039
and others at purdue eric runkle and

1035
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,199
michigan state

1036
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,599
the group of gene giacomelli and cherry

1037
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,759
kubota at arizona

1038
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,000
and and myself at rutgers we are we're

1039
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
trying to look at

1040
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
a comprehensive study both from the

1041
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,800
plant aspect as from the engineering

1042
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,039
aspect on what we need in terms of led

1043
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,519
lighting systems for for the greenhouse

1044
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,519
industry

1045
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,000
and i also was involved

1046
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,239
for many years now with an international

1047
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
committee that looked at guidelines for

1048
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,639
controlled environments if you work in

1049
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,880
controlled environments you realize that

1050
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,879
when you when you read the literature

1051
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,039
people not always report all the

1052
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
critical

1053
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,159
environmental parameters that they need

1054
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,000
to report in order for you to understand

1055
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,319
at least get a detailed understanding of

1056
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,079
the experiments and also

1057
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,320
for you to be able to replicate that

1058
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,880
experiment so we have for many years

1059
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,640
with an international group looked at

1060
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,039
developing guidelines here you see the

1061
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,440
example for experiments in growth rooms

1062
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
and growth chambers

1063
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,559
we have developed several of these

1064
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,000
guidelines now for growth rooms and

1065
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,559
growth chambers as well as for tissue

1066
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,719
culture facilities and we're working on

1067
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,799
a guideline for

1068
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,319
for greenhouse production as well

1069
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
and what we are really

1070
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,000
trying to get after is to have a a table

1071
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,358
like this

1072
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,719
where researchers can look at the

1073
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,559
different parameters that are important

1074
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,078
for plant production which you see on

1075
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,000
the left hand side here

1076
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,760
they understand what units they need to

1077
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,800
use to measure those parameters

1078
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,520
correctly

1079
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,320
where to measure those conditions

1080
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,960
when to measure them and what to report

1081
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,559
not only in their reports to funding

1082
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,159
agency but perhaps more importantly in

1083
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,799
their reports to the scientific

1084
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,039
community through papers and

1085
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,480
presentations so this is an ongoing

1086
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,679
effort and although it's a fairly

1087
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,760
thankless effort i think it's an

1088
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,118
important effort because hopefully

1089
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,680
it will bring the entire research

1090
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,680
community

1091
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,759
more in line with each other so that we

1092
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,320
can better understand and use each other

1093
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,079
results

1094
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,280
then moving on to my sabbatic in the

1095
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,800
netherlands and here you see a pretty

1096
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,720
picture of

1097
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
one of their greenhouse facilities that

1098
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,358
is growing roses

1099
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,719
i think

1100
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,400
if you want to see rose production in

1101
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,480
the netherlands you should be quick

1102
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,160
because i think just like in the united

1103
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,039
states

1104
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,159
the costs are prohibitive uh and are

1105
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,239
getting it's getting more and more

1106
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,480
difficult for growers to continue this

1107
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,959
this type of business and so i wouldn't

1108
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,960
be surprised in the next 10 to 20 years

1109
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,480
the entire rose production would

1110
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:54,000
disappear from the netherlands

1111
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,920
i i uh worked with uh my old department

1112
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,760
the yagas junior department called now

1113
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
the farm technology group which has

1114
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,560
become part of the plant sciences group

1115
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,480
and for those of you who

1116
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,400
know a little bit about the netherlands

1117
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,159
the way their system is set up is quite

1118
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,160
differently than we have

1119
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,159
our system here and in the united states

1120
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,759
and so i wanted to take a few minutes to

1121
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,759
explain a little bit

1122
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,440
how the system operates and how it's put

1123
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,839
together the plan sciences group

1124
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,119
consists of the university wageningen

1125
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,559
university and research center wrur

1126
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,559
and then the plant sciences group in

1127
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,400
particular there's also a group called

1128
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,320
the plant research international and the

1129
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,440
applied plant research group or ppo

1130
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,838
so all these entities the university

1131
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,599
the the former extension

1132
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,838
government research facilities are all

1133
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,119
combined in a sort of convoluted

1134
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,519
organization

1135
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,599
called the plant sciences group

1136
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,480
you see the locations the main locations

1137
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,039
as well as their field trial stations

1138
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,119
and i wanted to give you some sense of

1139
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,199
the the value of the horticulture

1140
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,960
industry in the netherlands and

1141
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,639
particularly for bill miller i added

1142
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,159
bulbs as well hopefully my numbers are

1143
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:09,199
correct but here you see uh the the

1144
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:12,159
monetary value of the exports both to

1145
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,319
the world and as a subset of that within

1146
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,118
the european union

1147
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,039
the export the the dollar the the in

1148
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,519
this case the euro amounts

1149
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,440
uh associated with these exports and i

1150
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,599
for reference i give you the

1151
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,960
uh the gross domestic products of the

1152
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,200
netherlands

1153
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,519
it's a the contribution that

1154
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:34,159
horticulture is making to the country is

1155
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,320
very significant and hence perhaps the

1156
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,920
the the uh

1157
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,119
the top position that that the

1158
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,838
netherlands

1159
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,838
maintains up until today in this field

1160
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,800
they have very nice new facilities the

1161
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,799
the organization in wageningen has also

1162
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,880
completely changed they are building an

1163
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,200
entirely new campus and the plant

1164
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,519
sciences group as you can see here has a

1165
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,759
very wonderful new facility with large

1166
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,960
greenhouse operations as well

1167
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,960
so they really put a lot of effort into

1168
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,838
getting people up to speed and having

1169
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,199
the world-class facility there

1170
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,279
and then if you really wanted to know

1171
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,480
more about the specifics this is

1172
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,800
something i got out of a canned

1173
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,159
presentation by the plant sciences group

1174
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,079
they have four

1175
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,519
specific focus areas sustainable

1176
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,160
production and climate change

1177
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,159
plant-based materials health and systems

1178
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,879
biology and you can read off under each

1179
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:29,199
of these four areas the specific areas

1180
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,880
that they target at these are the main

1181
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,559
areas that they try to focus their

1182
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,358
research on so they are they're not

1183
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,960
doing

1184
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,440
everything anymore for everybody they

1185
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,960
have specifically targeted areas where

1186
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,599
they feel they can make a significant

1187
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,599
contribution

1188
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,440
unlike in the united states in the

1189
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,358
netherlands

1190
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,760
they have a wonderful statistical

1191
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,039
service that collects many many data

1192
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
points not only for the greenhouse

1193
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,960
industry but for many industries

1194
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,480
and so there's a wealth of data

1195
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,838
available there about what the

1196
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
greenhouse

1197
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,119
industry is doing and i wanted to show

1198
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,358
you

1199
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,440
several sets of slides

1200
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,559
indicating what the trends are

1201
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,720
because i think there are some very

1202
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,318
interesting trends going on and in very

1203
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,559
recent years so you're looking here at

1204
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,519
three different years in 2000 2005 and

1205
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,480
2009 that was the last year i found data

1206
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,159
four

1207
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,318
and you can by the way you can get this

1208
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,279
annual updated data yourself you have to

1209
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,838
pay about 150 euros or so to get a nice

1210
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
book that contains many very interesting

1211
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,599
facts about the industry

1212
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,440
so if you need this kind of data i can i

1213
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,200
can point you in the right direction

1214
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,639
but what you're looking at here is the

1215
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,480
the number of operations and the

1216
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,400
particular size of these operations and

1217
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,800
if you look at the data carefully then

1218
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,358
you see that all sizes are declining

1219
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,160
rapidly except for the very largest size

1220
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,559
so what you're seeing here is that the

1221
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,598
number of greenhouse operations is

1222
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,920
declining overall but we see

1223
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,079
more of the remaining greenhouses become

1224
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,079
larger and larger and this is a very

1225
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,760
recent development it used to be that

1226
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,039
the average size was around a hectare in

1227
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,319
the netherlands and it was that for a

1228
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,079
long time

1229
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,159
but now in the last 10 years or so you

1230
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,680
see you see a significant change in that

1231
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,358
so we get fewer companies but the

1232
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,358
companies that are remaining are larger

1233
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,159
and then i also separated out on the

1234
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,559
bottom here comparing the vegetable

1235
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:25,118
versus the others because the vegetables

1236
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,119
obviously are of interest to myself so

1237
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,960
we see the same trend in the vegetable

1238
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,880
production the number of vegetable

1239
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,519
operations is significantly declining

1240
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,680
over the last 10 years but the the size

1241
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,119
of the individual operations is is

1242
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,039
increasing and increasing quite

1243
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,800
substantially

1244
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,559
if you look at the overall production

1245
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,240
area in the netherlands that has

1246
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,599
remained the same around 10 000 hectares

1247
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,159
but again you see some interesting

1248
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,519
changes in the the first set of

1249
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,318
bars you see that the vegetable

1250
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,318
production is significantly increases

1251
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,800
so is so is there an increase in

1252
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:59,920
flowering pot plants but you see the cut

1253
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,000
flowers

1254
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,519
is significantly declining and hence my

1255
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,159
comment earlier about the rose

1256
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,318
production i think it becomes it is

1257
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,239
becoming too expensive

1258
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,039
to grow cut flowers in the netherlands

1259
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,318
and and so this is this is why i think

1260
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,318
you won't see

1261
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,639
very many rose growers in the next 10 to

1262
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,239
20 years anymore

1263
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,318
if you look at the

1264
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,799
vegetable production you see a similar

1265
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,480
trend although here we see an increase

1266
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
particularly because of tomato increase

1267
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,880
in pepper increase

1268
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,720
and strawberries is mentioned here also

1269
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,119
obviously strawberry is not considered a

1270
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,118
vegetable but for the dutch industry

1271
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,200
it's the it's one of the few

1272
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,119
fruits that are grown in greenhouses so

1273
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,039
for convenience they're typically

1274
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,079
grouped in with vegetable production so

1275
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,880
you see

1276
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,318
some of the vegetables are increasing

1277
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,318
others others not so much

1278
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,280
when you look at the cut flower and the

1279
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,960
pop plant area we see again roses

1280
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,000
declining chrysanthemums declining and

1281
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,920
other crops declining

1282
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,480
so overall the cut flowers are declining

1283
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,400
but the pot embedding plants are are

1284
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,159
keeping steady or perhaps slightly

1285
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,200
increasing so again it's it's an

1286
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,759
interesting trend that is occurring

1287
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,039
comparing holland to one of the other eu

1288
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,920
countries where lots of greenhouse

1289
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,519
production is going on in the spain

1290
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
you see here that the production in

1291
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,318
spain in terms of area really dwarfs

1292
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,480
what's going on in the netherlands

1293
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,920
so keep that in mind and keep in mind

1294
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,159
i'm talking about vegetable production

1295
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,559
here

1296
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,159
one of the reasons is that of course if

1297
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,199
you look at a particular reason the

1298
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,598
almeria region in spain we see a very

1299
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,838
significant increase in the in the last

1300
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,680
40 years or so in greenhouse production

1301
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:47,039
area in that particular location this is

1302
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:50,000
the the main factor why why spain is so

1303
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,639
much so much more of a bigger producer

1304
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,039
compared to the netherlands and we see

1305
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,879
we see

1306
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,759
and as a result of course we see a shift

1307
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,000
in

1308
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,319
in focus when you look at the european

1309
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,519
union in terms of where where fruits and

1310
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,279
vegetables are produced

1311
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,880
auction prices are always interesting to

1312
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,480
look at and what i really want you to

1313
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,079
take home from this slide is when you're

1314
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,000
looking at two different years and

1315
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,240
several types of tomatoes round tomatoes

1316
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,639
cherry tomatoes and on the vine tomatoes

1317
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,559
but the the challenge here as we would

1318
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,400
have in the united states is that you

1319
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,679
see significant fluctuations from year

1320
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,039
to year and you see significant

1321
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,118
fluctuations

1322
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,719
uh from season to season so

1323
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,280
what we always hoped for with our

1324
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,199
lettuce system is that because we could

1325
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,640
deliver consistently

1326
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,799
there would be a consistent price

1327
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,318
associated with that consistent delivery

1328
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,640
that is not happening in the netherlands

1329
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,159
and it's not going to happen anytime

1330
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,879
soon in the netherlands either i think

1331
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,039
so

1332
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,119
growers are forced to

1333
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,920
deal with this situation as a result it

1334
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,240
continues to be a very challenging

1335
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,838
production system because some years you

1336
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,759
get a good price in some years you get a

1337
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,039
bad price and how do you deal with that

1338
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,040
from an economic point of view

1339
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,358
we see a lot of growers

1340
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,480
using combined heat and power systems in

1341
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,318
the netherlands

1342
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,119
and that was historically because gas

1343
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,960
prices were relatively inexpensive

1344
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
and so it made sense because they used

1345
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,838
lots of supplemental lighting and used

1346
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,079
more and more of it

1347
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,559
in the last decade or so

1348
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,800
these are expensive systems

1349
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,920
but they were economical at the time

1350
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,680
in fact in 2010 about 12 percent of the

1351
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,280
national electricity consumption was

1352
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,159
produced by greenhouses well think about

1353
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,680
that that is really a significant

1354
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,679
contribution from these

1355
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,759
individual systems installed at

1356
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
greenhouse operations

1357
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,079
more recently we see that the gas prices

1358
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,719
have increased because they are more

1359
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,359
tied to oil prices in in europe than

1360
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,358
they are here and we see lots of growers

1361
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,000
getting in trouble because this system

1362
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,000
is no longer as profitable as it used to

1363
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,318
be so they have these expensive systems

1364
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,760
installed they have multi-year

1365
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,440
projections for how they're going to pay

1366
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,920
them back and all of a sudden

1367
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,760
the situation changes the gas prices is

1368
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,760
more expensive than i anticipated

1369
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,760
electricity prices have not gone up as

1370
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,960
high as they had hoped and as a result

1371
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,280
they get into trouble

1372
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,159
keeping with the theme of of lighting

1373
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,240
we

1374
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,920
and i've i've looked at lighting systems

1375
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:18,959
in the netherlands and this is the the

1376
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,200
latest

1377
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,358
approach that they're taking into canopy

1378
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,199
lighting using led systems

1379
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,199
not only led lighting but still

1380
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,118
maintaining overhead high pressure

1381
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,558
sodium lighting to grow a crop

1382
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,640
whether this is the the ultimate

1383
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,400
approach i'm not so sure but at least

1384
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,039
this is the latest

1385
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,639
technology latest state of the art which

1386
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,000
they are trying out and and they're

1387
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,960
claiming they're getting good results

1388
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
although i haven't seen many published

1389
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,838
publications about this yet

1390
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,358
there was a food safety issue that i

1391
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:53,599
wanted to mention that happened just

1392
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:56,400
before we came um an e coli infestation

1393
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,039
and it had significant implications in

1394
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,639
in

1395
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,039
the on the industry

1396
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,358
it turned out to be a fenugreek seed

1397
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:06,239
that was imported from from egypt that

1398
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,639
was grown on organic farm in germany but

1399
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,118
it took several weeks to discover

1400
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,519
the cause of of the infestation and as a

1401
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,680
result what they needed to do about and

1402
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,920
in the meantime many other crops were

1403
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,279
implicated as the source for this food

1404
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,119
contamination

1405
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,200
and as a result

1406
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,318
the entire production came to a grinding

1407
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,759
halt

1408
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,719
lots of fruits and vegetables had to be

1409
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,960
discarded and as a result many growers

1410
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,480
got into severe financial

1411
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,880
difficulty and in fact we see a

1412
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,559
large number of greenhouse operations

1413
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,200
that had to shut down

1414
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,359
and close completely as a result of this

1415
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,039
food scare so this is just a

1416
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,400
precaution we've had these food scares

1417
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,400
in the united states as well not

1418
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,400
typically for greenhouse operations but

1419
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,920
more for field production but this is an

1420
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,000
example on how

1421
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,519
a completely unrelated event it had

1422
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,719
nothing to do with greenhouse production

1423
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,639
nothing to do with crops that we

1424
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,959
typically grow in greenhouses

1425
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,199
had a significant impact on the industry

1426
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,760
to the point where we see growers going

1427
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,759
out of business

1428
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,400
then moving on to some future directions

1429
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,000
and i put in this picture because i

1430
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
think we should always be moving forward

1431
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,119
but before i get into my suggestions i i

1432
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,720
i think we have to go back and look at

1433
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,240
what's going on and so i like to show

1434
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,759
this slide

1435
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,118
looking at population growth that you

1436
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,359
should well be familiar to all of you

1437
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,119
when professor langhans was born around

1438
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,759
the time we had 2 billion people living

1439
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,680
on this planet by now we have 7 billion

1440
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,400
and in the next

1441
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,799
almost 40 years or so by 2050 we will

1442
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,200
have 9 billion people

1443
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,960
i was born in 1960 so there was a

1444
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,159
already a billion increase compared to

1445
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,760
when professor langhans was born

1446
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,960
so this is something this is reality

1447
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,319
this is not going to change and this is

1448
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,159
something we have to deal with and when

1449
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,599
i was in the netherlands i

1450
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,199
i picked up on an

1451
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,440
inaugural address that's what they do in

1452
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,000
the netherlands when a new professor

1453
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,838
is installed in his position they give a

1454
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
speech and he gave a speech

1455
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,599
talk about this issue

1456
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,680
and he mentioned that if if by 2050 we

1457
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,200
want everybody the 9 billion people that

1458
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,598
will be living on earth and we want

1459
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,838
everybody to eat

1460
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,599
using european standards this is

1461
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,599
probably not going to happen but use it

1462
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,680
as a reference point

1463
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,720
so have the access to food and the

1464
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,078
quality

1465
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,118
of the food that europeans are

1466
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,440
accustomed to we need to triple our

1467
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,760
production

1468
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,000
that is a that is a tall order

1469
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,720
now as i said we may not we may not get

1470
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,239
to european levels but that we have to

1471
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,318
increase production

1472
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,039
should be evident and so this is reality

1473
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,318
this is something we have to deal with

1474
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,960
the other thing we have to deal with is

1475
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,920
that we're not creating more land we

1476
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,000
have limited amount of area available to

1477
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,400
grow our crops at and if you look at the

1478
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
different regions of the world here and

1479
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,800
you look at particularly the croplands

1480
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,159
or the

1481
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,039
brownish

1482
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,239
orange

1483
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,920
like

1484
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,479
bar here

1485
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,519
you see that we have very limited

1486
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,039
areas set aside for crop production

1487
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,239
in fact i think

1488
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,199
on a world

1489
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,000
scale

1490
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,480
it's perhaps 0.2 hectares

1491
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,800
per person that is available for crop

1492
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,400
production and if we add more people of

1493
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,559
course that number becomes even smaller

1494
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,559
and smaller and smaller so land

1495
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,239
becomes a critical issue as well and

1496
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,920
obviously

1497
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,118
water is a very critical issue one

1498
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,079
percent of the earth's water is

1499
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,400
available

1500
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,680
as fresh water readily available as

1501
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,960
fresh water

1502
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,639
a lot of that

1503
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,880
by far the biggest part of it is

1504
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,799
consumed by agriculture we can do a lot

1505
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,240
better in certain

1506
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,960
irrigation systems in terms of

1507
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,279
efficiency but as of now a lot of that

1508
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,358
water that we have available is used for

1509
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,599
agriculture

1510
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,358
greenhouses of course

1511
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,039
allow for better control of water uptake

1512
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,318
but nevertheless if you look at our

1513
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,079
lettuce data

1514
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,639
it requires two and a half liters of

1515
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,720
water to grow one five ounce head of

1516
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,318
lettuce so that's a significant amount

1517
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,838
of water that we need

1518
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:12,079
to grow as simple plant as lettuce

1519
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,000
so the fact remains that we need large

1520
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,839
quantities of water

1521
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,800
to grow our crops whether we do it in a

1522
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,558
greenhouse or not

1523
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,318
greenhouse production comes a long way

1524
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,680
again around the time that professor

1525
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,440
langhans was born we we saw a lot of

1526
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,960
cold frames

1527
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,960
obviously that required a lot of labor

1528
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,039
you see a large crew there working

1529
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,240
in the netherlands we had

1530
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,719
greenhouses specifically designed for

1531
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,399
seed grapes so for for consumption

1532
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,159
grapes

1533
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,079
and you see also

1534
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,358
some older greenhouses on the left hand

1535
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,480
side for carnations and on the

1536
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:52,799
right-hand side for tomato production

1537
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,800
in a traditional old-fashioned system

1538
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,119
when professor langhans came to cornell

1539
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,640
in the early 50s

1540
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,920
cornell looked something like this you

1541
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,920
could still park your car in front of

1542
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,119
willett straight and there was a parking

1543
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,119
lot on the egg quad

1544
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,079
by the way

1545
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,519
ken poster was still working at the time

1546
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,519
he see a picture of ken post

1547
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,960
from 1951 so a year before professor

1548
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,440
langhas came

1549
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,119
came here and you see this the state of

1550
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,119
the greenhouse

1551
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,119
i have to add to that when i came in the

1552
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,200
in the late 80s the greenhouse didn't

1553
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,119
look much different

1554
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,199
obviously

1555
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,280
some of them some of them obviously some

1556
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,318
of them have improved so talking about

1557
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,400
parking

1558
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,279
if you live in a in a densely populated

1559
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,880
area

1560
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,880
then you're dealing with this issue so

1561
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
this is another example of the increase

1562
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,599
in population growth and the challenges

1563
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,558
that we are are facing uh we are faced

1564
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,559
with

1565
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,200
dealing with that increase

1566
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,640
going back to the greenhouses we see

1567
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,199
lots of

1568
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,759
uh developments lots of technology that

1569
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,000
that is in use today that really make

1570
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,520
these very highly sophisticated and

1571
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,280
high-tech systems

1572
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,719
so just to name some examples you see

1573
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,839
the greenhouse on the upper left-hand

1574
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,598
side

1575
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,119
a design that doesn't use any gutters

1576
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
anymore the greenhouse is designed so

1577
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,119
that the glass panes the very large

1578
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,400
glass panes actually form or gutter

1579
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,720
themselves

1580
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,400
and the trusses are not running

1581
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,838
across the base but are running in the

1582
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,000
length of the bay actually supporting

1583
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,759
the area where normally the gutter would

1584
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,559
be and the trusses is the truss is

1585
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,319
designed in such a way that it provides

1586
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,440
a space for the energy current to be

1587
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:29,279
stored in

1588
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,720
again to try to maximize light

1589
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,160
transmission through this system so

1590
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,118
there's a very

1591
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,279
uh

1592
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,960
specific design features that allow for

1593
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,280
maximum light transmission in this

1594
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,798
highly modern greenhouse we have

1595
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,599
sophisticated on the upper right hand

1596
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,119
side we have sophisticated

1597
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,880
irrigation systems here you see an

1598
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,798
entire table being moved by a

1599
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,798
computerized system to an irrigation

1600
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,639
station the funnel there

1601
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,480
would be supplied with the right amount

1602
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,118
of water and nutrients for the

1603
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,199
the gerbera crop to grow optimally in

1604
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,280
this in this system so the the computer

1605
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,960
decides when the crop needs irrigation

1606
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,559
and then moves the table to an

1607
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,880
irrigation station

1608
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,960
to provide it with water and nutrients

1609
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,760
we have very sophisticated robots we

1610
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,358
call them flat fixtures the the that's

1611
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,400
that that

1612
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:18,400
make sure that every cell in a plug tray

1613
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,039
is filled with a viable plant so there's

1614
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,559
a camera system that inspects an entire

1615
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,358
tray

1616
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,680
a mechanical system that takes out the

1617
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:30,318
tray the cells that were not germinated

1618
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,719
or have diseased plants and then refills

1619
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,400
those open spaces with

1620
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:37,118
with viable plants to make sure that

1621
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,760
when a grower sells a flat 100 of the

1622
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,680
plants in that flat are actually viable

1623
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,520
for the next stage of production and

1624
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,639
then ultimately on the lower right hand

1625
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,960
side we have high throughput greenhouses

1626
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:51,759
in which plants are grown in individual

1627
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,679
containers that are that are kept track

1628
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,640
of by a computer system so these plants

1629
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,639
can be manipulated individually

1630
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,199
in the greenhouse system for

1631
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,960
for measurements and and

1632
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,960
and handling so

1633
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,318
very expensive but highly

1634
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,798
uh computerized and and

1635
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,960
automated systems to to make sure we can

1636
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:16,798
handle plants very efficiently without

1637
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,679
uh much human interaction

1638
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,719
so

1639
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,639
to come to some conclusions um

1640
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,318
i think to help feed

1641
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,679
the growing world

1642
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,440
to me it seems greenhouse food

1643
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,480
production is a is going to be a

1644
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,240
critical component in that

1645
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,079
however i think

1646
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:35,838
despite the need and i think the

1647
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,920
demonstrated capabilities as i've tried

1648
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,279
to indicate in this talk

1649
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,798
there's there's

1650
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,119
limited funding

1651
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,318
and and also i think we have we we don't

1652
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,838
have the support from college

1653
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,639
administrators that itself could be an

1654
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,920
entire presentation uh but uh i think i

1655
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,598
think you understand what i'm talking

1656
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,599
about

1657
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,480
so what do we need to do i think i think

1658
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,400
as a group as a as a group of scientists

1659
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,240
working in controlled environments we

1660
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,838
need to become stronger advocates for

1661
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,639
greenhouse production i think we need to

1662
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,558
find a way to tell our story better and

1663
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,480
to tell it to people that really matter

1664
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,119
and that can then take action to help us

1665
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,639
with funding and help

1666
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,559
further the cause

1667
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:15,920
another area i think and i strongly

1668
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
believe in this and where we can make

1669
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,760
improvements is to to increase our

1670
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,079
collaborations

1671
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,079
locally regionally but also

1672
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,200
internationally

1673
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,880
and i think

1674
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:28,879
you may have heard a lot of discussion

1675
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,880
recently about vertical farming

1676
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,480
um i don't necessarily think vertical

1677
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,798
farming is a bad idea but i certainly

1678
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,719
don't think it's a great idea

1679
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:40,798
but i think we need to come up as a

1680
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:42,399
group with a viable alternative

1681
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,159
in addition and i get to back to

1682
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,960
vertical farming in a second in addition

1683
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,118
i think we need to look at our

1684
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,798
inputs and we need to look at the

1685
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,798
efficient use of our inputs we need to

1686
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:54,639
reduce energy consumption

1687
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,199
and waste we need to increase the

1688
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,719
biodegradable materials the use of them

1689
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,000
and we need more recycling in our

1690
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,078
industry

1691
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,639
we are working on those issues but i

1692
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,039
don't think we we we do enough of it yet

1693
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,960
because i think if we don't

1694
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,639
outsiders will do it for us and of

1695
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,519
course when outsiders start looking at

1696
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,039
us

1697
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,119
they may come up with different ideas

1698
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,239
and different outcomes and outcomes that

1699
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,920
may not be always in in the

1700
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,959
in to the benefit of the greenhouse

1701
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,720
industry

1702
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,559
so we need to look at things like life

1703
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,959
cycle assessments of our production

1704
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,798
systems we know we use a lot of energy

1705
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,960
we know significant resources

1706
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,559
particularly water

1707
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,079
and we need to look at the life cycle

1708
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,720
assessment of those

1709
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,400
production processes and include things

1710
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:42,000
like carbon footprints and other

1711
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,720
environmental impacts to come to a a

1712
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,400
transparent and fair assessment of what

1713
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,480
we're doing because i think

1714
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,639
if we don't do that others will

1715
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,960
and others may question why we are using

1716
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,440
significant resources for example

1717
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,838
to produce non-essentials and i think a

1718
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,358
a rose crop in the greenhouse

1719
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,358
or perhaps even a lettuce crop in the

1720
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:03,199
greenhouse could be labeled by outsiders

1721
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:05,279
as a non-essential crop

1722
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,879
and i think if that happens

1723
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,960
we're going to have a long way fighting

1724
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,838
ourselves back and trying to make sure

1725
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,679
that those those industries remain

1726
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,358
viable

1727
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,879
because i think if once we get into a

1728
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,719
negative consumer

1729
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,079
perception case

1730
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,439
and there are examples of that in our

1731
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,960
industry

1732
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,639
if we get to that point it's going to be

1733
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,880
very hard to

1734
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:29,440
to fight those perceptions and to

1735
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,280
to get back on top again

1736
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,200
so back to vertical farming

1737
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,559
i found this

1738
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,919
reference and

1739
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,440
some pictures

1740
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,400
i don't think vertical farming is a new

1741
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,960
idea here you see an idea by

1742
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,000
a professor in australia in austria i'm

1743
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,679
sorry

1744
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,079
from the early 60s

1745
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,440
looking at a conveyor system in a

1746
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,359
vertical tower

1747
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,838
trying to grow crops using supplemental

1748
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,598
lighting to help

1749
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,078
speed up production

1750
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,838
so i think the vertical farming is not a

1751
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,519
new

1752
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:03,519
idea here you see a modern version of

1753
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,480
what a vertical farm looked like in an

1754
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:09,358
urban area so the idea is you produce it

1755
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,280
close to to densely populated centers

1756
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,960
you produce it in

1757
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,720
a hydroponic system

1758
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,960
but minimizing really the the

1759
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,639
transportation distance

1760
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,960
between where you produce it and where

1761
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:25,118
it's consumed

1762
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,880
so is it a good idea

1763
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,640
you should ask professor albright to

1764
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,160
give a talk because he can give a very

1765
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:34,400
nice talk telling you that it's not a

1766
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:36,318
good idea i tend to agree with him

1767
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,480
but nevertheless it's an idea that's out

1768
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,318
there and it's being promoted

1769
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,920
by lots of people so i think we need to

1770
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:45,759
deal with it as i said i think we need

1771
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,358
to come up with a viable alternative to

1772
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,440
to counteract some of the forces that

1773
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:51,440
are trying to push push this further

1774
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,400
professor albright says that an

1775
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,679
alternative might be to to look at what

1776
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,680
he calls perry urban agriculture so

1777
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,399
still have food production close to

1778
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:06,159
large population centers but not

1779
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,079
grow them right inside the population

1780
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:08,879
center but we grow them at the perimeter

1781
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,440
so

1782
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,680
at the outside of the densely populated

1783
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,559
areas i think that's a good idea what i

1784
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,118
am

1785
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:20,000
proposing is in addition to that to also

1786
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,200
revisit the idea of having greenhouses

1787
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,318
attached to residential living spaces

1788
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:27,919
and not thinking about this as a as a an

1789
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,599
afterthought where a greenhouse is put

1790
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,240
in the backyard or a greenhouse is

1791
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,440
attached to a home like a sunroom but

1792
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,439
really

1793
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,119
looking at an integration of both the

1794
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,440
greenhouse system with the living

1795
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,720
environment so involve architects and

1796
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,318
designers

1797
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,000
involve plant scientists involve

1798
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,759
agriculture engineers that know

1799
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,760
something about greenhouses

1800
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,799
and sit around the table and develop a

1801
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,760
system

1802
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:53,280
that makes the takes benefit of the of

1803
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,359
the heat that's being generated by the

1804
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,319
greenhouse and use that in the building

1805
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:58,239
system

1806
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,079
but obviously also

1807
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,679
provide for an opportunity for the

1808
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,640
family or the residents of the the

1809
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,480
structure to grow a certain number of

1810
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,400
crops in that space

1811
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,639
to hopefully make them become less

1812
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,720
dependent on traditional supply chains

1813
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,719
and i only have to point to the recent

1814
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:15,759
disaster that we had in new jersey and

1815
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,078
new york

1816
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,960
with hurricane sandy

1817
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:23,440
to to come to the realization that it is

1818
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,599
important for most of us

1819
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,679
uh to realize how dependent we are on

1820
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,720
some of these traditional supply chains

1821
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,199
and the

1822
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,358
uh the shock that it creates when those

1823
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,879
supply chains disappear

1824
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,038
it was a major shock and it still is a

1825
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,480
major shock to our system in new jersey

1826
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,000
and it's going to take quite some time

1827
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,880
to overcome that i went to the grocery

1828
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,719
store on friday and the lights were all

1829
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,480
dimmed there was no fresh produce and

1830
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,480
this is almost two weeks after the event

1831
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,280
no fresh produce

1832
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,079
all the cooling cases were emptied there

1833
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,480
were no frozen products at all in the

1834
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,400
store it was it felt like a third world

1835
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,358
country that i walked into

1836
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,960
and so the disruption of an event like

1837
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:05,279
what we had and granted this is not

1838
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,599
happening too often but we know it can

1839
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,400
happen and we are we're faced with it i

1840
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,280
think

1841
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,240
that

1842
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,079
makes

1843
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,000
it all the more relevant and all the

1844
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,760
more critical that we look at

1845
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,798
alternative ways of providing ourselves

1846
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,880
with food and energy and other critical

1847
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,719
components

1848
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,318
so with that and with this picture that

1849
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,358
was

1850
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,838
made

1851
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:31,119
several years ago by van gogh that i

1852
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,639
think strengthens the theme that i

1853
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,880
wanted to point out to

1854
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,719
which is local and small agriculture

1855
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,720
perhaps we need to revisit that idea and

1856
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:41,279
how we can incorporate

1857
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,558
small agriculture back into our modern

1858
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,400
way of living

1859
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,200
i want to close and i want to point out

1860
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,599
that

1861
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,118
obviously i'm standing as i present to

1862
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,599
you here

1863
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,519
on on many tall

1864
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,280
and giant shoulders here

1865
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,038
so i want to

1866
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,960
express my gratitude for all the work

1867
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,960
that was done for people that came

1868
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,679
before me but also many colleagues that

1869
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,280
i've worked with both here and elsewhere

1870
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,279
through my journey so thank you very

1871
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,280
much

1872
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,199
aeroponics

1873
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:21,038
um

1874
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,399
the the only research i'm familiar with

1875
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,559
is the work that's being done in the

1876
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,880
university of arizona and i'm not too

1877
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,359
familiar with it um

1878
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,960
obviously uh

1879
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,038
disney world in

1880
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,400
florida has been promoting aeroponics

1881
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,240
for quite some time and have shown that

1882
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,079
it can be successful

1883
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,239
the challenge is that

1884
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,880
if if the system fails if the pump

1885
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,798
doesn't pump and doesn't irrigate uh the

1886
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,880
routes continuously

1887
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:49,358
uh you you have a very short amount of

1888
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,599
time in which you can react and respond

1889
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,759
and overcome that issue so

1890
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,599
in terms of having a system that can

1891
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,480
that can deal with hiccups which we

1892
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:01,039
always have in these complicated systems

1893
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,639
it's it's it's delicate and so i think

1894
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,119
for commercial operations we haven't

1895
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,480
seen many people go that route although

1896
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,039
we know that

1897
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,679
if the system operates properly they can

1898
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:14,240
be successful

1899
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,078
apple and lettuce

1900
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,519
let's look at pure at efficiency so i

1901
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,760
looked at the amount of light that was

1902
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,358
received by the crop and the dry metal

1903
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,000
production and that's how i compare the

1904
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,239
two so pure from an efficiency point of

1905
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,239
view

1906
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,798
but your apple trees yes

1907
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,200
yeah you have to go to the monteith

1908
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,879
reference to get the details

1909
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,598
correct yeah and so this works in the

1910
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,280
netherlands but it may not work here

1911
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,200
yeah so this is what i showed you what

1912
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,119
they were doing in the netherlands and

1913
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,199
and the reasons of course is that that

1914
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,880
scaling up for them makes sense they

1915
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,519
have to compete with imports from other

1916
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,280
european countries particularly and so

1917
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,239
in order to stay in business with this

1918
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,319
high tech expensive system

1919
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:02,959
they feel that our only way out is to to

1920
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,639
scale up to have more production area

1921
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,760
to become more efficient with that

1922
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,440
system

1923
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,680
but that may not work in our case for

1924
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,440
sure you're right

1925
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,679
no i agree with you the only thing i

1926
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,358
want to add is that i think we have to

1927
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,679
be careful when we use the word

1928
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,519
sustainable because it means different

1929
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,679
something different to different people

1930
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,119
and so the the

1931
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,440
the the

1932
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,400
root of it is is important and i agreed

1933
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,159
to

1934
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,838
but i think

1935
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,199
when i talk about sustainability it may

1936
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:33,119
mean something different than when you

1937
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,358
talk about sustainability and

1938
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,358
and

1939
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:39,679
if we if we want to make sure that

1940
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,440
people understand

1941
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,358
what sustainability is and from from

1942
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,119
what point we're looking at it and how

1943
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,199
we use it we need to have a common

1944
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,440
definition and i think the definition is

1945
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,399
being slowly watered down at the moment

1946
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,679
and so that the term is i think

1947
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,519
disputable i i agree with the concept

1948
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,558
and it's important that we look at that

1949
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,280
but the wording is is perhaps something

1950
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,280
we need to look at

1951
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:10,038
go ahead let's thank aj and get them

1952
