1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:06,270
University

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,939
they've they've mentioned that I've been

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:09,899
doing a lot of traveling my primary

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,638
responsibility for this year and

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,589
probably for the next two years is to be

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,669
training on our conservation planners

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,710
within the Natural Resources

9
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,019
Conservation Service they all have to be

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,760
certified for conservation planning and

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,289
one of the courses that are required is

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,529
the economics of conservation planning

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,060
so we teach the we've been teaching I've

14
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,230
got eight weeks of summer I've been

15
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,549
teaching it and we've got other

16
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,379
counterparts that are teaching as well

17
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,460
but we have to change we have to do

18
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,109
within five years 3,000 employees so

19
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,609
what I've done though for this

20
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,798
particular talk is taking some

21
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,978
principles that we teach our planners

22
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:46,588
and applied it to the soil health

23
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:47,698
concepts or for you guys and then I'm

24
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,469
going to winnow it down and actually

25
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:50,759
talk about soil health in New York and

26
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,948
some case studies that have been done

27
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,219
here in New York that I helped there was

28
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,599
a retired economist Flo Schwartz who has

29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,558
worked with them and one of the case

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,808
studies actually is Dave Magus farm and

31
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,338
so we'll um i'll handle is out at the

32
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,478
end so it doesn't kind of take you away

33
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,319
from my talk

34
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,579
down-arrow you said okay so I'm gonna

35
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,829
talk about a little bit about the

36
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:16,750
difference on soil health management

37
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,670
practices NRCS will now provide

38
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,399
technical and financial assistance for

39
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,570
our more practices rural health related

40
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:25,030
with these are kind of the core

41
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:27,449
practices that are used within NRCS

42
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,149
most of the contradiction tillage

43
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,820
rotation a cover cropping field borders

44
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:37,750
riparian buffers nutrient and integrated

45
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:39,849
pest management so how do economists

46
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,280
compare these different practices and

47
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,359
help to provide information to producers

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,340
so that they can make an informed

49
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:49,179
decision what would work for them in

50
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,950
their particular operation so what we do

51
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:53,649
is we buy things of course into the

52
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,200
benefits and cost and in the benefits

53
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,478
and our CS looks at things according to

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,299
what we call swap ax which is soil water

55
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,879
air plants animals and then we added

56
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,250
energy and then also a human

57
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,349
considerations so those are the type of

58
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,090
benefit categories that we look at when

59
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:12,250
we're comparing things and we do this

60
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,049
not only for our farm but we do this

61
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,900
when we're looking at policy analysis as

62
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,489
well it's consistent and the costs of

63
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,829
course are the consistent over the

64
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:25,480
beautiful economic cost of land labor

65
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:28,390
capital management English and in this

66
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,828
case but all farming on-farm benefits

67
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,939
will differ it just depends on the

68
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,680
viewpoint if you're looking from a

69
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,530
policy viewpoint you're looking at the

70
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,060
off farm benefits and for to be talking

71
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,409
to a producer about implementing

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,469
practices of course we're looking at

73
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:44,009
what is the impact of them so these are

74
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:47,079
some templates that we have developed I

75
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:49,649
believe Paul maybe can help me or maybe

76
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:52,739
some contributions here is around 130

77
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,319
practices or so that we don't have

78
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,259
standards and specifications for so a

79
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,530
counterpart of mine took those 130

80
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:04,419
practices templates and they basically

81
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,609
take the categories that I showed you

82
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,509
before and talked about for each of

83
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,100
these practices

84
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,489
what could the potential positive

85
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,799
effects and negative effects be for a

86
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,319
producer if they were to implement that

87
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,090
practice and that's helpful because when

88
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,589
a conservation planner goes on a farm

89
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,348
and they want to chocolate

90
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,759
laundry list to start with and there

91
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:27,818
might be some additional things that are

92
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,409
particularly on that farm but it's a

93
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,909
really good laundry list that you can go

94
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,068
through and say okay this doesn't apply

95
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:35,620
here but something else does and it

96
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:37,899
helps them categorize the benefits in

97
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,019
the costs so I gave an example here of

98
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,450
cover cropping we call those tea charts

99
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,340
by the way

100
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,560
okay so when you're looking at um

101
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,180
economics and what we teach our

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,068
conservation plan is we're really

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,719
looking at the change from before to

104
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,009
after we don't have to look at

105
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,989
everything we don't have to look at

106
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:58,469
enterprise budgets and all that unless

107
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,509
we're um really winnowing down to

108
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,310
something we're talking to our producers

109
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,259
we're just looking at the positive

110
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,739
effects and the negative effects of the

111
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,689
change before and after so of course the

112
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,879
positive effects from a partial budget

113
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,340
would be increased revenues or reduced

114
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,298
costs and the negative effects for the

115
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,590
increased cost or decreased revenue I'm

116
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,870
gonna try to help make up time um so

117
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,089
what we do is we take put those concepts

118
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,530
and then we go through mighty charts

119
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,929
which come up with the different

120
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:32,699
categories we should be looking at and

121
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,889
this we call level one which is just

122
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,719
descriptive so in this case we're

123
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,660
looking at the positive effects might be

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,610
um treatment here what they've done is

125
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,050
they've combined different practices

126
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,850
into what we call a system and the

127
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,009
system is looking at the whole system on

128
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,870
a field or on a farm or whatever it

129
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,490
would be could be just one practice or

130
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,410
it could be a combination of practices

131
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,990
so combination of practices is the

132
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,910
system so in this case we have a

133
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,250
conservation treat treatment they have

134
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,140
crop rotation residue management pest

135
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,300
management and nutrient management and

136
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,740
then we go through that I would talk

137
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,350
about the positive effects and the

138
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,550
negative effects of that and so in the

139
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,430
descriptive we're just talking about

140
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,079
yield increasing increasing if they're

141
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,418
getting a financial assistance payment

142
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,029
that would be an increased revenue on

143
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:23,389
down and then the negative effects would

144
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:25,589
be um you have to buy no-till drill or

145
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,050
you know pesum and increased pest

146
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,869
management those type of things

147
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,210
or in a short time period you may

148
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,350
actually lose production so we outline

149
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:40,649
all of that for a producer tried you

150
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,150
okay I jumped to a level three a level

151
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,679
two just real briefly as you start

152
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,000
putting numbers to them they don't have

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,199
to be consistent it might be like

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
savings tons of soil per acre or buying

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,469
a no-till drill at twenty thousand

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,149
dollars or something like that and then

157
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,810
what the third example does

158
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:02,109
it puts it in like terms so in this case

159
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,879
you prop rotation and there's a formula

160
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,580
that you can come up with determine what

161
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,040
the average cost per acre per year is I

162
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,889
won't put into detail but it can be done

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,569
um you can reduce the cost by decreasing

164
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:20,219
fertilizer reducing tillage passes

165
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:22,959
reducing fuel and labor there's other

166
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,450
positive effects um improve soil and

167
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,599
water quality and you may have some sort

168
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,039
of habitat improvement for wildlife and

169
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,629
then the negative affects what they do

170
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,650
is they take something like a purchased

171
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:39,009
milled thrill and we amortize it over a

172
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:40,810
time period and that when you do all

173
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,149
that then you can come up with $1 for

174
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,790
acre per year positive impacts and

175
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:50,209
negative impact so if you look

176
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,750
let me see here what the wrong button

177
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,680
didn't I

178
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,500
okay there you go down here that's the

179
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,990
sum of all the benefits on $60 per acre

180
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,389
per year in this example and then the

181
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,389
negative affects the total is $22 per

182
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,579
acre per year and so the net benefits

183
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,120
would be thirty-eight dollars per acre

184
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,120
three

185
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:17,158
so another thing that we do is we take

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,899
all this information and a lot of

187
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:21,120
producers might say well this all sounds

188
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,799
well and good but how does this really

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,069
work I'd like to talk to people or I'd

190
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,180
like to see some examples of real life

191
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:30,650
experiences so that's what we're doing

192
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,968
the case studies and the benefit is that

193
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,779
usually we use the partial budget

194
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,839
technique

195
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:40,019
it does give real-world examples we work

196
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:42,929
with the producers to develop them um a

197
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,359
good case study is not just a shining

198
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,468
example it also shows the hardships that

199
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,150
they've gone through to get to where

200
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,769
they are and that's really important

201
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,388
because we don't want to paint a rosy

202
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,519
picture all the time but they're gonna

203
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,870
have trials and trips when they do when

204
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,978
they change what they're doing um but

205
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,459
you want to make sure that it's

206
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:04,500
relatable so whoever your your audience

207
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,680
is so you pick a producer that's either

208
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,649
is respected or it relates they've got

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,110
very similar circumstances to the

210
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:16,948
audience that you're trying to provide

211
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,270
this basically for and um one thing I

212
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,889
want to say is when you look at these

213
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,019
case studies and there's a lot of them

214
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,538
out there you want to look read it with

215
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,668
a critical eye because different people

216
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,110
have different agendas and there's some

217
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:29,698
times when they say all this looks

218
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,129
really really good you've really got to

219
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,310
get into the numbers to see if it's if

220
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:37,229
they're accurate or not sometimes they

221
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,778
inflate benefits or they decrease costs

222
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,759
and things like that so make sure that

223
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,288
when you're looking at things that

224
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,169
you're really reading it with a critical

225
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:50,309
eye and ask no questions

226
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:51,839
okay okay so I'm going to the two

227
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,599
examples that I'm going to hand out to

228
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,259
people if you're interested or angel

229
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Rose dairy and in this case they did um

230
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,299
both of these are in central New York

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,549
around Ontario northern Watertown area I

232
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:10,279
believe what is in social New York

233
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,279
somewhere right yeah

234
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,480
okay and that's the angel Rose dairy

235
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,649
what they have been doing no-till and

236
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,310
cover crop and then 350 acres and the

237
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,779
total net benefits um it's over eight

238
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,239
thousand dollars or twenty four dollars

239
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,159
per acre per year and that you can read

240
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,090
more details about this I'll hand it out

241
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,259
in these paste on the pronounce the

242
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,210
other thing I want to say about the case

243
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,490
studies is we try to make them two pages

244
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,200
to hand out they're meant to go to field

245
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,129
days and things like that so that people

246
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,210
can very quickly fitmom look at it and

247
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,590
it's not a whole bunch of papers they

248
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,060
don't have to delve into a lot of

249
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,570
research or whatever they can cut to the

250
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,889
chase right away um it's fine now it

251
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,690
wasn't interesting that you're up to

252
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:58,169
eight eight hundred cows now I think

253
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,340
ours was uh six six seventy or somewhere

254
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:01,769
around there and we did the case study

255
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,350
so it's great that you're able to

256
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:08,220
increase production on your farm um but

257
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,290
anyway uh if there was to 2,200 acres at

258
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,800
that point which was two years ago I

259
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:16,139
believe had told them that benefits of

260
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,919
over seventy eight thousand dollars for

261
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,980
sixty two dollars per acre per year

262
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,979
you

263
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:25,448
so some things to remember when you're

264
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,928
doing partial budgeting or looking at a

265
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:31,208
button is when you adopt a conservation

266
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:33,850
system you are looking at a long term

267
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,979
investment especially with soil health

268
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,439
it's going to take time it depends on

269
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,909
how degraded your soil is you're gonna

270
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,769
see actually I think they say that

271
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:46,139
you'll see more benefits thicker and

272
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,139
more degraded soil then very improve

273
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,689
their economic from also result in

274
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:57,338
economic benefits um

275
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:59,678
and an example is the the reduced yield

276
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,379
variability so if you're reducing risk

277
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:03,879
as soil health increases you're not

278
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,980
going to get them as much of a wild

279
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,449
swing in yields that you might have had

280
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,159
before and sometimes that's hard to

281
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:11,798
quantify and it's something to be

282
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,928
discussed and in order to realize the

283
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,970
greatest benefits for the system you

284
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:18,999
have to figure out the system that works

285
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,989
best on your operation given your

286
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:25,230
challenges and goals and I think that's

287
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:25,230
it

288
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:36,720
this has been a production of Cornell
