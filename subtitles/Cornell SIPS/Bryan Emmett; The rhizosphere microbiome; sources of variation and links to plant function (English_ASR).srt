1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:08,490
University and thank you everybody for

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,259
coming today it's really nice to be back

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,900
in the Horticulture Department I'm just

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:18,118
down the road now at DTI

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,579
but nonetheless this section sorry I

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:24,059
started in 2009 when departments still

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,679
existed instead so thank you doc it's

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,689
great to be back and to see familiar

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,579
faces and to have the opportunity to

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,460
share my PhD work with you today

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:39,770
so I like to start these talks on the

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,739
sorry on the rhizosphere microbiome I

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,719
like to start with the technical glitch

15
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:47,519
and then move on to thinking about why

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,800
we think about the rhizosphere and the

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,230
plant microbiome in general and for me

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,209
much of this is focused around the story

19
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,398
of nitrogen and agricultural systems as

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,079
you know it's a plant limiting nutrient

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,730
and most of our terrestrial systems

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,250
certainly in agricultural systems and

23
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,588
the application of nitrogen to our

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,239
agricultural lands has enabled a really

25
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,719
steep increase in the yields of those

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,188
lands

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,048
so as US average yields have gone up

28
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:16,019
over the last century so has nitrogen

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,460
application gone up for much of it and

30
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:23,009
it's going to enable continued gains in

31
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,259
productivity as well but there is a cost

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,700
so some of this and when nitrogen is

33
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,439
applied in excess or when it leaves

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,600
those agricultural lands it can leave as

35
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,508
a greenhouse gas nitrous oxide it can

36
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,489
also enter the waterways lead to

37
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,959
eutrophication so this is just a picture

38
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,618
of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of

39
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,199
Mexico a result of nutrient loading in

40
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,819
the Mississippi River Basin and so the

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,259
challenge of crafting sustainable

42
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,789
systems in the future is how do we

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,509
maintain that plant productivity without

44
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,450
loading these environmental

45
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,989
externalities the rhizosphere is a

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,670
really exciting object to study in this

47
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,798
regard because it's a hot spot of

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,560
nutrient and nitrogen cycling in soil

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,969
and this nutrient cycling is really

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,789
driven by the fact that the plants

51
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:11,159
release about 3 to 30% of their fixed

52
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,279
photosynthate into the rhizosphere e

53
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,949
there is plant root exudates

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,810
or riser deposits and this carbon flow

55
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:24,979
enables a microbiome that is really

56
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:27,920
distinct from bulk soil it's both more

57
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,959
abundant more active and different in

58
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,849
composition and not only is the

59
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,080
composition different but we also see

60
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,209
that some of the process rates are

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,950
different as well and so we often see

62
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,170
increased rates of decomposition in the

63
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:41,719
rhizosphere and associated nitrogen

64
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:44,179
mineralization some of the estimates are

65
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,219
as high as ten times the amount of gross

66
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,080
nitrogen mineralization occurring in the

67
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,780
zone around plant roots is in bulk soil

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,790
and so this is a substantial nutrient

69
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,330
flow that might be available for the

70
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:57,409
plant to take advantage of and that

71
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,070
plants and their micro biomes may be

72
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,439
able to to tap into and when I find also

73
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,060
exciting is not only is this compartment

74
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,009
different from bulk soil but we see

75
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,080
variation between plants plant species

76
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:11,149
and even plant genotypes and their

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,219
impact on this environment the

78
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,469
composition of the microbial community

79
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:17,539
there and some of the process rates that

80
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:19,729
were interested in so in a horticulture

81
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,319
Department this is an interesting point

82
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,959
of intervention that we can have and

83
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,629
these met managed landscapes if we can

84
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,610
choose plants that harvest a beneficial

85
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,379
microbiome then we may be able to manage

86
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,890
some of these processes and supportive

87
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,389
plant productivity well while we know

88
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,548
that there's some plant variation in

89
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,018
this environment in the microbial

90
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,569
community that resides there we don't

91
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,849
have a good handle on or a good

92
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,379
predictive framework for understanding

93
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,259
which plants are going to have which

94
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,909
effects on on the rhizosphere and so one

95
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,699
of my main research questions is trying

96
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,859
to get a handle on at least in the types

97
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,259
of plants that we put into agricultural

98
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,370
fields what might be some sources of

99
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,750
variation in their rhizosphere effects

100
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,959
and again you know we're interested in

101
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,449
plant resource acquisition and so are

102
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,519
these impacts on the res is fear

103
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,500
bacterial community composition its

104
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,480
metabolism are they linked with

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,949
differences in plant growth and nitrogen

106
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,870
uptake in the fields and then finally

107
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,180
I'll end on a story looking back and

108
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,370
asking the question of has modern

109
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,269
breeding altered these relationships has

110
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,370
modern breeding influenced

111
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,959
Rises for your composition or function

112
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,840
as we've bred plants for our

113
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,378
agricultural landscapes have we changed

114
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:39,239
these interactions in any way the way we

115
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,740
address these questions and this will

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,560
hold true for all of the experiments

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,829
that I share today is a basic common

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,500
garden type experiment so we take a

119
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,818
range of plant diversity we plant it in

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,379
the same environment under the same

121
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,139
conditions and then we can see how the

122
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:59,479
plant genetics changed the phenotype

123
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,439
that we're interested in in the first

124
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,288
experiment that I'll share with you we

125
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,769
focused on maize and a handful of c4

126
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:10,139
grasses but also some broader diversity

127
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:14,158
including some dicots and legumes as

128
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,430
well and what this allows us to do is to

129
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:20,038
test things like our is plant

130
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,228
phylogenetic distance related to the

131
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,149
microbial community differences in the

132
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,918
microbial community between these plants

133
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,279
our plants that are farther apart on

134
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,329
this phylogenetic tree also share

135
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,299
differing more in their microbial

136
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,550
community and there's some indication

137
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,460
that this holds both in the rhizosphere

138
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,800
of the PO AC and the mammalian gut

139
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,989
microbiome that evolutionary history of

140
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,468
the organisms play a role in their

141
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,788
microbiome in shaping their microbiome

142
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:52,649
but it hasn't really been tested in the

143
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:54,658
field for for plants additionally these

144
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,500
plants are also distinct in other ways

145
00:05:54,658 --> 00:06:00,778
and so there's a handful of crop plants

146
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,569
with large growth growth potential

147
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:05,158
sorghum maize sunflower some

148
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,620
agricultural weeds that are highlighted

149
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:09,990
in orange which have a different life

150
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,360
history strategy perhaps and then even a

151
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,430
legume and so another hypothesis

152
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,900
hypothesis would be that plants that are

153
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,468
functionally similar that share similar

154
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,049
growth characteristics may have similar

155
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:23,879
effects on the microbiome and plants

156
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,439
that are further apart they have more

157
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,639
disparate micro biomes so as I said we

158
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,579
plant these out in the field we use

159
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,098
replicated monocultures shown in the

160
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,370
upper right hand corner here we maintain

161
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:40,588
weed free bare soil control plots so we

162
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,199
can compare the rhizosphere samples that

163
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:43,000
we're collecting

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,129
soyal that's not under the influence of

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,819
plant roots and then we split these

166
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,230
plots with a nitrogen application of

167
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,110
zero or ninety five kilograms of

168
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,330
nitrogen correct there too to assay the

169
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,970
plant characteristics and the

170
00:06:55,329 --> 00:07:01,779
rhizosphere traits under conditions of

171
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,870
severe and limitation or greater and

172
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,269
availability then we sampled all of

173
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,910
these plants at flowering time which is

174
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:12,339
an important distinction that you'll

175
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,840
hear more of as this talk goes on and we

176
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,229
did that because there's increasing

177
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,359
evidence that as plants go through their

178
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,700
phenology there Rises for your impacts

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
are changing and so rather than sampling

180
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,539
all these plants at the same time we

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,729
decided to set the phenological stage of

182
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:33,010
flowering and sample them all at that

183
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:35,319
point we harvest the above-ground

184
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,389
portions of the plant to measure biomass

185
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,849
nitrogen uptake if that we can calculate

186
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,829
nitrogen use efficiency which for us is

187
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,510
a very broad definition of just the

188
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,979
amount of carbon that the plant can fix

189
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,279
for the amount of nitrogen then it takes

190
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:52,210
off from the soil we dig the plants up

191
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,979
and we collect soil from around the

192
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,310
roots as well as intact roots and

193
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,379
adhering rhizosphere soils for profiling

194
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,740
the bacterial community and we're using

195
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,949
a 16s rRNA approach for that and then

196
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,170
collect the soil as well for lab based

197
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,870
assay of microbial community activity an

198
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,780
extracellular enzyme based assay so you

199
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,490
can get a idea of microbial metabolism

200
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:20,379
in soil and so some of the data the

201
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,340
first thing to note and I mentioned that

202
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,620
flowering time is going to be an

203
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,989
important thread through this section of

204
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,850
the talk is that when we're looking at

205
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,460
the plant traits that we measure not

206
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,920
surprisingly how long these plants grew

207
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,629
is the major source of variation so we

208
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,629
were looking for functional variation in

209
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:40,330
the plants and how long they're in the

210
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:43,090
ground for how long they take to flower

211
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,700
is the major dimension of diversity and

212
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:49,690
so flowering time whether it's biomass

213
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,790
or here I'm showing an uptake flowering

214
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,600
time describes most of the variability

215
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,599
in that

216
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,980
these extracellular enzymes for those of

217
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,330
you who aren't aware or just a reminder

218
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,980
these are extra cellular enzymes that

219
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,620
are produced by microbes released into

220
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,350
the soil break down organic

221
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,470
macromolecules cellulose lignocellulose

222
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,649
protein chitin releasing monomers that

223
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,290
are available for plant plant uptake in

224
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,899
the process liberating nitrogen and

225
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:25,089
phosphorus for the microbes as well

226
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,009
and if those microbes die or turn over

227
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:39,190
that those nutrients may be available

228
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:43,929
for the plant all right so a light show

229
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,730
to in so measuring these enzymes with us

230
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:48,699
through this assay we can get a picture

231
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,519
of microbial allocation in soil to these

232
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,860
different sort of pools of carbon that

233
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,929
are available or carbon and nitrogen in

234
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,970
the case of the lower two that are

235
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,219
available to them and we can measure the

236
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,779
same thing in the rhizosphere and we can

237
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,000
see this rhizosphere effect that I was

238
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,159
alluding to earlier an increase in the

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,330
activity of these EXO enzymes in the

240
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:15,549
rhizosphere soil for the 16s rRNA

241
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,050
profiling where essentially we're

242
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,029
collecting these roots from the field

243
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,149
we're taking intact roots and

244
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,789
rhizosphere soil extracting the DNA

245
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:27,459
amplifying a portion of the 16s rRNA the

246
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:30,490
v4 variable region and then sequencing

247
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,540
that on the aluminum iseek instrument we

248
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,110
run that through a bioinformatics

249
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,699
pipeline where we're demultiplexing

250
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,389
do a quality control and then we cluster

251
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,860
those at 96 7% similarity among the

252
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,919
sequences to form what we call

253
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,590
operational taxonomic units which are

254
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,799
just what we think of as taxa in this

255
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,950
data and that gives us two two forms of

256
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,899
data we have essentially species lists

257
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,320
that are occurring in each sample and

258
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:01,539
the relative abundance and then we can

259
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,910
take those and calculate dissimilarity

260
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:06,909
matrices which is comparing each sample

261
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:08,499
to each other how close is the

262
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,379
composition in one sample

263
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:14,528
to another and I'll share both types of

264
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:17,048
data with you today so this is taking

265
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:18,548
that distance matrices or donating it

266
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:21,489
showing it in a two-dimensional space

267
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:23,818
and essentially each dot represents a

268
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:27,309
microbial community a sample of a

269
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:30,519
memorial community those dots which are

270
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:31,808
closer together are more similar in the

271
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,369
composition of that community those

272
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:37,808
which are further apart are more

273
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:39,579
distinct so right off the bat there's a

274
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,688
very strong rhizosphere effect and

275
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:47,138
bacterial community composition these

276
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:49,238
triangles are all bare soil plots and

277
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,129
then these dots and you can see a very

278
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,929
clear separation and a wise separation

279
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:56,619
between the rhizosphere samples and the

280
00:11:52,928 --> 00:12:00,278
bare soil samples explaining about 25%

281
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:02,379
of the variation in the data set now the

282
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:04,719
same same ordination color the same way

283
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,548
but the the color coding is actually the

284
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:08,589
day we're sampling and so what I'm

285
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:10,619
highlighting here is that what day we go

286
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,169
out and we collect these samples

287
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:16,809
influences about 33% of the variation in

288
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:18,399
the data set and that variation is

289
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:21,969
driven largely by the rhizosphere

290
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,528
samples so flowering time is image and

291
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,418
it's very important as far as the plant

292
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:27,129
characteristics that we're measuring we

293
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:30,698
also find it's very important in the

294
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:33,908
actual composition of the community in

295
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:35,618
the rhizosphere that said we can control

296
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:38,379
for it and then we can see what amount

297
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:42,489
of variation we can partition to the

298
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:45,579
plant genotype or skews effect and we

299
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:47,829
see about another 20% of that variation

300
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:50,738
so plant genotype and species is having

301
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:54,698
a substantial influence on the microbial

302
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:56,079
community and the colored dots in this

303
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:58,838
one are just indicating different

304
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,338
different species or genotypes not

305
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,399
supposed to be able to make sense of

306
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:05,739
that range of colored dots right now but

307
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,808
if you look you can see that these light

308
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:10,089
green ones separating here there's some

309
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:12,608
light blue ones so there you can pick it

310
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,979
up visually as well now in contrast

311
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:17,109
something like fertilization in the

312
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:19,479
rhizosphere really isn't that having

313
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:21,900
that great of an influence on the

314
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:23,639
microbial community that we measure it's

315
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,259
mystically significant because we have a

316
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,480
very large and when we're running this

317
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,460
test but it's only about one percent of

318
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,470
the variation that we're observing can

319
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,330
we attribute to the nitrogen

320
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:38,610
fertilization so that's great but that's

321
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,990
kind of where I started the the talk is

322
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,278
that we know that there's this variation

323
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:48,659
between species and genotypes but we

324
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:50,700
want to know what leads to that so

325
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:53,699
another way of looking at that and here

326
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,080
on the y-axis is you can think of as the

327
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,759
difference in microbial community

328
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,528
composition we're using a weighted unit

329
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,230
rack measured for that so that takes

330
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:03,120
into account both the composition of the

331
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,800
bacterial community but also the

332
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,250
phylogenetic relationships within that

333
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:11,519
community and then on the y-axis is the

334
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,339
days between harvest for each sample and

335
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,939
so what we see is a positive

336
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,880
relationship between time of sampling

337
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,310
and the microbial community composition

338
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,169
those samples that are collected further

339
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,088
apart are more likely to be distinct

340
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,219
those samples which are closed sampled

341
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:33,120
on similar dates more likely to be

342
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,220
shared and this is the the largest

343
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,929
source of variation in our in our data

344
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,190
set again we can control for that and we

345
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,289
can look at the same thing looking at

346
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,709
plant evolutionary distance and so we

347
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:48,870
used chloroplast our VCO and that

348
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,479
cadence to reconstruct a phylogeny of

349
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,110
these plants and we see a positive

350
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,580
significant relationship with the

351
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,169
weighted unifor act distant measurement

352
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,270
essentially saying that plants that are

353
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,849
more distantly related are more likely

354
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,009
to have a microbial community in the

355
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,560
rhizosphere that's more distinct and I

356
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,958
think it's much easier to visualize when

357
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,349
we sort of bin it into groups so if we

358
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,199
take it from the same genotype versus

359
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,180
within a species within a family or

360
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,060
between families we've heard of seed

361
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:27,669
more likely to get samples that are

362
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:29,409
distinct in composition so we wanted to

363
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:31,120
dive in and look at some of the

364
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:34,809
functional differences between plants

365
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,399
and what were the the effects on the

366
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,000
microbial community that these variables

367
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,110
were having and so this is another

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,750
ordination but some of you may be

369
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,029
familiar with redundancy analyses and

370
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,490
essentially what I'm doing is I'm

371
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,230
constraining the ordination to only show

372
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,570
that variation in the microbial

373
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,240
community that is explained by these

374
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,980
four explanatory variables and so we're

375
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,190
showing you a subset of the variation

376
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,360
and the relationships among this species

377
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:06,130
and how they relate and we we chose

378
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,480
these four variables because you know

379
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,889
days to flowering was the most

380
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,200
significant source of variation in the

381
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:14,279
data set but also plant nitrogen use

382
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,210
efficiency seed size and nitrogen uptake

383
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,059
nitrogen uptake was what you're mainly

384
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,680
interested in and the two other

385
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:22,239
variables were also significant

386
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,939
predictors though I didn't didn't show

387
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,919
you that data when we put these together

388
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,950
in an ordination what we find is that

389
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:33,639
all of these load very strongly on on

390
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:37,509
one axis and they essentially separate

391
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:40,870
out the plants on one side we have some

392
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:44,559
some meteor plants our barnyard grass

393
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,990
foxtail velvetleaf as well as some lower

394
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,569
carbon nitrogen use efficiency plants

395
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,669
crop plants so there's teff and finger

396
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,260
millet and here as well and then on the

397
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:56,049
other side some longer-lived

398
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,000
higher nitrogen use efficiency crop

399
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01,649
plants such as maize sunflower and

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,820
sorghum and so there's this life history

401
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,769
difference that are separating plants

402
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,870
out that's related to both their plant

403
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:11,799
traits and associated with differences

404
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,099
in the microbial community as well we

405
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,928
can

406
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,178
take the tax in abundance and then

407
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,169
correlate it with this axis this first

408
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:23,709
axis of the ordination and so every dot

409
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:27,009
on this graph is is one of the taxa in

410
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,808
the data set those that are grey aren't

411
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:33,970
significantly correlated with that axis

412
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:35,889
those in red are and they're spread to

413
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,440
the left or right is essentially the

414
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,570
change in abundance as you go as you

415
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,400
move to the right or left of this axis

416
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:45,069
so these red dots are positively

417
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,038
correlated with the side of the axis

418
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:52,329
these red dots are with that side of the

419
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:54,788
axis and what jumps out is that there's

420
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:57,819
very strong phylogenetic selection on

421
00:17:54,788 --> 00:18:01,259
the microbial community there's quite a

422
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:03,689
few Actinobacteria so this one phylum

423
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,710
that's strongly selected by these

424
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:12,909
long-lived high nitrogen use efficiency

425
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:14,890
plants and so we have a a plant life

426
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,870
history difference and some sort of

427
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,970
files genetic selection on the

428
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:20,739
rhizosphere microbiome and for those of

429
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,600
you are familiar the actinobacteria are

430
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,819
filamentous bacteria and so there may be

431
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,819
a morphological selection as well

432
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:32,019
we can further overlay some of the

433
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,808
enzyme data that we had and see how that

434
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:37,269
really how that matches some of these

435
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:39,819
relationships and so the three things

436
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:41,259
that I've highlighted are one leucine

437
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:44,589
immuno peptidase that's a protein

438
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:46,589
degrading enzyme in Ag is a as a chitin

439
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:48,788
a so these are both carbon and nitrogen

440
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,408
accessing enzyme and these are

441
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,179
negatively correlated with the axis

442
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,278
which is telling you that these are more

443
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:58,389
active potentially more active in these

444
00:18:56,278 --> 00:19:00,219
longer lived higher nitrogen use

445
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,959
efficiency plants and this makes sense

446
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:03,278
these are plants that have to be in the

447
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,889
ground for a longer period of time

448
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:09,729
during the growing season they're

449
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:12,398
putting more resources into green for

450
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:14,080
the following season versus some weedy

451
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:17,439
or shorter lived species that maybe

452
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,108
don't have the same resource demands on

453
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,019
the soil or effects on soil over time

454
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:25,418
and also correlated with that axis is

455
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:28,479
inorganic in content so you can start to

456
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:31,119
see the congruence between some of the

457
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:36,729
the chemical variables the microbiome

458
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:39,608
and some of the plant traits as well all

459
00:19:36,729 --> 00:19:41,409
right so to wrap up this initial part we

460
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:44,048
we see that host phylogeny does

461
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,969
influence rhizosphere bacterial

462
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:50,558
community composition a small but

463
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:52,960
significant effect and then that we see

464
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,628
this relationship in plant life history

465
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,649
strategy with the bacterial community as

466
00:19:55,628 --> 00:20:01,329
well but I hope that you're wondering

467
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:03,218
you know how much of this is actually

468
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:06,069
influenced by the plants that we've

469
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:08,440
selected and their variation versus just

470
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,908
this decision to sample at flowering

471
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,119
time because we sort we certainly were

472
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,649
and then are these trends actually

473
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:16,388
linked with patterns of growth and

474
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,308
nitrogen uptake that are can be

475
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:21,848
separated from these differences in

476
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:25,088
flowering time so we ran another

477
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:27,428
experiment and this time we we focused

478
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:29,469
in on a subset of the variation that we

479
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:32,379
asked it in the first experiment we use

480
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:35,048
two maize hybrids and then sort of four

481
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:36,759
species that attempted to encompass the

482
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:40,960
functional variation that we observed in

483
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,079
the first so we used buckwheat forage

484
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,630
millet

485
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,428
Soudan grass and sunflower as well and

486
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,610
we planted these in a 20-year organic

487
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:53,000
field up in pinion in the summer of 2015

488
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,729
and here we sampled instead of sampling

489
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,369
at flower time we sampled it set dates

490
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,990
based on the phenology of maize so at

491
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:03,139
the vegetative stage which I'll show us

492
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,140
v6 its flowering stage r1 and grain

493
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,030
filling but we can now track what are

494
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,400
the species effects versus what are the

495
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:14,750
temporal effects in this data set we

496
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,009
added a fertility treatment again so

497
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,799
that we could see how these plants are

498
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,500
responding to resource availability it's

499
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,819
an organic field so we can't add

500
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,819
synthetic nitrogen to create this but

501
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:29,599
instead we mowed swaths of clover from

502
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:32,629
the season before and then transferred

503
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,119
that off of the the low end plots to the

504
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,070
high end plots transferring about 55

505
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,699
kilograms of nitrogen per hectare to set

506
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:43,519
up a fertility gradient and we measure

507
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,590
many of the same things and so here is

508
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,599
some of the basic growth data and I just

509
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:49,970
want to draw your attention to the fact

510
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,099
that these plants do vary in their

511
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,839
growth over the course of the season and

512
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:58,849
the one thing that I want to highlight

513
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:00,799
is that this is relative growth rate two

514
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:02,509
of these plants the Soudan grass and the

515
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,169
millet are really maintaining higher

516
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:08,420
rates of growth longer into the growing

517
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,050
season than than the others and so the

518
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,580
maize the sunflower and the buckwheat

519
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:20,509
are all decreasing their relative growth

520
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:21,889
rate at a faster pace measure nitrogen

521
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,720
uptake so we can see how nitrogen uptake

522
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,090
dynamics changes over the course of the

523
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,789
season and here I just want to note that

524
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:30,558
it's at the flowering time sampling

525
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,558
where nitrogen uptake is that it's

526
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:36,500
highest it peaks for almost all the

527
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,750
species at that point it's also when it

528
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,269
appears that nitrogen is most limiting

529
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,009
from the soil and so the bottom panel

530
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,558
graphs are broken out by each species

531
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,808
but they're also shown in the solid

532
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,879
lines show nitrogen rate of nitrogen

533
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,379
uptake in the plots where clover was

534
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,970
removed and the dotted lines show

535
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,870
nitrogen uptake and the plots where

536
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,990
clover was added

537
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:59,519
and it's only at this harvest at

538
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,930
flowering time where we start to see a

539
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,049
significant difference in the rate of

540
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,180
nitrogen uptake between the fertility

541
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,669
treatments which is telling us that at

542
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,180
this point nitrogen supply from soil is

543
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,769
limiting and the fertility treatment is

544
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,170
making a difference whereas it's not

545
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:23,609
limiting either before or really after

546
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:25,320
for that matter here's some enzyme data

547
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:27,299
again and I'm showing you just the

548
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,889
cellulose degrading enzyme and the

549
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:34,289
protease because I think they're the

550
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,240
most interesting story but these black

551
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,399
dots represent the bare soil while the

552
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,319
colored dots again represents the plant

553
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,970
rhizosphere semblance is though the

554
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,250
first thing to note on the top panel is

555
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,900
that the yellow and the blue dots that

556
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,480
represent the maize species or maize

557
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,040
genotypes they have this strong

558
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,140
rhizosphere effect on a cellulose

559
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,240
degrading enzyme early in the season

560
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,280
that's maintained through flowering and

561
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,789
that effect really is not observed for

562
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:02,579
any of the other species that we that we

563
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,379
assayed and so there seems to be some

564
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,230
species influence on microbial

565
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,929
metabolism in the soil that we can see

566
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,308
in our enzyme data the second thing I

567
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,530
want to highlight is with the protease

568
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:15,839
we don't observe a rhizosphere effect

569
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:17,910
early in the season but here at

570
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,849
flowering where nitrogen demand is

571
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,590
highest across the plant species there's

572
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:27,058
a positive rhizosphere effect on

573
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:27,558
potential enzyme activity and just a

574
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:29,298
reminder

575
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:31,819
course this is when we see nitrogen

576
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:34,398
being limiting nitrogen soil supply

577
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:35,538
being limiting and nitrogen demand at

578
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,069
its peak from the plant

579
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:39,798
so there's a synchrony between plant

580
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:44,628
nitrogen demand nitrogen supply from the

581
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:48,859
soil and the metabolism microbial

582
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:50,509
metabolism in the rhizosphere we can

583
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:54,079
dive deeper into this time point and

584
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:56,690
here I'm just regressing the rhizosphere

585
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,460
effect on this enzyme activity versus

586
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,788
the rate of nitrogen uptake for those

587
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,919
plots or species and we see a positive a

588
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:06,829
significant positive relationship in

589
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,700
these so we see synchrony importantly

590
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:12,259
but also the variation between species

591
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,389
in their effect is linearly correlated

592
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:19,730
with their nitrogen demand and this is

593
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:22,158
really exciting because if we think that

594
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,079
you know these enzymes the res fear

595
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,809
effect on these enzymes is a mechanism

596
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,788
of plant nitrogen supply and that this

597
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:30,798
represents nitrogen mineralization in

598
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:33,499
the rhizosphere which granted is a big

599
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:37,308
leap this data would be consistent with

600
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:38,960
nitrogen supply that is a result of the

601
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:40,519
rhizosphere effect and that's nitrogen

602
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,298
that's feeding a planet and that's not

603
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:48,710
available for loss from the system or an

604
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:51,950
eventual runoff so looking at the

605
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,860
microbial community data this is an

606
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,379
ordination that's been faceted into

607
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,898
three panels and so each of these panels

608
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:02,178
share the same ordination space but

609
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:04,158
instead only the points that are shown

610
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:06,830
are from the first second and third

611
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,470
sampling and so here we can see the

612
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:13,460
difference both over time and between

613
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,808
the species in our in our data set so

614
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,429
the first thing to note is that sampling

615
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,928
date does have a large effect in fact

616
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:19,730
the rhizosphere effect seems to be

617
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:21,798
getting stronger over the course of the

618
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,649
season and more distinct from bulk soil

619
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:27,918
and that's explaining about 11% of the

620
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:29,508
variation in our data set but also plant

621
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,820
genotype or species is having a very

622
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:36,798
strong effect to explaining more of the

623
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:39,168
variation even 18% but I think most

624
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,359
interestingly the there's this

625
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:44,059
interaction between genotype

626
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,649
and sampling date so about 10% of the

627
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:48,410
variations explained by this interaction

628
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:50,480
and essentially what we see in the

629
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,759
ordination is that plants are having

630
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,410
divergent effects on the microbial

631
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,720
community over the course of the season

632
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,670
essentially shaping the succession of

633
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,429
the rhizosphere microbiome in different

634
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,380
ways and so at our first sampling the

635
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:06,590
difference between species is really you

636
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,210
can't really pick it up visually but as

637
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:09,949
you move into flowering time you start

638
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,990
to see sort of these green points on the

639
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,690
sunflower that clouds separating up to

640
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,308
the upper right-hand quadrant Sudan

641
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,990
grass these red points beginning to

642
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:23,119
separate down and by the third sampling

643
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,839
millet Sudan grass sunflower and maize

644
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,329
all really in their own portions of the

645
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,699
ordination so not only a species having

646
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:33,529
an influence on the microbiome but it's

647
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:41,150
affecting the succession of that

648
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:42,649
community as well all right I promise

649
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,710
this will be the last of these that I

650
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,970
show you but again this is a constrained

651
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,548
ordination so we're looking at the

652
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,490
variation in the data set that in this

653
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:54,139
case is correlated or explained by these

654
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,109
other growth characteristics and I use a

655
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,250
slightly different set of growth

656
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,039
characteristics because we have better

657
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,019
measurements in this in this data set so

658
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,879
we have relative growth rate total

659
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:07,579
biomass accumulation and the rate of

660
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,110
nitrogen uptake and that nitrogen use

661
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:11,720
efficiency or the plant carbon to

662
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:13,428
nitrogen ratio metric and what we what

663
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,009
we see is that these plants really

664
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,390
separate predominantly on an axis that's

665
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:21,039
best explained by differences in

666
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:25,910
relative growth rate and so these

667
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:28,808
species millet Sudan grass occupying one

668
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:32,660
side of the axis and sunflower and maize

669
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:35,298
occupying another side of the axis and

670
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,120
when we look at the correlations with

671
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:39,558
the microbial community associated with

672
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,779
these axis we start to see a very

673
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,250
similar pattern some slight differences

674
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:44,990
with what we saw before but a similar

675
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,759
pattern where again the Actinobacteria

676
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,329
are associated with this group of

677
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,799
species lower growth rate higher biomass

678
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:54,710
accumulation over the course of the

679
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,798
season and a bra

680
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,298
their swath of diversity associated with

681
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:03,619
the plants with a higher relative growth

682
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:05,450
rate now there are a handful of other

683
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,908
things that are popping up not just the

684
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,759
actinobacteria in this game and one of

685
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:12,350
them is a group of chlorophyll XE and so

686
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,898
I mentioned before that you know the

687
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:17,869
actinobacteria are notable for this

688
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:20,509
filamentous lifestyle and the

689
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:22,548
chlorophyll XE the best hit to the group

690
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:25,490
that was changing was this family that

691
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:27,619
Contino back to your AC which is also a

692
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,950
filament dis bacteria and then of course

693
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:34,788
there's a burr cold area which is a

694
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:37,250
broad general BART broad genus many

695
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:39,230
plant growth promoting bacteria in this

696
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,480
genus including some nitrogen fixers so

697
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,000
it's not surprising to see it in the

698
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,130
rhizosphere but i think the fact that

699
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,179
this we're seeing this selection on the

700
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:53,778
filamentous lifestyle and this subset of

701
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:56,509
the octina bacteria now in two different

702
00:29:53,778 --> 00:30:01,058
experiments in two different soils two

703
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:01,058
different years but associated with

704
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,140
similar sort of life history traits i

705
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:09,859
think is is notable and probably worth

706
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,549
following up so what have we learned so

707
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:15,648
far some of the enzyme data pointed out

708
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:17,750
that the rhizosphere function is is very

709
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:21,829
well coupled with plant nitrogen demand

710
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,390
in the data that plant species are

711
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:25,460
shaping the rises for your community

712
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,788
composition and the successional trends

713
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,610
in the data and then again these were

714
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:32,750
lower relative growth rate plants

715
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:34,219
favoring a subset of the microbial

716
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,929
community dominated by the

717
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,230
Actinobacteria and other filamentous

718
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:41,929
bacteria and so what do I think is going

719
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,788
on here there's been some work that has

720
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:45,679
looked at differences among plants and

721
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:47,210
relative growth rate and particularly

722
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,630
how they maintain that relative growth

723
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,100
rate under nutrient stress and Rises

724
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,320
fear effects as well and what they find

725
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:57,109
is a positive relationship between plant

726
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,538
relative growth rate and rises for your

727
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,119
carbon flow and in those plants that are

728
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:04,369
growing faster maintaining higher rgr

729
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,439
higher carbon flow then there's

730
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:08,429
increased microbial growth and turnover

731
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,890
in the rhizosphere of those plants

732
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:15,240
and so we can imagine that our plants

733
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,310
might be on the same axis and that those

734
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,859
those plants that are slowing their

735
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:22,200
relative growth rate later in the season

736
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:24,329
are is mirrored by a decrease in carbon

737
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,069
flow in the rhizosphere and thus a

738
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:28,500
narrowing of the ecological niche that

739
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:32,039
is somehow favoring the subset of the

740
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,140
community verses plants so this is a

741
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:37,799
picture of teff a lower nitrogen use

742
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:41,100
efficiency grass but that may be

743
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,799
maintaining higher rates of carbon flow

744
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:51,419
and then thus a greater diversity of

745
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:53,849
organisms in the rhizosphere okay so the

746
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:57,180
last thing I want to share with you

747
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:59,819
today is is really it's a means of

748
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,850
looking backwards in preparation to look

749
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:05,730
forward that is if it rises for your

750
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:07,379
selections associations can be selected

751
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,870
and bred for then it may be possible

752
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:14,010
that indirectly we've been selecting for

753
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:15,989
certain associations over time and so

754
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:18,779
we're back to this picture of changing

755
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,880
nitrogen use and increasing yields and

756
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,829
so the nitrogen management portion of

757
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,850
this is one component but also we've

758
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:28,619
been breeding over the course of this

759
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:31,439
60-year history in this graph and

760
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:32,939
breeding for improved yields in these

761
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,860
environments and so how is breeding

762
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,259
interacted with changing management

763
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:42,509
regimes and what are the implications on

764
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:44,670
that for the rhizosphere effects and we

765
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,589
can think of a sort of a simple

766
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:50,759
hypothesis would be if we've replaced

767
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:53,490
the soil nutrient flows with additional

768
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,440
externally applied nitrogen fertilizer

769
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:59,490
and we've been breeding for plants that

770
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,660
do well in that system we may have bred

771
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,769
for plants that as the throughout the

772
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,690
breeding history that are better at

773
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:09,329
taking up nitrogen from from fertilizer

774
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,610
but there may be a cost or there may be

775
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:14,069
relaxed selection on traits that are

776
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:16,289
supporting the plant gaining soil

777
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:18,029
nitrogen nitrogen from soil pools so

778
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:20,399
there may be a trade-off over that

779
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,649
period of time if we think about it and

780
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,290
turn

781
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:27,940
of microbial community similarity if

782
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:31,000
there's a relaxed selection on

783
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,690
rhizosphere traits over time then plants

784
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,640
that are really bred and released at in

785
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,980
similar time periods would be more

786
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,810
likely to have similar microbial

787
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,250
community composition whereas maybe

788
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,950
plants that were released early and

789
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,829
early in the history versus late in the

790
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:52,000
history may be more distinct effects on

791
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:54,939
the rhizosphere microbial community and

792
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,740
so to test this pioneer hi-bred

793
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,690
international now to pond pioneer

794
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,140
maintains a collection of their

795
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,630
best-selling hybrids from 1936 through

796
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,580
present-day and they provided us with

797
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,070
seed of 12 of the best-selling hybrid

798
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:11,289
sort of spanning this range and we

799
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,390
planted those out and another field

800
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,719
experiment at the Musgrave research farm

801
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:19,119
in Aurora replicated monocultures and

802
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,489
this time we planted them at 0 85 and

803
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,639
170 kilograms of nitrogen prac there

804
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:26,219
that we can assay there their response

805
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,949
and their effects on the rhizosphere

806
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:32,678
both that a nitrogen limited conditions

807
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:33,869
and presumably to nitrogen excess as

808
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,300
well

809
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,829
now nitrogen management management is

810
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,940
not the only thing that's changed over

811
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:43,690
the course of this history and certainly

812
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,360
planting density is a major change and

813
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,190
so we we used an intermediate planning

814
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,710
density of about 60,000 plants per

815
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,460
hectare that allowed us to maintain

816
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,679
nitrogen limiting conditions but also

817
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,510
our earliest releases could still

818
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,680
tolerate it and stand throughout the

819
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,050
season without falling over

820
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,539
at higher higher modern densities they

821
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:08,500
wouldn't be able to this experient

822
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:10,269
experiment also included 15n tracer and

823
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,829
that allows us to differentiate even

824
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:13,599
under fertilized conditions what the

825
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,090
plants are getting from soil pools

826
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,400
versus applied fertilizer from that

827
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,860
season I'm not actually going to share

828
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:27,430
that data with you just for for time

829
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:29,590
limitations and so we can plot the

830
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:31,659
changes the the yield of these hybrids

831
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,700
versus the years when they were released

832
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,269
and we can look for trends and what

833
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,189
should jump out

834
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:39,099
to you is this is not the hypothesis

835
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:42,250
that I originally presented instead if

836
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:46,239
we look at both grain yield and nitrogen

837
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:49,599
uptake there's positive trends with year

838
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,759
of release in both datasets so the

839
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,739
modern plants are modern hybrids are

840
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,210
higher yielding under high nitrogen

841
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:57,309
conditions and under low nitrogen

842
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,840
conditions but not only that they're

843
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:01,389
taking up more nitrogen under both

844
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,720
conditions as well and so it seems this

845
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:05,949
breeding history has actually improved

846
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,609
plant resource acquisition under

847
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:11,949
unfertilized conditions if we look at

848
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,840
their rhizosphere so another ordination

849
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:17,649
this is showing the centroids and the

850
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,390
standard error of the samples placement

851
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,329
on this ordination and if we color those

852
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:25,539
by year of release here these red points

853
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:29,579
are our earliest releases and these blue

854
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:31,960
points are our latest release releases

855
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,869
and what you see is they actually line

856
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,970
up very close together so there's not a

857
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:39,069
lot of difference between the first

858
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:41,199
releases and the and the latest releases

859
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,390
there is some significant differences

860
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,579
between the hybrids but those are

861
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:48,150
largely driven by the middle releases

862
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:50,319
that releases from the 1960s and 70s

863
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:55,240
which seem to be separating from the

864
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,090
group somewhat so our second hypothesis

865
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:00,339
that the microbial community is changing

866
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,440
there's been some changes but but not

867
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,000
exactly what we were predicting and this

868
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,429
becomes very clear if we look at

869
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,820
differential abundance of particular

870
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:12,579
taxa so this is comparing the abundance

871
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:15,730
of all of our taxa to the abundance in

872
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:18,090
the earliest release and we see no

873
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,500
differences no significant changes

874
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,269
through any of the hybrids except for

875
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,559
these middle release hybrids from the

876
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:28,420
60s 70s where we start to see some

877
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:32,690
change in the composition of that

878
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,579
community and if we look at the

879
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,889
I'm data again there is some variation

880
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:41,690
among the hybrids but it tells a similar

881
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:44,809
story the the modern and the oldest

882
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,119
releases are still rather similar to

883
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:50,420
each other in their enzyme profiles but

884
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,730
it's this release from the 1970s which

885
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:58,608
is really standing out and is distinct

886
00:37:52,730 --> 00:38:01,159
from the others and so so where are we

887
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:03,139
you know we can reevaluate this idea

888
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,239
that maybe the luxury nitrogen has

889
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:08,389
relaxed selection and the microbial

890
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:13,009
community and if we if we look back to

891
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:15,170
this graph again the perhaps once in the

892
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:18,400
in this period from the 1960s and 70s

893
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:21,289
where there was rapid increases in

894
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,539
nitrogen applications to agricultural

895
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:25,670
lands perhaps then there was truly

896
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:28,579
luxuriant and great and surplus in the

897
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,460
systems but certainly over the last 30

898
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:32,900
to 40 years those nitrogen app rates of

899
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,358
nitrogen application have been stable

900
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,369
and yet yields have continued to go up

901
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:41,179
so nitrogen use efficiency has been

902
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:43,490
improving so it's possible that you know

903
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:46,429
for a while there was relaxed selection

904
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:49,789
and things have gone back to a stronger

905
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:51,618
selection I don't want to claim that

906
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:57,199
with only a couple of genotypes from

907
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:58,818
that that middle period but it it could

908
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,480
be interesting to look more closely at

909
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:04,159
those middle years and again these

910
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,260
changes in plant density that have

911
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,289
occurred alongside these changes in

912
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,990
fertility management may be maintaining

913
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:15,019
really strong intraspecific competition

914
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:17,449
for resources and therefore be providing

915
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:22,130
a stabilizing selection on some of these

916
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:25,429
rises for your traits alright so to

917
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,050
begin to wrap up and we saw that rises

918
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,000
for bacterial community composition was

919
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,730
linked with plant phylogeny and function

920
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,550
and this is exciting because it's a it

921
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,719
could be a potential tool for managing

922
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,700
rhizosphere communities and the

923
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:40,759
processes that they mediate in the field

924
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:43,689
and so if we can find different classes

925
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,690
of plants that are having

926
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:48,078
different impacts on the on the soil

927
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,440
environment we can incorporate those

928
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,920
into rotations we probably already are

929
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,740
and then influence the soil bacteria

930
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,088
bacteria community and the soil pools as

931
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:04,629
well so again do you know type effects

932
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:07,190
are evident in the data including within

933
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,710
the germ plasm from a commercial

934
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:15,650
breeding program but the mechanisms for

935
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:18,108
this are still a little unclear and

936
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,760
looking at the second experiment that I

937
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:21,619
showed with you this synchrony between

938
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,780
risers for your effects and nitrogen

939
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,880
uptake in the field I think is sort of a

940
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,390
foundation for understanding you know

941
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,099
where we might look for plant influences

942
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:36,019
on these processes and also the the

943
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:38,150
benefits of them and then finally the

944
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:40,280
breeding history at least modern hybrid

945
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,889
breeding has has maintained or enhanced

946
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,780
nitrogen uptake from soil pools while

947
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:47,078
leaving Rises for your assembly at least

948
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:52,640
amount that we can detect relatively

949
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:54,740
unchanged and so with that there's many

950
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,670
many people to acknowledge for this work

951
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:59,929
the towards sustainability foundation

952
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:02,480
actually give us our seed grant to get

953
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,699
our first project started and then the

954
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,608
usda hatch and the National Institute of

955
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:09,019
Food and Agriculture program provided

956
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:12,500
further funding to develop the work

957
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:15,039
further my committee Laurie Drinkwater

958
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,460
Margaret Smith Daniel Buckley had been

959
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,108
fantastic in supporting me less process

960
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,088
and I've learned an extreme amount from

961
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:25,130
them as well as the entire drink water

962
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:26,989
and Buckley labs you know you can't do

963
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:29,450
this work without your lab mates there's

964
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:33,199
a few that deserve particular mention

965
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:36,348
Heather Scott our research assistant in

966
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:39,889
the drink water lab was phenomenal help

967
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:41,180
in the fields she single-handedly must

968
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:44,568
have helped me salvage several

969
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:46,219
over-ambitious field projects Marisa

970
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,699
Weiss a former postdoc in the drink

971
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:51,709
water lab really trained me on the

972
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:54,469
biogeochemistry and the soil science

973
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,179
aspect of this nick Youngblood was a

974
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:58,009
postdoc working with Dan Buckley he's

975
00:41:56,179 --> 00:42:00,949
now with Ruth Ruth clay at the

976
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,570
Max Planck Institute providing the

977
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:05,719
training for the microbial community

978
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,070
analysis in the bioinformatics so

979
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:09,109
without them I could not have done it

980
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,480
thank you to the horticultural section

981
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,070
for the support for the environment that

982
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,079
he provided for the years that I was

983
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,500
here as well as the cornell

984
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,210
undergraduate biology program the for

985
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,679
their funding as well there's many many

986
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,490
other people that deserve recognition

987
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,569
but I can't list them all here so with

988
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:28,429
that I'd like to say thank you for

989
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:39,740
having me and I would love to take your

990
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:51,139
questions yes this Geneva have any

991
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:54,589
questions not here that's easy the

992
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:57,109
nitrogen application in the Eagle that

993
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,720
you showed me that most of the points

994
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,240
were right there the black ones are

995
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:05,509
really on the two lines what are the

996
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:08,629
open circles oh so this is an analysis

997
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,100
from this paper and I believe there were

998
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,990
some funny things that happen to this

999
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,539
year like droughts other things that

1000
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:18,109
artificially knocked down yields and so

1001
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:21,199
those are there indication that's not on

1002
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:25,900
the regression line Brian early in your

1003
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:27,219
talk you mentioned a correlation between

1004
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:31,309
rhizosphere

1005
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:33,439
population and the mainly in gut and I

1006
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:36,590
didn't understand that correlation at

1007
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,340
all sure so it gets back to this

1008
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,980
hypothesis of the organism evolutionary

1009
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,450
history influenced the the microbiome

1010
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:49,280
that that organism is selecting for and

1011
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:50,960
we had seen that in the PO AC and so

1012
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,640
Ruth ley did a study that was looking at

1013
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,530
the evolution of mammals and the

1014
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,679
phylogenetic relatedness of mammals and

1015
00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:00,380
the microbial community composition in

1016
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,969
their gut and what they found was that

1017
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,769
yes there was this relationship with

1018
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:06,289
evolutionary history and particularly

1019
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,949
once you controlled for food source or

1020
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:09,800
the

1021
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:10,969
the mammals diet then this relationship

1022
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,940
was much stronger

1023
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:20,719
so sort of informing our our current

1024
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:22,789
businesses Thomas C buckwheat in there

1025
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,639
and that is a plant that seems designed

1026
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:28,670
to support a huge microbial community

1027
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:32,059
briefly but yes perfectly designed for

1028
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:34,190
that but I couldn't tell without the

1029
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:37,279
waiting's weather that in fact those

1030
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:41,329
characters yes no buckwheat is an

1031
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,940
amazing plant and so early on one of the

1032
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:45,740
first slides I showed shows a sort of a

1033
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,740
picture of arises fear and that is

1034
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:52,039
actually buckwheat forms these great

1035
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:53,389
rise Oh sheets of so there must be some

1036
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,679
polymers that's releasing that are

1037
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:56,179
really just helping glue the soil

1038
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:59,269
together and foster a microbial

1039
00:44:56,179 --> 00:45:02,949
community I didn't show the data but

1040
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:06,409
it's enzyme activity is interesting and

1041
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:08,149
it doesn't fall out on that axis of the

1042
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:10,899
longer-lived higher nitrogen use

1043
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,980
efficiency plants it's on the other end

1044
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,880
but that's not to say that there's not

1045
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:45,199
interesting stuff happening on that end

1046
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:48,400
yeah it's a good one to study so sure so

1047
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:52,368
to build on some of the work that I

1048
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,730
presented here particularly the

1049
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:57,289
Actinobacteria story right so there's my

1050
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,568
hypothesis is that it has to do with

1051
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:03,199
plant you know carbon soil or

1052
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:04,519
rhizosphere carbon flow and

1053
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,069
and in some ways you know that's

1054
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:10,250
testable we can we can measure brute

1055
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:11,660
oxidation we can manipulate the

1056
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:15,440
environment the plants glowing and

1057
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:17,269
growing in to slow down growth there are

1058
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,608
some other alternative hypotheses I

1059
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:21,440
think about why octina bacteria might be

1060
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:23,029
selected for there's been some work

1061
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,889
showing that they thrive in the

1062
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,369
rhizosphere under drought conditions and

1063
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:29,929
so we could imagine that maybe the

1064
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,119
variation that we're attributing to

1065
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:34,519
differences in in rhizosphere carbon

1066
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,030
flow may actually have to do with these

1067
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,369
plants impact on soil moisture status in

1068
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:43,010
their eyes is fear but that again that

1069
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:44,930
that again is testable we can manipulate

1070
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,240
the water potential of the rhizosphere

1071
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:51,279
and test whether or not you know certain

1072
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:56,239
subsets of the community respond so

1073
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,990
perhaps a place to start time for one

1074
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,709
more question

1075
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:04,039
Tom Brian are there any implications for

1076
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:07,818
crop rotation from this you know a lot

1077
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:11,300
of things it's it's been de rigueur for

1078
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:15,259
a number of years but would you care to

1079
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:19,099
speculate on how rotational cycles might

1080
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:21,230
be informed by your data your findings

1081
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:23,660
sure thank you for that question it's a

1082
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:26,139
great question and one that I tried to

1083
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:30,588
allude to but maybe not clearly enough

1084
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:32,118
and so choosing the diversity of plants

1085
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:34,279
that we plant in our agricultural

1086
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,369
systems is really the primary one of the

1087
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:40,519
primary management tools that we have

1088
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:42,800
and rotations is is is a great one and

1089
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:44,750
so we choose rotations for a number of

1090
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,640
reasons you know we think of them often

1091
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,818
from a plant pathogen perspective we can

1092
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,690
break up the pathogen cycle I think I

1093
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:55,460
think this data suggests that the

1094
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,099
impacts on the broader microbial

1095
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,889
community may also be important you know

1096
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:03,559
so I wasn't testing pathogens but these

1097
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:05,539
different groups with microbes if

1098
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,068
they're having different impacts on the

1099
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:10,009
soil environment and I think there's

1100
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:14,050
reason to believe that they are from a

1101
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:16,780
soil conditioning perspective you know

1102
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:18,340
what you proceed or the the sequence in

1103
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,060
the rotation may have very important

1104
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:23,620
effects on the soil nutrient pools and

1105
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,699
the group of microbes that's there to

1106
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:30,369
take advantage of it in the next cycle

1107
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:33,129
which would seem to imply that a chronic

1108
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:35,409
monoculture maze is probably not

1109
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:39,519
beneficial to the rises here

1110
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:41,739
I think if if it's not broken up then we

1111
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:45,059
can probably make a strong inference

1112
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:49,559
that continuous maize cropping is not

1113
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:57,159
the most beneficial things for soil

1114
00:48:49,559 --> 00:49:00,909
thank you this has been a production of
