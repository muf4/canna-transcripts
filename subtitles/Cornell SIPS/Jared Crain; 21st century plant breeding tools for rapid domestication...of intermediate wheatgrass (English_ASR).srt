1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:15,058
I do want to acknowledge that like I'm

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,759
I'm getting to share the work today here

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:22,500
but there's a lot of other collaborators

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,060
uh pis that uh have helped bring this

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,518
work and it definitely doesn't happen

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,579
alone and so some of the people that

9
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:32,659
I'll mention today uh Dr Steve Larson is

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:36,359
a USDA research scientist at Logan Utah

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:39,000
uh Dr Jesse Poland started some of this

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,159
work when he was at Kansas State and is

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,878
still collaborative on it and then Dr

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,259
Lita Hahn is the uh breeder for the

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,238
intermediate wheatgrass at the land

16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,420
Institute so he does a lot of the the

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,359
Hands-On field work providing the data

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,899
that I get to analyze and work with and

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,899
show you today

20
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,659
um so the the talk for today just really

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,739
uh a four different parts provide a

22
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,780
little bit of introduction for

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,939
intermediate wheatgrass uh what it is

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,280
what we're trying to do and then we'll

25
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,099
spend most the time on the this breeding

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,439
uh for crop development looking at the

27
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,959
intermediate wheatgrass breeding cycle

28
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,139
and some of the the results we're seeing

29
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,239
and finally uh conclude kind of with

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,819
some population genetics what can you do

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,219
with the data and and where uh we're

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,658
trying to go in the future with some of

33
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,060
this work

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,640
so the the first thing and I know there

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,320
is actually research at Cornell within a

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,478
pyram intermediate but most the time

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,059
most audiences the the first thing is

38
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,340
just you know what is this plant it's

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,759
intermediate wheat grass so centiparum

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,840
intermedium the grain is being marketed

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,618
under the name kernsa uh so I usually

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
use uh iwg but if I say Kearns uh we're

43
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,118
talking about the the same thing the

44
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,359
grain there and it is a perennial plant

45
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,159
that we're looking at a

46
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,859
neo-domestication for ecosystem services

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,099
so things like reduced nitrate leaching

48
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,539
reduce soil erosion increased carbon

49
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,199
capture that you can do with these

50
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:19,199
perennial root systems compared to our

51
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,199
annual crops

52
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,359
and just looking a little bit at what do

53
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,179
you do with this grain uh some different

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,739
products Patagonia has released this

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,340
long root ale I know this one is on the

56
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,878
the West Coast I'm not sure if Patagonia

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,000
has released the an East Coast version

58
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,399
of this uh Cascadian farm so a

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,500
subsidiary of General Mills uh you know

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,219
one of the the largest cereal makers

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,239
released this uh limited edition serial

62
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:57,719
and then a lot of small scale breweries

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,878
bakeries are making products from

64
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,039
Pennsylvania there's Columbia County

65
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,359
bread and granola making these uh

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,579
sprouted Kerns a crisp or little chips

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,400
so there's a lot of different uh

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,760
utilization of the grain everything from

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,219
breads to Brewing uh

70
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,679
so looking at where all of this started

71
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,919
just to get a brief timeline in the

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,459
1980s a lot of this the ideas started at

73
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,579
Rodell Institute in Pennsylvania they

74
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,519
evaluated over 150 different perennial

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,280
species looking for uh what they thought

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,080
was the the main target that could be

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,500
more easily domesticated and

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,159
intermediate was the The Chosen species

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,939
uh in 2003 that work moved to the land

80
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,459
Institute with Lee De Haan and Lee

81
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:55,139
completed about six breeding Cycles from

82
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,959
2003 up to 2016 and in 2017 is is when

83
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,919
we started uh genomic selection up to

84
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,140
today uh going from cycle seven this

85
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,419
year right now we're in in breeding

86
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,000
cycle 14.

87
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,438
so when we look at breeding intermediate

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,180
wheatgrass

89
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,000
um you know the four big traits we look

90
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,100
at it's non-shattering free threshing

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,259
seeds

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,139
seed size or seed mass and then then

93
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,360
grain yield right now intermediates

94
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,840
about 10 percent of annual wheat so that

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,300
really needs to be increased to be a

96
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,478
viable crop for Farmers to to grow and

97
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,478
plant and and want to use as far as

98
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,659
breeding it is an outcrossing uh

99
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,279
heterozygous perennial the genome is a

100
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,220
little bit smaller than bread wheat but

101
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,159
it's still uh you know 12.6 GB so it's a

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,919
quite large and then it's also a

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,860
perennial as well

104
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,459
so before genomic selection the the

105
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,840
traditional phenotypic breeding cycle

106
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,779
would look a lot like this you would

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,719
take your parents in the spring you

108
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,859
could cross those and intermate those

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,139
you would get seed off your parent

110
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,520
plants that that fall you could start

111
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,519
seedlings

112
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,079
uh it would overwinter and then you know

113
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,839
the summer of year number two you would

114
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,240
collect phenotypic data you can take

115
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,519
that phenotypic data back analyze it go

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,978
figure out which plants you wanted to to

117
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,779
bring back in and make your next cycle

118
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,418
of selection with

119
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,679
so this takes um

120
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:33,959
at a minimum two full years per cycle

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,939
and the the one equation we'll really

122
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,339
look at today is just rate of genetic

123
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,600
gain we won't we're just going to look

124
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,899
at it uh

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,360
uh with with letters we're not going to

126
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,179
get into numbers or you know calculating

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,479
but just in general we know that rate of

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,639
genetic gain is the intensity of

129
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,839
selection

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,300
the accuracy

131
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,879
the genetic variation all divided by the

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,879
the time to complete the breeding Cycles

133
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,680
so in this uh example you know it takes

134
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,740
us two years to complete the breeding

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,418
cycle uh being a perennial plant maybe

136
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,660
we want to know how does that plant

137
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:15,538
respond in years two and three if we

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,280
were to do those evaluations then it

139
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,759
just adds more time to the breeding

140
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,719
cycle driving your your genetic gain

141
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,939
down and the first three Cycles at the

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,600
land Institute were were three years per

143
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:34,819
cycle so that's how from 2003 to 2016

144
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,819
there were only six cycles of selection

145
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,759
so I started this work uh really in 20

146
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,639
uh fall of 2016 looking at how do we

147
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,759
Implement genomic selection yeah that

148
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,139
was my my task as a as a postdoc is we

149
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,660
want to implement it how do we do this

150
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,759
this is kind of the the schematic we

151
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,860
came up with it looks a lot like your

152
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,680
your phenotypic selection starting out

153
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,199
you can cross your parents uh you get

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,478
seed seed off of those parents then in

155
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
the fall when you start those individual

156
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,818
seedlings

157
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,699
those get tissue sampled genotyped and

158
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,500
we can predict right away on those

159
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,120
seedlings that are only a couple weeks

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,160
old which ones we think are going to

161
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,259
have the the best trait values and we

162
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,060
start about 4 000 seedlings 100 are

163
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,740
selected each year for parents so you

164
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,959
can go in and grab those hundred that

165
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,379
you want for parents move them to the

166
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,180
greenhouse and right away they can be

167
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,918
intermated forming seed for the Next

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,918
Generation

169
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,939
now there is a a second component with

170
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,620
this so we can uh complete the breeding

171
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,918
cycle but we want our genomic selection

172
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,560
model uh to keep being updated so the

173
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:53,339
the second part is we take the the

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,098
non-selected plants we take those out in

175
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,318
the field they can be evaluated the the

176
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,560
second year the third year and all of

177
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,539
that data can go back into

178
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,699
forming the the predictions for the

179
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,399
following Cycles so our training

180
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,680
population is always uh at least one

181
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,598
cycle behind what we're actually

182
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,598
selecting

183
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:18,360
but following this scheme you can get

184
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,500
your uh reader's equation the rate of

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,240
genetic gain just down to the intensity

186
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,220
uh the selection accuracy and genetic

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,879
variance because we're down to one year

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,879
per cycle

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,099
um so so thinking about how this works

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,099
again just the the Breeders equation

191
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:42,300
those various components uh under

192
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,720
phenotypic selection uh we can we can

193
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,759
vary each part of this equation and one

194
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,720
area that we work on is selection

195
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,179
intensity under phenotypic selection uh

196
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,180
lee would plan out ten thousand plants

197
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:01,019
and then select the best hundred so

198
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:04,199
that's an I value of 2.65 under genomic

199
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,560
selection just based on cost constraints

200
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,240
we only genotype about 4 000 and we

201
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,739
still select about a hundred for the

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Next Generation so uh our I value is

203
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,299
2.38

204
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,839
so in this case when we look at genomic

205
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,819
selection to phenotypic selection the uh

206
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,060
we're at 0.87 so we're not actually

207
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,278
selecting as hard on the population with

208
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,500
genomic selection as we are under under

209
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,720
phenotypic selection

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,720
so that's selection intensity

211
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,519
and then our big gain is in selection

212
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,580
accuracy where we can complete that

213
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:44,339
breeding cycle in half the time

214
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,940
uh which should give us essentially

215
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,160
double the the yield of or double the

216
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,420
the gain compared to phenotypic

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,199
selection

218
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:57,000
so you can simulate this and all of

219
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
these different variables particularly

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,559
intensity and time that's the two things

221
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,199
that we can really manipulate with

222
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,119
genomic selection and we can put

223
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,820
together kind of a curve of where we

224
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,320
think uh we can end up for particular

225
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:16,260
traits so on this uh this figure the the

226
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,200
time axis that's the genomic selection

227
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:22,379
divided by the excuse me phenotypic

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,120
divided by genomic selection time so

229
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,278
from the last slide you know we were at

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,299
0.05 so we were at half the time of

231
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,299
phenotypic selection

232
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,299
excuse me y-axis is intensity and in

233
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,240
this particular case you know we were at

234
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,299
0.89 and then our relative efficiency or

235
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,079
relative gain of genomic selection to

236
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,838
phenotypic selection is is where uh we

237
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,899
are on this response surface

238
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,019
so using the the values

239
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:58,320
um from the last slide and this trait is

240
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,759
for just grain yield Spike yield our

241
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
selection intensity is a little bit

242
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,039
lower under genomic selection but we're

243
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,620
still doing that in half the time so we

244
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,740
should get to about a two and a half uh

245
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,919
time uh two and a half

246
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,360
relative efficiency gain using genomic

247
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,000
selection

248
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,339
and if you do look this response curve

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,679
actually doesn't set directly on this

250
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,959
line and that's coming from a little bit

251
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,299
of gain and accuracy I've used it just a

252
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,219
fixed variable but when we have our

253
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,278
genetic markers when we're making our

254
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,440
field adjustments we can actually make a

255
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,778
better prediction of that plot than we

256
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,779
could with pedigree records alone so

257
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:43,700
that's why we get a little bit coming

258
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,700
off of the the main line there

259
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,000
and you can do this with each trait

260
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,339
looking at different hair abilities and

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,278
this is uh basically what we put

262
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,980
together we thought for free threshing

263
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:59,539
we could get a relative gain of three

264
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,720
3.8 times our phenotypic selection

265
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:07,259
something that's highly heritable uh 6.6

266
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,860
and then Spike yield this is one of our

267
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,439
lower heritability traits everything's

268
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,778
is affecting Spike yield still get about

269
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,760
two and a half times the the relative

270
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,759
gain compared to phenotypic selection

271
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,958
it's all of that work that was kind of

272
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,079
the the setup to move toward genomic

273
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,000
selection uh we had a training

274
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,458
population that had been phenotyped and

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,740
genotyped all of the the slides before

276
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,859
that the data was built on those we knew

277
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,959
what our trade hair abilities were so

278
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,360
then we went to application and uh you

279
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,879
know how did we apply this and this is

280
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,419
just the the overview of of the breeding

281
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,899
cycle getting that uh entire cycle in

282
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,639
into one year uh and I usually think the

283
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,299
the breeding cycle starting in about

284
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,579
October and this is at the point that

285
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,458
we've selected those parents they're in

286
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:07,859
the greenhouse uh those seedlings are

287
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,439
growing bigger they're cloned so we have

288
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,459
multiple multiple ramets of each

289
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,339
individual Jeanette and by Jeanette I

290
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,199
mean a plant that is a single plant with

291
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,899
a genetic makeup so it's one single

292
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,540
heterozygous plant you could clone that

293
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:29,220
Jeanette into multiple ramets where each

294
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,219
ramet is the the same genotypically

295
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:36,419
so in the greenhouse these these ramets

296
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:39,539
uh they're cloned they're vernalized uh

297
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,399
then they're intermated uh the and then

298
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,278
around

299
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,379
April to may all of these breeding

300
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,820
populations you can thresh the seeds so

301
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,720
you've got the seed for the next cycle

302
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,120
so that's the the breeding cycle the

303
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,959
second part again is keeping that

304
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,720
training population updated uh at the

305
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,299
same time that the greenhouse work is

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,759
going on the validation or the training

307
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,859
population is out in the field so it's

308
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,439
being vernalized it's overwintering it's

309
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,620
growing and then uh in the summer

310
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,320
starting in May to July all of the

311
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,200
phenotypic data can be collected

312
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,320
and then the the final aspect what I

313
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,920
work on particularly is uh the genomic

314
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,899
selection and prediction which occurs uh

315
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,419
from about the first of August to the

316
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,399
the first of October and just zooming in

317
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,399
on that area

318
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,000
um so on the top you know we have August

319
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,980
at the far end October and these are the

320
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,559
the basic steps of the breeding program

321
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,800
everything that has to happen and I've

322
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:51,299
got the uh number of days approximately

323
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:53,759
that each one of these steps takes so at

324
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,679
the time that the the data is still

325
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,259
being recorded it's still being you know

326
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,379
compiled and checked this is going on

327
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,539
until mid-august uh the seedlings are

328
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:06,480
already started

329
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:09,059
once I get all of the data Lee to Han is

330
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,579
handling all of this data then it's a

331
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:14,278
pass off to me then we start running it

332
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:17,838
through our statistical models uh trying

333
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:20,879
to get the best prediction for our

334
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,459
as a training population to predict on

335
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,860
those new seedlings

336
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:29,578
tissue collection on about 4 000 plants

337
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:33,360
over a couple about a week and then we

338
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:35,239
have uh two weeks or so to do GBS

339
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,800
Library preparation

340
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,139
once those are sent off to a Sequencing

341
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,500
Center two to three weeks later we get

342
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,539
data back a lot of quality control check

343
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,198
in the data

344
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:51,120
and then once we call Snips impute the

345
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,719
data we're ready for the the genomic

346
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,820
prediction and this is uh I like to

347
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,320
describe it the genomic predictions

348
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,300
that's my one

349
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,519
one thing that I have to do each year

350
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,319
and it's only one day so I work one day

351
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,740
a year

352
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,778
uh now the the challenge is nothing can

353
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,579
go wrong that one day so I spend the

354
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:14,539
rest of the time making sure one day is

355
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:17,099
is perfect uh

356
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:20,278
once those predictions are made I pass

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,500
all that data back to Lee so you know at

358
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,379
the end and like I said it's a

359
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,480
collaborative effort I don't handle the

360
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,019
entire process I mean we have things

361
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,879
divided up with what we can do very well

362
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,759
and then he uses the breeder's eye and

363
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,259
and makes selection indices and selects

364
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
those plants that go into the the

365
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,600
greenhouse for mating and updating the

366
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
cycle

367
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,740
um when we started this we we did

368
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,980
publish this in the plant genome this is

369
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,379
the graph we published uh so tli cycle

370
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,159
six this was the last year of phenotypic

371
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:59,879
uh selection and then starting in 2017

372
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,578
we had cycle seven and this was

373
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:07,318
published in 2021 I've updated the

374
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:10,740
figure a little bit in 2023 we've got uh

375
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,199
the third year of data from cycle 10.

376
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,039
but I was like this is a little bit out

377
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,100
of date

378
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,000
uh this is today's breeding cycle so the

379
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,698
same

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,640
uh the same thing we saw on the last

381
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,679
slide but we've already got cycle 12 the

382
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,620
first year of data's just collected a

383
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,500
couple weeks ago and then starting this

384
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,599
year we've moved to a Rapid Cycling to

385
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,900
get two cycles per year so we're at

386
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,319
cycle 13 we completed that back in March

387
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,620
and we're working on Cycle 14 right now

388
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,379
so this has really allowed us to move

389
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,019
instead of discrete Generations cycle

390
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,539
six and then planting cycle seven for

391
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,859
one two or three years and then cycle

392
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:58,200
eight we can go through uh multiple

393
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,819
generations and we also have multiple

394
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,380
Generations they're never at the same

395
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:06,798
plant age but within one calendar year

396
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,140
were measuring

397
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:13,798
multiple Generations how that plants

398
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,299
responding so we we have hope that and

399
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,519
some evidence that we think this is

400
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:20,160
making our prediction models better that

401
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,980
we're doing better at incorporating all

402
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,100
the the G by E elements

403
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,400
so just I mentioned speed breeding uh

404
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:32,459
how are we doing that uh the just in the

405
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,880
greenhouse uh and then the timeline sets

406
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,600
up much the same way only the breeding

407
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,179
population it's really condensed that

408
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,759
under under red and far infrared light

409
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,160
we can grow these plants to get them to

410
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,558
tiller in about three weeks after

411
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,960
putting

412
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:55,500
a lot of red light on them

413
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,100
and so so we can start in October like

414
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,839
the normal breeding cycle by February uh

415
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,659
threshing seed

416
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,899
by mid-march the selections have been

417
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,798
made and now we're coming up on

418
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,798
completing that cycle again

419
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,660
and this is uh just

420
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,080
about 10 days ago so this is the land

421
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,538
Institute this is Cycle 14 the entire

422
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:25,859
breeding cycle that's been started and

423
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:29,700
genotyped there's Lee and suzzle stop it

424
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:31,619
is a postdoc with the land Institute at

425
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,779
the very end I'll share some of the work

426
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,939
that he's been leading and then this is

427
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,399
the the far red lights that we're

428
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,340
waiting once we get data back those

429
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,220
plants will go under right away

430
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,119
so the the two cycles per year this is

431
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,579
the

432
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,079
the proximate timeline we're following

433
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,480
that's our first year but it looks like

434
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,939
we're we're on track to to be able to do

435
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,099
this and at the same time that

436
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,960
Cycles are advancing in the greenhouse

437
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,819
we still have the the training

438
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,000
population growing in the field so

439
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,558
there's there's multiple moving Parts at

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,200
the same time

441
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:11,399
so the that was the the implementation

442
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,620
of genomic selection uh so the other

443
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,038
part of my job then is convincing the

444
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:19,759
breeder that what we're doing is working

445
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:22,259
and we've spent a lot of time looking at

446
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,179
different measures you know how can we

447
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,019
tell if our selections are working or

448
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,660
not

449
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:31,679
and you know one of the first things we

450
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:35,100
did was we had this predicted value on

451
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,320
the the seedling and then we have the

452
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,480
the training population about a thousand

453
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,359
plants that go to the field so we said

454
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,940
okay how well does this predicted value

455
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,939
actually measure the field data that was

456
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,298
measured seven eight months later and

457
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,000
this is free threshing so in cycle seven

458
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:57,960
uh on the x-axis is the predicted value

459
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,440
that we made in the fall of 2017 and

460
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,679
then the y-axis is the The observed

461
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,120
value from the field in 2018 so this is

462
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:12,360
year one I've got a correlation of 0.76

463
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:16,619
and multiple years so we this is the

464
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:18,719
same uh same cycle same plants we're

465
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,479
using the same predicted value that we

466
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,480
made but in year number two

467
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,298
so in 2019 so almost two full years

468
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,179
after we've made that prediction we

469
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:32,519
still get a very strong correlation so

470
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,860
this is free threshing uh we probably

471
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,599
have the better results for free

472
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,479
threshing shattering one of the lower

473
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,158
results is Spike yield so if we're

474
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,279
trying to increase yield a lot of

475
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,220
emphasis here the correlation is only

476
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:50,759
0.25 so in Year One

477
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:54,120
and then in in year two again using our

478
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,900
predicted value from 2017 and seeing how

479
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,119
it looked in 2019 a correlation of 0.21

480
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,679
which is is low but there's still a

481
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,639
trend there

482
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,679
another thing that we looked at then was

483
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,900
we had these hundred parents that we had

484
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,600
intermated that had been selected

485
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,298
ideally as you know the best individuals

486
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,219
to move that population parameters

487
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,900
forward

488
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,700
of the same generation a thousand of

489
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,259
those plants that were not selected as

490
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,880
parents went out to the field up there

491
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,700
training model but since it's a

492
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,960
perennial plant once these plants the

493
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,538
parents were intermitted in the

494
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,038
greenhouse they were still growing so

495
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:35,640
there was an idea okay let's put those

496
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,558
parents out beside the unselected of the

497
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,259
same generation

498
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,619
and so what you're seeing here is a

499
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,538
histogram of a free threshing so it's in

500
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:46,918
the at least the second year because the

501
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,140
first year those parents are in the

502
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,020
greenhouse then they've been planted

503
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,240
right beside the same field location

504
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,460
um there is some statistical issues the

505
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,319
parents aren't randomized you know

506
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,480
ideally the better parents are on the

507
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,099
edge

508
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,620
but for free threshing

509
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:06,000
if we make a histogram of the entire

510
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,058
population

511
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,839
that's the the black bars the mean of

512
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:15,000
the population is uh the the vertical

513
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,058
black bar but looking at this those

514
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,700
hundred parents those have been colored

515
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:23,579
in in purple the mean of the parent

516
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,220
population for free threshing uh ends up

517
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:28,558
being about 11 percent on a percentage

518
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,319
scale Higher free threshing than the

519
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,418
unselected individuals

520
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,000
and we can look at the the same traits

521
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,919
of Spike yield remember there wasn't a

522
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,859
strong correlation between predicted

523
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,860
value and observed but when we take

524
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,719
those parents out to the field again we

525
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,178
find that our parent plants are

526
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,620
outperforming the the unselected so just

527
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,559
giving some uh some data that we do feel

528
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,199
like our models are working so

529
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,779
confidence in what we're predicting

530
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,120
and looking at other traits so this this

531
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:05,700
is summarizing in a table the same type

532
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,979
of things we saw in that histogram so

533
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,259
we'll have the trait the the realized

534
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,720
selection differential how those parents

535
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:15,538
uh the mean value of the parents versus

536
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,159
the mean value of the population and

537
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,500
then using the heritability we can

538
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,980
estimate the expected response to

539
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,220
selection and percent genetic gain per

540
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,220
year

541
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,440
so for free threshing and this is one

542
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,720
that we we saw the histogram on the the

543
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,058
parents were about 11 percentage points

544
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,519
better than the unselected it ends up

545
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:42,480
being about a 14

546
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,759
per year genetic gain Spike yield the

547
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,759
parents were

548
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:50,158
0.11 grams better but we had a lower

549
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,558
heritability so our estimated or

550
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
expected response is only about 0.04

551
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,240
grams that still ends up being about

552
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,360
eight percent genetic gain per per year

553
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,579
for refreshing

554
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,798
so this is one of the the first things

555
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,619
we looked at and now we're up to

556
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,658
multiple Cycles we can look at the the

557
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,658
field data this isn't a common Garden

558
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:14,760
experiment but just looking at how those

559
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:19,200
Cycles individually are performing and

560
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:22,019
predicting uh the best The Blob for for

561
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,019
each individual sorting those into the

562
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,119
the cycle they came from

563
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:29,519
so on the x-axis we have the different

564
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,259
Cycles starting at cycle six all the way

565
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,379
to cycle 11.

566
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:37,980
and then the the distribution of those

567
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,200
individuals for Spike yield in grams we

568
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,940
see a nice Trend upward

569
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,460
which is a in this case across

570
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,500
five Cycles about seven percent uh per

571
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,319
year

572
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,919
and then uh we see the the big four

573
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,740
traits so we had uh Spike yield

574
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,259
and then this is a seed Mass

575
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,579
about three percent per year and I would

576
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,640
say this is the trait that's probably

577
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,859
had the least selection of the the four

578
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,159
important traits this had the least

579
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:15,479
selection emphasis uh on it percent free

580
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,919
threshing about 11 per year under the

581
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,460
last

582
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,380
two cycles I know that Lee has decreased

583
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,179
that selection intensity because we are

584
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,620
getting a lot of plants that are 90

585
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:31,620
percent pre-threshing uh so

586
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:34,678
changing uh Focus to to other variables

587
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:37,558
and then uh finally shattering uh less

588
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,720
shattering is is better so we see a nice

589
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,720
nice downward Trend across Cycles

590
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,778
so we've looked really at setting up the

591
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:52,139
genomic selection a pipeline and then

592
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:53,339
you know evaluating that pipeline the

593
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,419
last little bit that I want to talk

594
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:59,459
about is you know once we have a program

595
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,620
where everything is genotyped everything

596
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,960
is phenotyped and what all can we do

597
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:06,479
with that data

598
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,380
um and and one of the first things is uh

599
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,860
genome-wide Association studies

600
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:16,260
and the data I'll share is on tli Cycles

601
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,119
six through nine today if I were to go

602
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,500
do this I would have Cycles 6 through

603
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,778
13.

604
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,140
and it's about a thousand plants per

605
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:27,359
cycle and we're up to

606
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:32,100
well the the data I'll show is on about

607
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:33,778
4 000 plants today that database that

608
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:37,500
snowball keeps rolling we're up to about

609
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:40,319
8 000 phenotyped and genotyped plants

610
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:45,659
so all of the the data is there we can

611
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:49,439
go into a a g was very easily this is a

612
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:52,020
a Manhattan plot for seed shattering we

613
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,600
find you know some significant Peaks uh

614
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:59,579
2s and 4S interestingly the percent

615
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,939
variance explained by each one of these

616
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:05,278
Peaks are very small uh looking at those

617
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:09,000
four thousand plants I don't know if we

618
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:13,519
had a a giwas peak that explained more

619
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,519
than three percent of the variants

620
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,538
so since we have multiple breeding

621
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,400
Cycles then we can go back and say how

622
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,158
is this allele frequency changing so

623
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,019
this is a is a little bit more

624
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,080
validation that our GS is working as

625
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:30,658
well in this first box plot this is uh

626
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,778
for shattering on that 4S marker once we

627
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:37,260
ran the G was uh and then we estimated

628
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:39,659
the the allele effect very very additive

629
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:44,240
being heterozygous

630
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,240
I've yet to see a very strong

631
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:51,480
heterotic response most of our traits

632
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,839
respond very additively and this in this

633
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,099
case shattering higher shattering the

634
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,599
higher the score the higher the

635
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:01,019
shattering so we want to actually be low

636
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,418
here uh with this C and then we can put

637
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,839
together uh based on the the reference

638
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:09,480
genome how this allele frequency changed

639
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:13,439
in the population so we would like to

640
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,480
see more of the the snip C and then

641
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,480
starting in cycle six

642
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,538
uh the C is in the alternate it

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,200
increases uh you know from about 0.25

644
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:29,220
percent over uh 0.6 percent over those

645
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,140
three cycles and this was not uh this

646
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,079
was strictly based on the genomic

647
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,960
selection until we ran the G was I we

648
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,879
didn't know that this marker was

649
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,220
associated with shattering we weren't

650
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,640
selecting on it other than just being a

651
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,319
product of the of the genomic selection

652
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,200
model

653
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,379
another thing another trait brittle

654
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,058
racist we do find really strong Peaks on

655
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,960
3j

656
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:59,700
and this is a case I like to show all

657
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,579
the data again we see a very nice

658
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,038
additive allele effect where the lower

659
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:07,079
the score the less shattering and better

660
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,740
but when we look so we'd like to see

661
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,980
more of the the t-snip we actually see

662
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,919
that decreasing in the population

663
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:20,278
the only thing we can think of is that

664
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:24,240
this particular region has some linkage

665
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:27,778
drag or something that even with our GS

666
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,740
models we're we're not prioritizing that

667
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:30,740
particular snip

668
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,879
and I'd mentioned that our percent

669
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:39,659
variance explained was very small for

670
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,760
for all of our traits just using some uh

671
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,799
you know quantitative formulas you can

672
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,278
estimate the number of qtl that are

673
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:49,798
controlling things within

674
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,440
uh intermediate so we looked at brittle

675
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:55,500
rakis we should have been able to effect

676
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,380
to find a qtl at point that explained

677
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,980
0.9 percent of the variance

678
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,919
uh and based on that you know there's a

679
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,740
hundred maybe 166 qtl controlling

680
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,140
brittle rakers now this is very

681
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:15,120
interesting especially for the small

682
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:17,640
grains uh with barley the brittle rakis

683
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,459
is a very well studied system the btr1

684
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,600
the btr2 Gene and brittle rakis is

685
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,319
solved uh based on our our analytical

686
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:30,199
data we don't see that based on the

687
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:34,079
empirical data in the field

688
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,419
we don't have any main effect qtl we do

689
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:40,798
know that there are a lot of copy

690
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,600
numbers of this BTR Gene uh how they are

691
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,798
interacting how they are working not

692
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:49,379
really sure

693
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:51,058
is this number wrong absolutely but uh

694
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,860
it's

695
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:55,440
you know I don't know what the real

696
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:58,379
number will ever be but it's definitely

697
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,500
not a one or two or even a couple genes

698
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,020
system uh that is often associated with

699
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,500
brittle rakis in the small grains like

700
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,500
barley

701
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,240
so the and then the this slide

702
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,340
what I want to show with this is you

703
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,899
know we've got this big data set we've

704
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,599
got it stuff that's genotype we've got

705
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:21,298
phenotypes sometimes it's just asking

706
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,099
questions of the data this particular

707
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,220
data set

708
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:29,099
um The npgs germplasm Collection was

709
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,259
genotype so we had that and we have

710
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,719
pretty good historical records we know

711
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:37,319
the Kearns of breeding program since the

712
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,940
1980s but we don't know which pis and it

713
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,158
would have been the pis that were used

714
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,220
to start the program so we just said

715
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:49,080
okay what you know can we identify from

716
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,880
molecular data where the the founders of

717
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:54,359
the the current Kerns of breeding

718
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,799
population are and this is a a map just

719
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,379
of the

720
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:00,200
um you know Black Sea Caspian Sea and

721
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,220
then there's three different color codes

722
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,798
the orange circles are areas are pis

723
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,819
that molecular data predicted to be the

724
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:15,500
founder of kernsa and historical data uh

725
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:18,178
had documented as the founders of kernsa

726
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,700
and I will say the the historical data

727
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,259
is very clear that they selected 20 a

728
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,140
sessions for intermating

729
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,599
the problem is that's the end of the

730
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,538
historical records we don't have which

731
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:34,139
20th sessions so so we've recreated that

732
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:36,179
based on the data from 40 years ago uh

733
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,080
so we see a lot of overlap right here

734
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:42,538
the purple triangles are pis that

735
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,278
molecular data suggested was the

736
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,798
founders and then the the green

737
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:50,819
triangles or excuse me green Diamonds

738
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,558
Are a sessions that we estimated from

739
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:54,720
the historical record but overall

740
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,058
there's a lot of concurrence especially

741
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,120
right here in this Russia region between

742
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:02,460
the Black Sea and Caspian Sea I believe

743
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,699
it's the staff report I hope I said that

744
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:11,059
correct region that most of our Kern's

745
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,059
uh varieties uh come from from that area

746
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,039
and then the the last thing uh just the

747
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,659
future where where are we going with

748
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,960
some of this work what's the the next

749
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,059
big thing and this might I don't know if

750
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,559
if some of Jesse's talk last week might

751
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:29,000
have mentioned some of this but skim

752
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:31,679
sequencing High throughput uh Escape

753
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,559
sequencing what we're trying to do is

754
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,679
move our marker platform away from GBS

755
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,378
to uh something that will scale with the

756
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,179
new systems and also avoids any any

757
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:46,918
proprietary issues

758
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:51,599
so this was done uh Jesse was the

759
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:54,779
was the lead Pi on this using uh very

760
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,960
low skim sequencing so think .05 X

761
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,700
coverage to identify introgressions into

762
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,019
wheat

763
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,759
um

764
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,099
so that worked really well to

765
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,260
identifying aggressions when you look at

766
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,720
these two systems I just put this

767
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,960
together moving when you start thinking

768
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:16,679
about whole genome sequencing

769
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,838
most of the intermediates been on GBS

770
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,779
we get a thousand to two thousand

771
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:25,380
chromosome per markers 30 to 40 000

772
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,440
genome-wide with tassel pipeline very

773
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,000
easy to analyze the data we do have lots

774
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,280
of missing data so all of the

775
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,460
predictions that I showed were made with

776
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,200
up to 70 percent missing data per per

777
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,500
marker

778
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:43,679
uh with skim sequencing we've went from

779
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,940
a reduced representation to a whole

780
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:50,179
genome looking at 0.05 X coverage so

781
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,920
that gets us down to

782
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:55,980
an affordable level to sequence in the

783
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,320
breeding program and there are no

784
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,820
duplicate reads I mean most reads are a

785
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,400
single read but across populations we

786
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,400
can get three to four million variants

787
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,519
per chromosome so we went from working

788
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,099
on 40 000 markers up to like 80 million

789
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,679
and I put this together I didn't know

790
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,260
how else to say it I mean right now it's

791
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,358
a

792
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,760
different set of software you know one

793
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,578
piece for filtering one piece for doing

794
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,339
the next analysis and pipelining all

795
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,820
that together and then I would say we've

796
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:34,500
got even more missing data than GBS if

797
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,838
we thought we had a lot of missing data

798
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,940
under that

799
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,519
so in the last couple of weeks and

800
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,800
social staff at the the postdoc at the

801
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,599
land Institute has been working on a lot

802
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,240
of this he's really helped move this

803
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,619
forward uh the last couple of weeks I

804
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,679
feel like we've kind of had a

805
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,260
breakthrough on on moving toward this

806
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,598
method and I just want to show so this

807
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,780
is a a g was Peak

808
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:05,519
or excuse me Manhattan plot or brittle

809
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,200
rakis on that chromosome 3G 3j using GBS

810
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,219
markers

811
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:14,299
and we had about 2 000 markers uh here

812
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:19,078
and we have really good Peaks uh around

813
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:21,660
120 million base pairs uh 160 and those

814
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,300
correspond we do know that the BTR genes

815
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:27,480
are right in those areas

816
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,460
so taking the the skim seek data just

817
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,519
that alone

818
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:35,820
.05x coverage uh this is a another

819
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,800
analysis of brittle rakis

820
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,640
we actually start to see really good

821
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:44,780
Peaks that are lining up with our GBS

822
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:48,779
markers and maybe even a little bit

823
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:55,140
cleaner resolution throughout and all of

824
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:58,380
these areas this is the 120 160 280. we

825
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:02,338
have found through G was GBS markers in

826
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,480
in those spots so this is uh really

827
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:08,279
promising that uh I think that we can

828
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,460
make this work as a way forward for

829
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,160
affordable sequencing and we'll have a

830
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,159
lot more data for for different

831
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,159
analysis

832
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,099
so just in in summary uh with genomic

833
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,380
selection we can really decrease our

834
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,420
cycle time

835
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,820
in intermediate wheatgrass all of our

836
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,639
traits are really polygenic we don't see

837
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,700
any major effect qtls

838
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,279
and using all that data we can do a lot

839
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,559
of different analysis even analysis that

840
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,359
we don't start out to do we've just got

841
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,599
a huge data set that a lot of times we

842
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:48,420
can answer a question if if we parse it

843
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,180
correctly and then finally uh

844
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,639
breeding programs just require teams of

845
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:57,259
expertise my part's been the

846
00:38:53,639 --> 00:39:00,960
bioinformatics the data management

847
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,780
and a lot of the the phenotypic datas

848
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,019
came from from lead on

849
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,519
and with that again I'd like to thank a

850
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:10,858
lot of fundings came from the land

851
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:16,259
Institute Malone family land

852
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:18,000
preservation foundation in the ffar

853
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,780
program as well

854
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,059
and it's I'm sure I've missed people but

855
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,500
it takes a lot of people to be able to

856
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,279
present that and I want to acknowledge

857
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,280
all of their work

858
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,019
uh what's correlation they Spike yield

859
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,880
and yield for unit area

860
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,139
also would you look at inbreeding

861
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,599
pressure

862
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:42,299
okay so the the question is correlation

863
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,320
between Spike yield like on a single

864
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:48,480
plant and what would be more like a plot

865
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,760
what a farmer would Harvest

866
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,599
I think those are pretty good Lee had

867
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,119
did a lot of work on this

868
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,519
2005 2010 looking at single plants

869
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,320
versus plots and that's why he initially

870
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,259
started with

871
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,700
um you know single plants why work we

872
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,420
are moving

873
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:09,118
um

874
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,940
to a lot more half sib family evaluation

875
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,338
so full plots we've you know kind of

876
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,920
tweaked what I've shown there to where

877
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:19,380
now we can plant a a full half sib

878
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,480
family and that's actually

879
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,480
probably in the future going to be more

880
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,219
informative in our GS models than the

881
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,440
single plant work

882
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:30,000
and I don't really have exact numbers

883
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,500
but I know every time I've heard Lee

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,780
talk about it he says the correlation

885
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,460
was high enough that he felt comfortable

886
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,460
going to single plants

887
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:41,159
perfect

888
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,519
yeah

889
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:45,598
we have not estimated particularly I I

890
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,539
know

891
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,119
you can tell that the later Cycles are

892
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,099
more inbred uh

893
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,420
when we make our genomic relationship

894
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:58,680
Matrix I don't have a value but across

895
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,039
25

896
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,019
000 markers and five or six Generations

897
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,539
only

898
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:08,039
less than 300 have been fixed in the

899
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:10,389
population

900
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,519
so

901
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:13,519
[Music]

902
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,400
I'll be the most other crops they have

903
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,920
integral prediction possible place as

904
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,800
that even tossed around to estimate

905
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,539
values on stuff made it on the pis or

906
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,900
from other obsessions whereas that seem

907
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,900
to cut out

908
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,179
so so since we have the

909
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,380
the the blobs or the predicted values on

910
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:45,019
intermediate have we tried to

911
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,019
predict back to what's in grin or

912
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,779
oh

913
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,839
we we've looked a lot of the wild

914
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,500
assessions

915
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:01,078
um

916
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:04,320
you know there's about 400 total in npgs

917
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,780
I know occasionally and it's been a

918
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,920
couple years Lee will bring in some new

919
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:13,079
material uh but right now we've had

920
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,400
enough genetic diversity there's still a

921
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,260
ton of diversity that we really haven't

922
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,619
pulled stuff in but we have evaluated

923
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,320
some in like the npgs collection there's

924
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,720
definitely different groups

925
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,260
because intermediate wheatgrass was bred

926
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:34,078
also prior to this as a forage erosion

927
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,200
control crop so there's differences in

928
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,079
you know biomass production versus seed

929
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,879
production even within that

930
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,180
the

931
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,059
so the the selected parents then do go

932
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:50,219
back to the field

933
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:53,460
I haven't really used them because

934
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,959
there's they're actually cloned I mean I

935
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,240
do a lot of checks like the the

936
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,960
histograms I was showing you and we do

937
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:03,539
see that a lot uh that the parents are

938
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,960
usually performing better in the way we

939
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:09,900
want but with the clonal data I haven't

940
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,880
used that particularly in the malls I

941
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,420
think there's a chance that could change

942
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,660
we do a spatial correction with ar1 by

943
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:22,260
ar-1 and I know for like grain yield

944
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:24,480
if we stack all of the parents on the

945
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,579
side instead of being randomly allocated

946
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,960
you know where we're going to buy us our

947
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,359
model too

948
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,880
so I don't

949
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:36,900
the

950
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,180
that I mean the the selected parents

951
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,240
if nothing else you know the following

952
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:44,219
cycle a thousand plants are going to go

953
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:48,358
into the field which should capture

954
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:49,858
everything there so we could be losing a

955
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,159
little bit but we're going to be picking

956
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:52,159
it up

957
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,818
in the next cycle anyway

958
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:03,960
so how many cycles of selection and

959
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:03,959
depends on where the the end goal is uh

960
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,519
or a product that farmers could grow I

961
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,358
mean you know there's the University of

962
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,380
Minnesota has released a variety

963
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:18,598
and I think they're coming out with

964
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,140
their second release

965
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,480
if you look at targeting saying annual

966
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,900
wheat uh

967
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:33,059
yield so equivalent yield whether you

968
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:37,200
grew the perennial or annual I think the

969
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:40,880
um the last estimates we were at were

970
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,029
about 20 years of 40 Cycles

971
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,660
but that also

972
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,920
[Music]

973
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:49,379
assumes that the rate of genetic gain is

974
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,180
going to be constant every year that we

975
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,358
don't uh

976
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:57,179
get to inbred or or lose too much

977
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,000
diversity as well which at this point we

978
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:03,539
haven't seen But predicting out 20 years

979
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,539
is challenging

980
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,740
yeah so so our our genomic selection is

981
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:14,159
working but our G was is you know less

982
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:16,858
than optimal uh

983
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:19,679
really the only thing we know is is we

984
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:22,019
think most traits are just highly highly

985
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,299
polygenic that

986
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,000
we're looking at very small trade

987
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,720
effects where our our GS model just

988
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,280
captures all of that and isn't trying to

989
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:37,679
test for significance of a single marker

990
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,480
oh

991
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:43,139
yeah

992
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,380
yeah so so the the G wasp was about 4

993
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:49,199
000 plants so it was the the training

994
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,240
population across

995
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:56,939
five cycles of selection

996
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:58,979
so data representing about six or seven

997
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,099
calendar years

998
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,858
and it was pooled uh so multiple years

999
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:07,920
of observation in in the model and then

1000
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:11,460
one uh blah per

1001
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,338
Janet per per plant so each each plant

1002
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,220
was kept genotyped separately and had

1003
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,420
its unique uh predicted blop that went

1004
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:22,078
in the model

1005
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:24,720
so we had about 4 000 plants go in uh

1006
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,880
and then those blobs

1007
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:32,358
depending on the cycle would have either

1008
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,358
had one up to four years of observations

1009
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,599
uh

1010
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:39,780
so

1011
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,619
we do know the the maternal plant and

1012
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,560
then

1013
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:46,380
that 100 selected the the breeding

1014
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,318
program is the the pots are growing in

1015
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,059
the greenhouse turn the fans on and blow

1016
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,159
a big pollen cloud of those hundred

1017
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:56,219
plants shuffle them around so we don't

1018
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:59,279
do any targeted crosses but then we also

1019
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:02,818
using the GBS markers we can assign

1020
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,880
eternity so we do track the pedigree and

1021
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:08,219
I know selections we try to keep you

1022
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,640
know too many of the the same family or

1023
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:13,858
maternal line we haven't you know

1024
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,679
optimal contribution we haven't went

1025
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:20,460
there but we do try to

1026
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:22,139
uh at least at a baseline level keep

1027
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,019
everything from coming from one family

1028
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:27,900
and I know Lee has said before so this

1029
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:29,759
was tli cycle six and before you know he

1030
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:34,559
was using basically pedigree meat

1031
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,660
pedigree breeding and a lot of times the

1032
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,460
the top lines would all come out of the

1033
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:39,118
same family

1034
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,159
um

1035
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,720
so we we do with the markers we do get

1036
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,719
better resolution than that

1037
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:51,358
um

1038
00:47:46,818 --> 00:47:54,239
the cost wise as far as the genotyping

1039
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:57,598
say genomic selection prediction per

1040
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:01,618
sample is about

1041
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:06,599
probably totaled ten dollars or less

1042
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:11,880
per per plant yes and we're genotyping

1043
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:13,920
4 000 to 4 400 plants so it's

1044
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,300
forty to fifty thousand dollars per

1045
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,300
cycle

1046
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,859
just for the the genomic side that's not

1047
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,579
counting the

1048
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:26,299
the labor and and the greenhouse you

1049
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:26,300
know work as well

1050
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,640
uh

1051
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,640
yeah

1052
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,280
no I'll stay away from that question no

1053
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:41,219
uh yeah I don't

1054
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,319
total cost yeah

1055
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:47,879
would be very challenging and

1056
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:48,960
intermediate also you know this it

1057
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,240
started

1058
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,519
the the identification of intermediate

1059
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:56,159
it started Leaps and Bounds ahead of

1060
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,980
many wild species I mean The rodel

1061
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,559
Institute evaluated

1062
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:04,858
150 different species and they selected

1063
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:07,078
intermediate as you know the the one

1064
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:10,139
that was closest

1065
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,700
to to being able to domesticate or I say

1066
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:14,098
closest you could also think maybe the

1067
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:17,699
easiest if we fix a few things and it

1068
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,359
already has a flavor profile and

1069
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:21,719
um

1070
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:24,299
so it's also going to depend on where

1071
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,519
that species is starting how many things

1072
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,760
do you have to fix you know

1073
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:31,400
interestingly in like the the npgs's

1074
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,960
sessions

1075
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,680
and the ones that were coming out of the

1076
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,079
that Russia region some of those are

1077
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,139
marked down as cultivar

1078
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,079
or as a cultivated species they're not

1079
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:48,659
wild that they were planted no we don't

1080
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,180
have any more records than that exactly

1081
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:53,460
what that means but

1082
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:55,379
you know whether there was been humor

1083
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,900
human intervention in the past I don't

1084
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:01,440
know but it's I would say intermediate

1085
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,599
started closer to a crop than than some

1086
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,300
of the other species that have been

1087
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,280
evaluated and worked on

1088
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,700
so you're contemplating changing Market

1089
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:15,119
platforms right for DPS to to sequencing

1090
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:16,559
how are you planning on so you're gonna

1091
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,440
have to sort of Disconnect between your

1092
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:23,279
historical data and speed data doing

1093
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,500
markification or what yeah so the the

1094
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,200
last slide I showed where the the G was

1095
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,318
is starting to look good

1096
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:34,019
um that was the you know the first

1097
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:37,619
hurdle was making sure that we thought

1098
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:39,719
our imputations were good and

1099
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,940
ideally we had planned on this cycle

1100
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,618
being to skim seek but that is that is

1101
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,980
the hurdle is

1102
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:49,800
for that previous training population

1103
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:52,559
six Generations imputing those GBS

1104
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,700
markers I mean basically a whole genome

1105
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,140
imputation just using those markers

1106
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:00,299
so that's still

1107
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,639
that's still the work in progress that's

1108
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,880
been kind of our hold up in in moving

1109
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,879
forward

1110
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:15,739
that's yes that's that's the plan I

1111
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,318
don't know how it will work in practice

1112
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:22,439
I I do know uh you know like uh Steve

1113
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,239
Larson his group is breeding stuff and

1114
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,059
you know he's actually starting his

1115
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,679
first cycles of selection so he's

1116
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,019
starting with like a fresh white board

1117
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,779
and you know what I showed with skim

1118
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:38,519
seat there is all he needs because he's

1119
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:41,160
starting with that and he's off to go

1120
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,900
changing platforms is yeah it's it's a

1121
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,719
challenge for

1122
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:48,079
for any program but for this especially

1123
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:48,078
you know

1124
00:51:53,639 --> 00:52:01,558
this has been a production of Cornell
