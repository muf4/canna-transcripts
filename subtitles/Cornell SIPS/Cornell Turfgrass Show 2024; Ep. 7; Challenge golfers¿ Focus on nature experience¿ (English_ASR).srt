1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,480
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,439
University all right uh welcome

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,880
everybody it's PGA Championship week

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,440
this is the week we were probably

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,240
beginning to chat about Michael Black

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,599
last week when he was last year when he

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,719
was at oakill in fact I was at Craig

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,039
burn uh golf club yesterday uh outside

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,799
outside of e aora in New York an

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,800
absolutely beautiful track I'll talk

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,480
about that in a minute um but in you

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,359
know a lot of people were like this time

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,439
last year we were we were excited about

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,520
the PGA and for those who don't know I

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,399
think Jeff corkran has moved on from

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,079
that position at the superintendent at

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,558
oakill and now has a uh Consulting

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,960
business with the superintendent at uh

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:45,679
former superintendent Oakmont so uh

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,399
we're looking forward to some good golf

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,479
uh the drama ensues uh you know all they

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,320
talk about is the baloney until the golf

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,519
starts and thankfully today they'll just

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
start talking about the golf um but I

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,120
know Carl's gotten something to say

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,119
about this I'm I'm never uh I'm a sucker

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,718
for a good dog picture being a dog

28
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,039
person myself uh whenever you can get

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,920
the dogs to help out with enhancing your

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,159
green speed or just the love they have a

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,759
laying around the grass always makes me

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,000
happy to see it and as I mentioned yes

33
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,000
as I mentioned yesterday I was with the

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,040
golf course superintendent Association

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,040
of New York Joe Lucas uh the president

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,600
was there Rick hfor uh board member Ron

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,960
stepanic uh the executive director was a

38
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:35,000
really well attended uh maybe maybe 17

39
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,199
20 folks there um walking around a

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,478
beautiful Robert Trent Jones Senior Golf

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,799
Course Carl uh really uh sort of very

42
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,200
interesting and and and is about to go

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,520
through some uh greens extension and a

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,680
bunker redo and um so uh much like we're

45
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,078
doing and and he's uh one of the things

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,719
that was really cool is he's got a uh a

47
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:03,118
POA Nursery uh started about half an

48
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:05,759
acre of POA sad that he'll be producing

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,879
that's needed for August of

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,800
25 I think one of the things that's

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,878
interesting Terrence mentioned yesterday

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,760
in the conversation was that you know he

53
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,120
they started planning for this last year

54
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,280
and it's been almost a two-year process

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,680
to get a contractor and architect and

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,479
people available to do the work so Tyler

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Ray will be doing the uh renovation uh

58
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,079
at at craigburn I will say Carl real

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,879
diamond in the rough I actually didn't

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,200
even know this place until I got out

61
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,000
there and and one of the topics that uh

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,039
came up yesterday which is really

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,280
fascinating and I know one that we've

64
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,120
begun to discuss um he's got about 45

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,039
Acres of High Grass uh fine Fescue uh

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,319
monocultures essentially he's been

67
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,639
establishing monocultures out there for

68
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,958
a number of years and he'll be making a

69
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,279
drone application of herbicides uh to

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,158
that landscape so uh Terren really on

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,439
the Progressive edge of managing these

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,158
things because obviously you can't drive

73
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,759
through them uh when you are um you know

74
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,598
growing them High the way they're trying

75
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,518
to do he only mows them once a year and

76
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,798
I know we've talked about managing the

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,400
high grass this way at Beth Page but

78
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,599
Carl since it's golf this week you are

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
our resident offici andado of these

80
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,598
things and of course your name was

81
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,039
brought up many times yesterday as the

82
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,318
former Champion the midam champion we

83
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,919
were throwing that around uh yesterday

84
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,119
among the crew I don't think you played

85
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,958
out at when it was at Craig burn that

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
year so why don't you talk to us a

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
little bit about what's going to happen

88
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,679
at Valhalla I'm sure you've got

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,239
something to say about this particular

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,560
golf course yeah so you know every time

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,158
there's a major championship Frank

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,840
people talk about the golf course and

93
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,039
they spend Monday through Wednesday

94
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,039
talking about what's the golf course

95
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,199
gonna be like uh and we mentioned

96
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,039
Architects already and Robert Chen Jones

97
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,158
senior was there at Craig burn which

98
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,840
which there's a lot of players at

99
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,359
craigburn they host a lot of New York

100
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,840
State Golf Association championships uh

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
but there's certain crowd of golf

102
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,640
architecture folks who really like

103
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,318
Golden Age architecture and firm and

104
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,318
fast and really wide Fairways and uh

105
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,598
they call that strategic architecture so

106
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,479
there's penal that would be sort of an

107
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,798
rtj um classification heroic and some

108
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,918
could argue rtj invented heroic Golf

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,959
Course architecture and then strategic

110
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,478
and people like Friday golf uh this is

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,360
sort of a media Outlet who talks about

112
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,159
golf architecture they like the

113
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,120
Strategic Golden Age architecture

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
courses so this week at valala is not

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,720
one of those it's a Jack Nicholas uh and

116
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,918
they had this tweet the other day that

117
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,560
that just sort of rubbed me the wrong

118
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,519
way they said it oh uh Valhalla doesn't

119
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,800
provide a thought-provoking test nor

120
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,159
does it take full advantage of its

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,360
property the design falls short I wasn't

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,919
able to read the articles it's behind a

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
pay wall but you know some of that stuff

124
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,519
Frank and and I get why people like

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
certain you know designs more than

126
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,120
others but when you start saying golf

127
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,159
doesn't provide a thought-provoking test

128
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm thinking man golf is there's a lot

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,080
of thought that goes into golf and I

130
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,680
thought about this famous interview that

131
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,120
Phil m does with David farity and people

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,759
will remember it it's iconic because

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
Phil's got all black on and he's got

134
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,080
this leather black jacket so he's a real

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
sort of cool slickback hair look far

136
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,240
asks him you know what do you think

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,319
about in a golf shot and then Phil

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,360
rattles off for five straight minutes

139
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,599
uninterrupted every single thing he

140
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
thinks about when he's about to hit a

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,879
golf shot he's talking about the

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,759
temperature outside the altitude you're

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,519
playing at what time of day is it in the

144
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,038
morning is it in the afternoon the ball

145
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,038
goes four five yards shorter in the

146
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,759
morning where's the wind you know what's

147
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,560
the LIE looking like what height is the

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,160
grass where where the grain of the grass

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,038
facing distance pin location slope

150
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,080
geometry of the green and and where

151
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,759
bunkers and water and so he's going on

152
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,120
and on and you're like oh my God this

153
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,560
goes into every single shot you hit and

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
he's like yeah I just I have to process

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,000
all these things uh and when you list

156
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,680
these things out Frank eight of those 11

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,199
have nothing to do with the golf course

158
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,400
architecture and we think about

159
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,240
thought-provoking you could be in a flat

160
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,638
field with a circular green putting a 15

161
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,519
handicap on there they got to still

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,918
consider eight of these 11 things when

163
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,478
they're playing golf I'm I'm like you

164
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,639
know we we often especially we're

165
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,240
talking about golf architecture we're

166
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,400
talking about challenging a player or

167
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,079
making them think and I'm just like you

168
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,719
know golf is it's too hard right we're

169
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,839
provoke we're literally provoking

170
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,800
golfers to the point where they're

171
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,560
taking divots and thad's greens out

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,759
there in Terry Hills where there're

173
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,199
snapping clubs I'm just sort of like you

174
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,720
know the emphasis on how you play a golf

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,520
course and how you score is I guess one

176
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,240
thing you can analyze at at a pro level

177
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,159
for a PGA Championship or something like

178
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,478
that but just for the everyday Golf

179
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,960
Course uh it'd be nice if we s thought a

180
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,639
little bit beyond you know what you're

181
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,478
shooting on a golf course and some of

182
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,038
the other benefits we get just as a

183
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,359
recreational activity right the majority

184
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:44,038
of golfers are out there just to have a

185
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
good time for four hours and I wrote

186
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,800
about this this is sort of a Shameless

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,280
plug for um an article I wrote in the

188
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,079
recent uh gcsy newsletter but I talk

189
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,918
about you know there's all these other

190
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,598
positive aspects to golf that that have

191
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,198
nothing to do with your score and things

192
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,639
like physically walking around for four

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,240
hours how many calories you burn if you

194
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,918
do that routinely you get these positive

195
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Health outcomes over your your lifespan

196
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,799
right uh social cohesion learning how to

197
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,360
be with with strangers or your friends

198
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,038
for four hours talking to people uh and

199
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,520
then you know sort of the summary of the

200
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,560
article is uh when we study Urban green

201
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,120
spaces and how Parks makes us feel when

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
we can get out for a 10 minute or 15

203
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,079
minute walk in a park we we measures

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,038
people you know their anxiety their

205
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,318
stress levels and they always go down

206
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,959
that's a really good thing hey 10

207
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,720
minutes 15 minutes in Green Space is

208
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,560
really good for for your s of mental

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
well-being so golf is the same thing you

210
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,240
get to do it for four hours surely when

211
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,199
people come off a golf course they

212
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,120
should be less stressed and have less

213
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,840
anxiety and it turns out that's not

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,439
always the case and a couple of folks

215
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,959
who studied this Parker Anderson has a

216
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,199
thesis on this from uh from his graduate

217
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,918
work is now they don't come off with

218
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,478
less stress and oftentimes they come out

219
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,198
with more stress and anxiety it's

220
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,758
because they're focusing on on their

221
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,439
score and their performance so just what

222
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,080
I wrapping this up today is you know

223
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,120
it'd be nice if we could get our golfers

224
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,120
to think a little bit more about

225
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,720
sort of being out there in a natural

226
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,000
environment looking at things taking in

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,080
that uh that beautiful landscape the

228
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,560
grass the trees the animals that around

229
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,719
and as a superintendent or Steward of

230
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
the property maybe you can sort of cue

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
your golfers because because they're

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,839
going to forget they're not going to

233
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
think about those when when they're left

234
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,359
to their own devices right they're

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,279
looking at the ground where's their ball

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,240
going if you have some signage or

237
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,478
something maybe you can say hey here's a

238
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,960
cool Vista look out at this you know

239
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,519
mountain in the background that's X

240
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,878
Mountain or hey look at this tree this

241
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,879
is this is tree in our region trying to

242
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,158
cue golfers to like you know this is a

243
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,240
natural landscape just like a lawn is or

244
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,639
a sports field or a park or Cemetery uh

245
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,200
trying to get people to think a little

246
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,759
bit more about just the golf score so

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,680
that's a that's my rant it's funny yeah

248
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
it's funny Carl because when I hear you

249
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,559
talk I remember the podcast I did with

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Parker Anderson who who did that study

251
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,239
in Michigan who said basically golfers

252
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,639
barely know they're outside y they're so

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,560
emphas I mean when you when I read that

254
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,759
thing that you sent over and like

255
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,958
thought-provoking you're exactly right

256
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,319
I'm overthinking a threefoot gimme I I

257
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,958
don't I I think I understand what they

258
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,879
mean and of course you know and I know

259
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,119
there's a whole culture of I don't want

260
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,480
to call them golf snobs but it certainly

261
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,919
is this sort of

262
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,399
intellectual uh approach to looking at a

263
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
golf course um and and I you know I

264
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,879
almost think you're exactly right

265
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,958
usually the problem is we're we're over

266
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,519
we're overthinking it but to your point

267
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:39,599
I think we feed this right especially

268
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,440
those in this business I I think golf

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,600
superintendant at rightfully so uh I

270
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,959
mean I met craigburn this is like the

271
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Hazel team of of Western New York it's

272
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,799
all scratch golfers they they don't they

273
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,720
play 10 12,000 rounds a year and you

274
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,719
know it's all about the score and the

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,040
betting and the this and I'm I'm not

276
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,278
suggesting that any of those things

277
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,399
happen but we know they do

278
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,039
and and I think the superintendent then

279
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,000
gets sucked into I got to produce the

280
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,039
golf course you know for those people

281
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
because they barely I got to remind them

282
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,958
to look at the view because they're not

283
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,799
even going to look uh when they're

284
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,559
playing so I do think you know there's

285
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,838
that there's a part of the business that

286
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,359
you know we we respond to but at the end

287
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,120
of the day Carl they're the loudest

288
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,120
voices kid they're the ones screaming oh

289
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,320
the greens are slow I mean I'd be I'd

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,919
love to see a superintendent when some

291
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,760
somebody comes up say oh you know the

292
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,719
greens you know don't feel so good today

293
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,838
I know but isn't that view over the lake

294
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,320
really beautiful that says no golf

295
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,079
superintendent so I do think we have to

296
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,680
have a balance for these things but

297
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,799
you're exactly right the sort of the

298
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,199
sort of public conversation that goes

299
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,559
around around golf sometimes especially

300
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,519
for architectural stuff uh just

301
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,239
completely eludes me and I'm really glad

302
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,759
for you as a you know a really good

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,120
golfer saying hey we we should enjoy

304
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,799
this being out there and I know part of

305
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,399
that's coming from you don't get out get

306
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,639
to get out as much now being a parent

307
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,440
every time you're out there being

308
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,240
outside with the kid and the dog uh is

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,800
good and you're not as fussed about your

310
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,959
score uh as you used to be but you can

311
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,278
remember the day when score was all that

312
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,958
matter yeah yep it gave me a lot of

313
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,679
stress and anxiety but at the same time

314
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,399
now that I've learned you know and when

315
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,319
I look at the data too the Frank it's

316
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,278
like man yeah maybe I should just sort

317
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,480
of enjoy being out there and I bet

318
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,838
people will have lower scores if they

319
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,680
just sort of relax hey man it's just

320
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,880
it's not unheard of either car right I

321
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,919
mean when I was uh at the US Open in

322
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,480
2018 going around shinok I had I was

323
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,278
partnered with the superintendent at

324
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,278
Sergio Garcia's golf course in Spain

325
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,759
right Sergio Garcia think of him what

326
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,000
you want but he's an enormously gifted

327
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,519
talented golfer I mean he maybe didn't

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
win as much as everybody thought the kid

329
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,679
goes to the golf course for like a half

330
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,040
an hour with his father gets a little

331
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,799
waggle hits a few balls putts a few

332
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,439
balls and he's done he he's a feeli guy

333
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,599
right Carl there's guys that want to

334
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,240
grind and then you also hear Scotty

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,639
sheffler I used to go out for two hours

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
after the round and now I'm like yeah

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,919
I'm all right I can figure this out I

338
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,239
think even at the highest level you hear

339
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:25,879
this back and forth about managing the

340
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,839
stress that you put on yourself to be

341
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,120
exceptional at a game that you're going

342
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,760
to shoot in I mean Woods shoots an Aiden

343
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
yeah on a given day right and probably

344
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,799
not even what some people would even

345
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,360
think a very hard golf course but but I

346
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,599
I do think um there is something about

347
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,039
golf coures golf course people and

348
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,720
golfers that want to be uh challenge to

349
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,360
the point of like I I you know you got

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
to put a sign up like you do at Beth

351
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Page all right let's get to some of the

352
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,519
numbers um it was a generally cool week

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,800
right I think many people would say

354
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,879
we're still in a bit of a stall I think

355
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,159
grass is growing but here's what I can

356
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,240
tell you as soon as the foot gets on the

357
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,120
pedal for warmth and you keep getting

358
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
these warm nights uh grass we're going

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,759
to start hitting that surge of growth

360
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,880
period we normally get uh in the

361
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,958
springtime with many of our cool seas

362
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:23,360
and grasses um it's been uh warming up

363
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:25,719
rapidly so if you're making your uh soil

364
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,360
drench applications for Fairy ring

365
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,600
you're late for summer Pats you're

366
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,278
probably right on time make sure you use

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,440
the full rate and make sure you put it

368
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:40,958
on with a lot of water if it's going to

369
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,120
rain spray it in the rain uh absolutely

370
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,599
positively the number one reason these

371
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,078
things fail is they do not get deep

372
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,560
enough in the soil profile and if you're

373
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,359
putting this thing on soils that don't

374
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,799
that water doesn't move through very

375
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,879
well put a wedding agent in with it to

376
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,319
help it sort of penetrate and make its

377
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,679
way down and it still is going to be

378
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,440
challenging so you know summer patch is

379
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,879
one of those diseases that we don't know

380
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,800
we got a problem and until later in the

381
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,039
season when the stress comes and worse

382
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:14,559
yet later it the infection periods are

383
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,799
longer and longer and the stress is

384
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,758
going deeper into the fall just as a

385
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,240
reminder we were we were diagnosing Rich

386
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,759
Buckley was diagnosing summer patch into

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,039
October last year so you know you want

388
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,600
to get this early but you also want to

389
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,639
keep track of the stress levels that

390
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,839
your plants are under at particularly

391
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,519
from Summer

392
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,560
patch I was out Western New York and the

393
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,320
first comment I made when we started was

394
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,399
wow it's been a fairly uneventful spring

395
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
to which teren said we got seven inches

396
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,198
of rain in the last couple of weeks I'm

397
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
like oops I guess I wasn't paying

398
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,159
attention but it has actually been if

399
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
you look at the map here fairly wet in

400
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,879
the last month in Western New York even

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,039
though I was thinking it's somewhat on

402
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,639
the dry side you're looking at 200% a

403
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,078
normal from Eerie paa all the way up

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,360
into Rochester and then at the other end

405
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,799
of the Spectrum in the New York

406
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,879
metropolitan area the last month is

407
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:14,000
looking at 25 to 50% 75% of normal so

408
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,919
there's a lot of dry areas I you know

409
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,198
for the two people that live in northern

410
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,879
Maine Carl probably related to you

411
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:24,399
somehow it's very dry up there and I

412
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,759
will say South into Delmarva uh the delm

413
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,159
Marva Peninsula I was down for the

414
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,399
Virginia Tech graduation last week sorry

415
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,240
to miss you all and it's on the dry side

416
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,039
down

417
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,720
there now it looks like uh we're going

418
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,919
to have normal conditions looks like

419
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,120
we're going to have pretty normal

420
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,198
temperatures for the next 8 to 14 days

421
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,720
but I think what we're seeing of this

422
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,838
sort of sporadic rainfall and just warm

423
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
enough is as we're going to talk about

424
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,880
in a second going to start to drive

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,600
growth and G to start to drive diseases

426
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,078
like dollar spot which looks like it's

427
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,879
starting to rear its head so Carl I went

428
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,638
to your growth potential uh thing and I

429
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,879
thought it was very interesting this

430
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,919
past week um bill kryer was uh talk we

431
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,278
were chatting with Bill and and Bill was

432
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,958
talking about growth potential as um

433
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,120
really a measure of the way plants make

434
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:17,719
sugars right not really a measure of how

435
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
they can grow but how they can produce

436
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,360
sugars and he's played around with

437
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,039
looking at the impact of temperature on

438
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,000
growth like you could have high growth

439
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,480
potential but not have enough moisture

440
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,240
right and Carl here's your model on a

441
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,639
clay soil that demonstrated right when

442
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,440
uh the rainfalls came through with no

443
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,480
irrigation you had growth uh in the

444
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,720
plots uh last week or two weeks ago and

445
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,839
then it looked like it just sat there

446
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,800
and now it looks like moisture's coming

447
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,279
again temperatures are rising and in a

448
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,240
clay soil we're going to get into

449
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,639
moderate growth and probably heading

450
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,440
towards the surge of growth that same

451
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:04,640
model directed for a Sandy well- drained

452
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,400
soil indicates you're not going to get

453
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,720
that growth surge by any means so what I

454
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,319
think we've started to learn and we're

455
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,480
Carl you know I want to just take a

456
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,759
minute here and have you chat about this

457
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,480
I know the springtime is not been your

458
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,199
favorite time for this model that we're

459
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,439
not always getting the surge but boy

460
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,439
this feels right now uh based on what

461
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,558
I'm seeing in dry areas they're not

462
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,798
growing as much uh and I will also and

463
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,798
if you have if you have areas where

464
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,359
things are growing very well and you're

465
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,839
getting a lot of traffic traffic is a

466
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,159
beautiful growth regulator I saw a lot

467
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:43,798
of heavily trafficed Turf in the last

468
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,320
few days that just simply wasn't growing

469
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,639
as much as the turf right next to it it

470
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,359
looked perfectly fine I mean it was

471
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,559
Bluegrass dense and then next to it it

472
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,399
was about an inch and a half higher

473
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,558
simply because people were walking there

474
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,960
and you know other than compaction uh a

475
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,440
and traffic not much is different so

476
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,919
talk a little bit Carl about the growth

477
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,960
model in the spring and and this sort of

478
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,159
disparity that I'm showing here between

479
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,880
the two soil types yeah so so just a

480
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,039
general structure of these models is

481
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,559
essentially there's an optimal

482
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,119
temperature that you'll put in and the

483
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,359
original past Turf growth model was

484
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,319
saying hey we expect Optimum growth at

485
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,079
about 67 degrees Fahrenheit for cool

486
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,480
season grasses and so that's what this

487
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,359
model uses and then we also consider

488
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
what's the available soil moisture right

489
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,158
because generally speaking the amount of

490
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,798
top growth you get will be governed by

491
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,720
how much water is sort of moving through

492
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:37,918
that plant you need a vapo transporation

493
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,519
and you need available water right so

494
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
when you have clay soils that hold more

495
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,200
water that's why this model is generally

496
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,400
going to have more growth in those areas

497
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,038
versus Sandy soils uh but the cool thing

498
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,400
about talking to Bill last week he's got

499
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,759
this you know nitrogen responsiveness

500
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,320
index that he calls it and especially

501
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,519
with the Ry grasses early in the year we

502
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,918
find that top growth is not correlated

503
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,079
to sort of photosynthetic capacity so we

504
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,520
say 67 degrees Fahrenheit Optimum

505
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,199
temperature at which photosynthesis

506
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,759
occurs that's the production of of

507
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,558
carbohydrate storage of energy

508
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,359
essentially but then how the plant

509
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:12,038
distributes that energy is governed by

510
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,798
sort of different processes and for Rass

511
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:14,960
that's more like 60 degrees is when it

512
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,240
starts saying hey we're going to we're

513
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,759
going to use that energy on top growth

514
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,440
uh and so I think one of the reasons we

515
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,519
we've seen this model not do so great in

516
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,038
the spring is because especially on

517
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,879
plots with Ry grass we have that that

518
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,798
temperature set a little bit too high

519
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
right so I think it's pretty good for t

520
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,839
Fescue like that tall fescue because

521
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,640
it's going to skew more towards the

522
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,798
warmer end when it grows at an Optimum

523
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,640
rate uh it's probably a good growth rate

524
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,480
for for tall fescue but for something

525
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,440
like Ry grass or po which starts coming

526
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,159
out early in the spring it probably um

527
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,919
is underrating the amount of growth

528
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,240
you're going to get ear season so that's

529
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,559
one of the interesting out of our

530
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,359
conversation with Bill yeah and and and

531
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,918
I I will say Carl I mean if if you have

532
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,959
Sandy soils and you have the ability to

533
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,000
dry them out that is going to be a again

534
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
another effective growth regulator in

535
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,480
the golf world is is uh letting them dry

536
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,360
out now of course as you let them dry

537
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,440
out you have to be careful about uh hyd

538
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,839
you know Soil Breaking and isolated dry

539
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,320
spots and things like that so as you go

540
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,678
for drying things out which is something

541
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,879
we were talking about in this

542
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,240
conversation this time last year when we

543
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,760
were going through the really dry

544
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,200
weather so again when you're thinking

545
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,240
about growth you know historically we

546
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,440
think of a very sort of traditional

547
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,400
growth model uh this is something

548
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,000
alteron and the late great Joe Vargas

549
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,798
proposed many years ago annual Bluegrass

550
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,558
really pretty steady growth except

551
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,599
through the summertime and you know

552
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,639
we're really starting to rethink a lot

553
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,000
of things about annual Bluegrass

554
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,919
perennial type annual type uh but one

555
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,240
thing for sure it grows different than

556
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,640
creeping B grass and again I was looking

557
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,038
at some pretty heavily regulated

558
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,440
Fairways yesterday Carl over at

559
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:03,400
craigb Terren is is not shy on his using

560
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,159
of the Anu uh growth regulator and boy

561
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,759
you could really see the difference in

562
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,120
the um dramatic regulation that you're

563
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,079
getting on the annual Bluegrass and not

564
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,000
much regulation on the creeping Bank

565
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,158
Grass so um he he's uh I don't wouldn't

566
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,240
say he's actively trying to remove the

567
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,159
annual Bluegrass but if you are I saw

568
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,359
some things with the new yesterday and

569
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,679
we've seen some speculation about this

570
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:31,278
from Scott mroy and and Bill kryer that

571
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,679
a new might have some potential uh to

572
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:36,480
take out annual Bluegrass like a like an

573
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,480
herbicide and I think um you know a lot

574
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,200
of people have been uh thinking about

575
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,599
this for a while uh but I think it is

576
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,558
something to consider uh as we start to

577
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,319
try to manage annual Bluegrass and maybe

578
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,119
get rid of it so I just want to talk a

579
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,558
little bit about growth right because we

580
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,199
talk about growth potential and and

581
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:59,759
again just reminding people because I've

582
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,159
gotten so used to seeing over ulated

583
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,839
Turf in the spring in Northern climates

584
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,400
I just think it's good to remind

585
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,119
everybody about this and this is what

586
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,640
bill has been developing for many years

587
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,719
at Greenkeeper are these growing degree

588
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,080
day models that will track the amount of

589
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,759
Regulation that you get and then when

590
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,879
you need to reapply knowing that the

591
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,000
plant and the soil are processing these

592
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,640
plant growth regulators and you can

593
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
measure their effectiveness by

594
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,120
monitoring growth now yesterday Terren

595
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,960
uses

596
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:38,639
230 Growing Degree Days for all of his

597
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,720
pgr applications in fact I would say he

598
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,960
builds his entire program around when he

599
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,558
makes his growth regulator application

600
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,720
which I thought was really really

601
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:50,839
refreshing to see and also creates an

602
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,919
alternative to the banther we normally

603
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,119
get because a good old Joel Lucas was

604
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,679
there yesterday ready to give me a hard

605
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,918
time and Terren was all over the Growing

606
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,679
Degree date and he talked about how bad

607
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,360
the rebound can be and and now with not

608
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,679
many rounds and you know not a lot of

609
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,038
pressure he's Nimble to spray on a

610
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,038
Friday morning or a Sunday morning or a

611
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,038
Wednesday you know what I mean when you

612
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,079
have the flexibility you can really

613
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,679
follow this thing but I think what I

614
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,319
want to say here is if you look

615
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,480
carefully at these lines you see trimit

616
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,000
is the most dramatic regulation followed

617
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,519
by a new and then the lightest amount of

618
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,038
regul at use rates is primo so again you

619
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:37,079
can moderate these uh rates based the

620
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,440
amount of Regulation based on the rate

621
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,639
of the product but the frequency of the

622
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
application continues to be what you

623
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,640
want to pay attention to now again for

624
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,720
those of you watching us live or

625
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,080
watching the video of this you'll have a

626
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,079
really good depiction here of what

627
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:57,119
overregulation can look like when you're

628
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,960
putting on herbicides fungicides growth

629
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,599
Regulators that all have growth

630
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,759
regulating properties you could be

631
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,839
regulating up to 80% of your growth

632
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,679
which is not a problem I mean one of the

633
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,879
things I saw yesterday is they were

634
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,159
mowing Fairways after two days of growth

635
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,480
and you could and find the clipping so

636
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,760
you know I don't ever want to

637
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,319
underestimate the value of really

638
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,798
regulating especially Fairways where you

639
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,599
got 25 acres you're mowing them three

640
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,639
days a week and then you got to go out

641
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,398
and blow them if your growth Regulators

642
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,520
aren't working right because you got

643
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,678
clippings all over the place this is a

644
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,440
really uh important part of man managing

645
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,880
growth in the spring especially during

646
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,320
The Surge now speaking of

647
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,559
surges it's coming if you haven't seen

648
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,319
it yet you will uh place you're GNA find

649
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,398
out how good your seed head suppression

650
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:52,158
is in the next few weeks as the flush of

651
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,239
growth uh starts to come on throughout

652
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,080
the state of New York obviously the New

653
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,679
York metropolitan area is well into its

654
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,000
heavy flush and the rest of the state is

655
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,559
about to experience it so this a really

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,519
good time to keep track of your seed

657
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,079
head suppression programs that as just a

658
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,798
reminder get locked in in the fall and

659
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,480
then uh supported through the early

660
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,158
spring and again every spring we haven't

661
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
talked about it much and I think it's

662
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
sort of a testament to something Ben

663
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,520
told us last year Carl annual Bluegrass

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,120
Weevil is now moving to the secondary

665
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,960
problem status from being a primary

666
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,558
problem but if you are out there uh

667
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,880
looking around you'll see the red

668
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,319
dendrin starting to flower this is a

669
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,640
good time for your larva side

670
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:40,960
applications for those of you that pay

671
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,759
attention to the senta greencast blog

672
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,440
that uh Ben puts out um you can see that

673
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,278
the the basically with a warm spell at

674
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,200
the end of April has accelerated stage

675
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:56,839
two which means stages one and two are

676
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,000
coming together so you might be making a

677
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:03,319
early inar and a late in Star at the

678
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,440
same time so you want to pay attention

679
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,678
to this application especially if you're

680
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,600
not making adulti side applications

681
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,480
anymore this larvicide is your sole

682
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,839
chance to get control now thankfully

683
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,079
we're not as dry as we were so the grass

684
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,000
is humming along pretty good we always

685
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,720
know annual Bluegrass Weevil damage

686
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,398
tends to be worse when there's uh you

687
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,000
know other stresses and so hopefully we

688
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:30,798
can grow through it but I do think when

689
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,440
we're coming at the end of seed heads

690
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,440
you see a natural decline in your annual

691
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,200
Bluegrass population because all those

692
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,720
tillers that flow die so you get normal

693
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,440
thinning then you get the potential for

694
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,919
annual Bluegrass Weevil problems so you

695
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,519
want to keep track of this I also think

696
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,159
these are times when if you start

697
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,960
pushing it especially when it's wet and

698
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,039
soft and you start causing some physical

699
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,480
or mechanical damage to those putting

700
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,599
surfaces I am sure you're going to see

701
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,720
anthos no matter how many things you

702
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,319
spray if you start to cause that stress

703
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,880
if you're getting a little night light

704
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,480
with nitrogen because you're freaking

705
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,720
out about green speed early maybe you're

706
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,360
a little over regulated I wouldn't be

707
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,000
surprised to see anthros jump at uh you

708
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,278
know show its uh unsightly head uh

709
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,599
couple more things before I uh close up

710
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,919
and we maybe take some questions just a

711
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,398
reminder we're in the midst of no M

712
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,919
which means long should be flowering

713
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:34,079
like crazy based on our risk assessment

714
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
model this is really what it's going to

715
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,798
look like for a while now right Carl

716
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,200
with the Clover population beginning to

717
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,960
come and and just a a a healthy reminder

718
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,840
you know we say if you're going to apply

719
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,519
anything make sure you mow but you also

720
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,199
want to make sure that after you mow

721
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,599
those flowers are gone and if they're

722
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,200
not do not apply things to that lawn

723
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,359
it's just not worth the risk I mean

724
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,600
making an applic especially in

725
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,439
insecticide which we're in that window

726
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,599
now between dandelion and clover

727
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,320
flowering maybe where you can get your

728
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,359
grub control down the first thing I tell

729
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,519
you is kill the damn weeds first if

730
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,119
that's what you're going to do get rid

731
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,759
of the weeds if you want a flowering

732
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,558
lawn don't start applying insecticides

733
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,480
to it that just doesn't make any sense

734
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,879
and of course we've been on and on about

735
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,759
no M may but soon June 1 will come and

736
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
then this is what is awaiting everyone

737
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:30,839
and it's going to be very interesting to

738
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,359
see there's a number of uh online

739
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,839
citizen science research projects going

740
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,798
on that we'll be looking forward to now

741
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:42,678
as I wrap it up Carl we got this picture

742
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:45,240
from our pal Dr Sito the director of uh

743
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:48,200
golf and sports turf here at Cornell uh

744
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,440
dollar spots uh underway and uh our

745
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,798
models uh indicating uh this is is

746
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,080
what's going on and and again you know

747
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,879
you have areas that are of high risk and

748
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:01,480
high value uh I think it's uh maybe a

749
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,600
little bit earlier than I thought it was

750
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,720
going to be uh but it's also moving into

751
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,879
the point where high value turf's

752
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,278
probably going to need some protection

753
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,200
uh from this dollar spot so Carl that's

754
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:17,159
what I got for today um what do you what

755
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,798
any questions or other things we want to

756
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,519
cover before we get out of here yeah I

757
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:23,000
don't I don't see any questions uh you

758
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,319
know maybe we'll show data next week

759
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,558
Frank but it's interesting we've talked

760
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,519
about noo May for a couple years now and

761
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,119
I don't see the Google Trends can go on

762
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,159
this Google Trends page and look at

763
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,918
Search terms like noo and see the

764
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,640
relative sort of intensity of Search

765
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,519
terms over the years and we're not

766
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,759
seeing it at the same level as we have

767
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,159
been seeing it the last three years uh

768
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,720
so yeah is that due to the Cornell Turf

769
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,720
Show talking about the science behind no

770
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,679
I don't know if you know correlation is

771
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,079
not causation but um we we are seeing a

772
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,798
trend I think of people being a little

773
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,960
more strategic in and how they're

774
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,839
thinking about

775
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,278
pollinators than just sort of letting

776
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,240
grass grow and then chopping it down and

777
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:02,038
and I know you know as we wrap up in the

778
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,038
golf section Carl just want to tell you

779
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:07,158
yesterday the bunker conversation came

780
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:08,919
up again um this it's very interesting

781
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,880
when you get a group of superintendant

782
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:16,840
together uh the the topic around lining

783
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,240
right cloth sad Billy bunker capcon

784
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,038
that's a very interesting conversation

785
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,679
then it's white sand dark sand what kind

786
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:29,440
of sand and then it's hand rake uh

787
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,240
mechanical rake uh Australian method and

788
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,840
and and and and and now you know

789
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,839
particularly Craig bur they're going to

790
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:38,199
really go through they they got some

791
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:41,839
aerial that show these very Jagged tooth

792
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,480
bunkers uh Terence kept saying Pasa TMO

793
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,158
like sort of bunkers that honestly are

794
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,798
not very Trent Jonesy but they've got

795
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,799
these images from 69 that show that so

796
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,200
just another shout out to golf course

797
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:59,038
superintendants about keeping people uh

798
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,759
mindful of the amount of time and energy

799
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,200
you're spending in these hazards and how

800
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,720
much it contributes to the overall uh

801
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,840
sort of Labor demands that a golf course

802
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,798
has um Terren is about 27 to 29 guys uh

803
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,439
on an 18-hole property and when he puts

804
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,079
those bunkers in he's going to need

805
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,038
every one of them uh based on what I saw

806
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:24,278
so just a shout out again to everybody

807
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:27,000
working on Bunker stuff um it's sort of

808
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,240
this hidden cost that we know about and

809
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,638
everybody complains about but I think

810
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,000
impacts the whole

811
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,879
operation yeah and and and there's data

812
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,839
now and and Adam Engle at Lakeshore was

813
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,200
telling us a lot of superintendent per

814
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,759
acre uh bunkers take the same amount of
