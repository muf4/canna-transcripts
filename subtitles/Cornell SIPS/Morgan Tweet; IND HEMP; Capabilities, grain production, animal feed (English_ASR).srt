working with are winter wheat spring

95

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,879

00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,560

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,280

communicate success with our people our

110
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,198
planet and our profit and so we want to

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,519
focus on those things in that order and

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,720
um I think that's really boed well for

113
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,560
us and in the success that we've had we

114
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,560
were established in 2018 um my dad's

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,600
been doing hemp those since about 2013

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,439
he's got the first license in Montana um

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,680
all the way back to the 2014 farm bill

118
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,759
and has been working it and then um I

119
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,478
left my career with ADM and as crazy of

120
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,720
an adventure as it started it sort of

121
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:28,079
really took effect um after the farm

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,280
bill passed in December of 2018 we

123
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,839
started in Grain Manufacturing and then

124
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,799
um quickly evolved into fiber as well so

125
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,758
just a few photos of you know our people

126
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
and the work we're doing in our

127
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
facilities um they mean a lot to us

128
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,159
that's what encourages and inspires me

129
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,799
every day and um just hope to do a good

130
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,680
job for

131
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,439
them um our mission and our vision I'm

132
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,600
not going to read it um it's entirety

133
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,519
you can definitely come on to our

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,199
website but I think it does a great job

135
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,318
of um articulating what we see and what

136
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
what we want to do the things I like to

137
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,240
highlight is that you know we really

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,639
want to create value in the supply chain

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,319
it's a very clear need that we have as

140
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,918
an industry is continuing to focus on

141
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
the right steps in the process and we

142
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,879
want to do it with integrity and really

143
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,279
focus on those things so like I said

144
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,759
focusing on the relationship with the

145
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,439
farmer um making sure that they're not

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
getting the last cut but they're you

147
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,279
know their needs and um their

148
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,119
integration is is considered at the

149
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,719
Forefront and then obviously um really

150
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,079
championing the opportunity to work

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,560
pioneers of um different ENT

152
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,399
entrepreneurial businesses that see hemp

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,759
as a real um opportunity to create

154
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,120
lasting change whether it's as a

155
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
material or a food or feed

156
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,120
ingredient um it really starts on the

157
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,679
farm we're going to do go into quite a

158
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,720
bit of agronomy stuff I know that you

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,879
guys have some other sessions to be even

160
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,360
more focused on that but you know back

161
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,120
to our mission this is why it started

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,639
for us we wanted to create value in

163
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,280
rural Montana and we wanted to see a new

164
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,519
rotation crap that could bring Revenue

165
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,399
to our friends and family um that were

166
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,639
just having a hard time with the price

167
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,159
of wheat every year so it's been really

168
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,519
fun to see um starting with grain and

169
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,840
then working with fiber genetics as well

170
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
they're two very different production

171
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,918
models we're going to focus on grain

172
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,598
today uh but we've learned a lot in the

173
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,359
six plus years that we've been doing

174
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,199
production and um really understand the

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,560
value and importance of focusing on the

176
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,160
farm

177
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,918
first this is our footprint um it needs

178
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,120
to be updated a little bit but generally

179
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,680
speaks to sort of where we're at on the

180
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,000
presence um Montana is definitely an a

181
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,959
state and a lot of value U manufacturing

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,519
has also brought our economy up and so

183
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,478
what you see here um in the stars are

184
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,279
our facility in Fort bton which is where

185
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,918
all of our manufacturing is done and

186
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,799
then our main corporate office and then

187
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,799
we have an office in Belgrade as well

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,520
which is serves as a warehouse and then

189
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,038
a lot of our sales and finance team is

190
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,598
located there also then you can see all

191
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,199
of our partner Farms um this has been

192
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,279
updated for a few years so there's more

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,120
than that but as you can see we're

194
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,719
pretty um diverse Montana is a really

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
big State we have to cover a lot of

196
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,400
territory we've actually done some

197
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,560
production in in Canada as well we've

198
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,799
done some seed production also in the

199
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,879
midwest um Kansas Texas Indiana um so

200
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,639
we've we've sort of have a good pulse on

201
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,879
generally what genetics works and what

202
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,240
regions but been hyperfocused on trying

203
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,919
to optimize yields and efficiencies in

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,918
our region as

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,120
well um we really focus on that grower

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,840
um relationship we've to date had about

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,399
30 ,000 Acres that we've managed um we

208
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,759
don't personally grow but we work with

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,759
um farmers and contract with them and

210
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,399
that's the production model that you see

211
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,838
with most Commodities but it's worked

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,360
well for us um focusing on Family Farms

213
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,680
we'd like to stay within 400 mile radius

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,839
closer is better um you know 100 miles

215
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,559
would be awesome but the reality is is

216
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,320
we have to you know go where the acres

217
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,838
are and um being geographically diverse

218
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,760
also helps us mitigate some risk so we

219
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,600
do have a full-time anonomous on staff

220
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,039
we do also usually have a a um seasonal

221
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,040
intern that will help as well so we're

222
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,639
there from you know everything from seed

223
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,799
selection to um when they're when

224
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,639
they're planting and doing seed counts

225
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,719
and um stand counts throughout the

226
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,078
season helping them with their nutrition

227
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,079
program um so it's a very Hands-On uh

228
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,559
relationship and so we get feedback from

229
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:26,239
them throughout the year as well um

230
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,559
everything from you know seed and and

231
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,360
fiber storage um to transportation and

232
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:35,799
Material Handling needs we are the ly of

233
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,399
x59 which is a variety based out of

234
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,879
Canada it's worked really well for us

235
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,958
and then we're also the owner of IH

236
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:45,399
Williams which is a high yielding fiber

237
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:47,879
variety um it's also known as SS beta um

238
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,639
in a lot of University trials so maybe

239
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,039
you have heard of both of those

240
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,278
varieties and we've seen success in our

241
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,799
region and both um and then have

242
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,759
continued to keep an eye on and trial a

243
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,559
lot of other varieties as well our goal

244
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,120
is always to provide the best variety um

245
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,599
for our Farmers to maximize their yields

246
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,679
and um meeting the quality specs that we

247
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,759
need as a processor as

248
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,239
well so really the buckets of products

249
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,879
that we make um sort of fall either into

250
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,360
hemp food hemp feed or hemp fiber we're

251
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,240
not going to talk a whole lot about hemp

252
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,560
fiber but we do have a decortication

253
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,919
facility and so those products that

254
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:28,958
we're going to be selling is um Bast

255
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,919
fiber cleaned and sized herd and then

256
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:35,359
some co-products and so um the general

257
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,679
number I think that's nice to articulate

258
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,519
to folks is between our facilities we

259
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,958
can manage somewhere between 20 and

260
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,278
30,000 acres of hemp really depends on

261
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,119
um you know what that that production

262
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,000
mix looks like in terms of dual purpose

263
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,240
or single purpose production um but I

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
say that just sort of in the grand

265
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
scheme of things um you know we're one

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,320
of the largest processors in the United

267
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,799
States and 10 to 30,000 acres is not

268
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,240
even a drop in the bucket for most

269
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,000
Commodities and so it's definitely an

270
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,680
industry that has a lot of room to grow

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,639
and a lot of room for other processors

272
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,519
to get um on boarded I know generally

273
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,000
hemp Farmers or excuse me farmers are

274
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,320
definitely interested in hemp they're

275
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,600
looking for a new cash crop or something

276
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,639
at least competitive and then they're

277
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,480
also looking for something that um adds

278
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,399
value to their rotation to their soils

279
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,440
so we'll dig into that a little bit more

280
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,600
as

281
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,000
well um this is a quick look of our

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,320
facilities again I'm not going to go

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,639
into too much detail on our production

284
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,079
um just we can definitely cover

285
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
questions but um was asked to sort of do

286
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,479
some other things but both of these

287
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,958
locations are in Fort Bon they're about

288
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,039
you know not even half mile away from

289
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,278
one another um on the left is our fiber

290
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,159
facility you can see the raw straw bales

291
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,679
that are outside um we usually try to

292
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,278
keep about a month's worth of inventory

293
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,399
on hand um and then on the right is our

294
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,078
oil seeds facility so we have seed

295
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,879
cleaning and then um seed processing and

296
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:02,958
two separate buildings with some on-site

297
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,720
storage as well we do have the the um

298
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,479
you know rest or the uh menu of

299
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,160
certifications that we're really proud

300
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
of we work hard for we had our um annual

301
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,078
organic audit yesterday that was went

302
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,320
over really well we've just been um

303
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,239
blessed with a great quality team and a

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
production team that continue to you

305
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
know hold us up to these high standards

306
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,278
and we are confident with what we

307
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,439
communicate to customers um for both of

308
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,439
our

309
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,919
businesses um some Brands just because

310
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,278
we've continued to um Garner more value

311
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,278
in the supply chain and so going further

312
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:40,240
down um the value chain has helped us to

313
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,480
continue to to get that value the

314
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,440
products that we sell mostly fiber

315
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,519
related are elocks and hemp Tana um we

316
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
start with bedding products but then

317
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
we're uh have the opportunity to also

318
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,278
highlight our supplement and feed

319
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
products with um oil seeds so those are

320
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,799
two animal care products one's more

321
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,198
targeted to you know a smaller animal

322
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,240
versus is you know a farm and ranch

323
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,799
style um animal then we have our Montana

324
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,039
gold which is represented both in sort

325
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,679
of lawn and garden and then we've also

326
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,719
been successful in converting into

327
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,759
textile and been working with um some

328
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,519
smaller Brands to launch our monana gold

329
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,278
into some um finished apparel products

330
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,078
and then our IH oil seed products most

331
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,480
of our feed or excuse me our food is

332
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,399
being sold in bulk um we don't have

333
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,399
currently a retail facing brand um but

334
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,078
continue to support other brands both

335
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,078
domestically and

336
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,278
internationally current applications

337
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,519
that you sort of see us in um a lot of

338
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,639
this is fiber just since it's a more

339
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,159
diverse um sectors that it can sort of

340
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,839
play in but we see non-wovens as compos

341
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,879
and composits as a big opportunity for

342
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,480
us absorption textiles soil amendments

343
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,639
human and animal nutrition um so this

344
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,399
was a picture taken at agon the mall

345
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,320
we're partners with the national hemp

346
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,320
Association they did a great setup um in

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,600
DC and and it was nice to Showcase some

348
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,120
of our products um along with some other

349
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,120
well-known hint processors in the

350
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,599
US um so we'll jump into grain

351
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,958
production um so sort of the agenda

352
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,320
basic cultivation knowledge what we've

353
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,039
learned what we need to continue

354
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,560
investigating some Harvest and grain

355
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,919
handling and then product development

356
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,599
and

357
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,799
challenges so there's a lot of

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,000
information on this slide um this is

359
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,679
sort of the basic management practices

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it is you know um kind of where we start

361
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,359
with a lot of our Growers um I'll make

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,679
sure that these slides are available to

363
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,440
share so you guys don't feel like you

364
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,758
have to you know frantically write notes

365
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,720
um some of the things I think are

366
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,600
important to highlight you know it can

367
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,040
be used either in conventional tillage

368
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,800
or no till most of the production in our

369
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,399
area is no till um and so we've seen

370
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,639
that be really successful the probably

371
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,480
highest risk um like most crops but uh

372
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,560
planting is where we can really either

373
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,759
make or break the season so it's

374
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,719
important to get the right depth um and

375
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,919
space spacing you know timing it

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,759
definitely is more flexible than I would

377
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,120
say some other crops you can go as early

378
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,480
as late April to early June um we've

379
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,879
seen pros and cons to both sort of um

380
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,519
looking at the production of what you

381
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,519
need if if you're trying to mitigate

382
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,519
weed pressure that's your number one

383
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,240
concerned maybe planting earlier to try

384
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,720
to get um the the uh crop established

385
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,959
earlier if you're trying to chase

386
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,600
moisture maybe you know looking at the

387
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:31,399
forecast a little bit more um it is

388
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,879
fairly Frost resistant I would say you

389
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,360
know trying to Target that 50° soil

390
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,360
temperature though is probably the the

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,800
best time to look at planning um

392
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,959
planning density is definitely a big

393
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,519
thing to sort of um work with your

394
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,518
whoever you're working with production

395
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,399
wise because that is what we see the

396
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,360
play the biggest role definitely

397
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,519
depending on if you're growing for fiber

398
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,800
or grain purposes for seed production I

399
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,560
would say targeting 200 to 300 plants

400
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,439
per 300,000 plants per acre

401
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,679
um is a good place to start it'll depend

402
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,480
um on your variety the seed size and

403
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:11,439
hemp crass varieties is very different

404
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,639
some are nice round plump seeds that um

405
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
you know their bushel weight's going to

406
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,759
be different than some of these really

407
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,559
smaller seeds so I think working with

408
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,240
your processor who's going to be

409
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,278
purchasing the commodity is probably the

410
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,278
most important thing to understand that

411
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,318
and then working with the um whoever

412
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,198
owns the variety to give that sort of

413
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,519
insight into your um pounds per acre

414
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,799
planted um on the right I sort of

415
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,720
outlined our growth cycles of what we

416
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:40,000
see um you definitely have uh most of

417
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,600
the varieties are dous so you have male

418
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and female plants coming up um this sort

419
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,680
of outlines when you'll see the males

420
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
start showing those reproductive organs

421
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,159
first um when you'll start to see pollen

422
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,958
drop and then when those um seeds start

423
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,719
to really fill out I think one of the

424
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,518
challenging things that we see every

425
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,720
year and it's sort of the the um wrist

426
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,400
that fer take is around Harvest um a lot

427
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,558
of variables come into play because it

428
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,319
is an indeterminant plant meaning it'll

429
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,678
just continue to put on seeds until um

430
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,798
you know something kills the the plant

431
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,000
you'll see nice mature large seeds at

432
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,160
the bottom of the seed head and then

433
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,078
you'll see small immature green seeds at

434
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,199
the top that really have no value and so

435
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,038
um that's sort of a thing that farmers

436
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,240
have to evaluate when they're looking at

437
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:32,079
maximizing yield is when to cut um um so

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,960
a lot of things I think every year our

439
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,279
Growers get more confident in their

440
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,079
decisions um obviously Mother Nature has

441
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,000
a pretty big role to play for us um

442
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,960
moisture is what we're chasing most of

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,038
the time if we're on Dryland Acres we

444
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,798
have had a lot of success on irrigated

445
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:51,240
Acres um but just for reference in our

446
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,319
region you know we're working with 10 to

447
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,359
12 inches of annual prip out in like

448
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,158
Pennsylvania and New York you guys are

449
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,399
probably somewhere between like 35 and

450
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,760
50 Ines

451
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,440
so big difference in moisture needs um I

452
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,558
think everyone thinks hemp can do all

453
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,720
things with limited resources and it is

454
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:12,359
always surprising what it is resilient

455
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,440
to but just like most things green it

456
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,439
wants water and it wants

457
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,919
nutrition um here are some biofactors

458
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,798
and sort of what we've learned um hemp

459
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,919
definitely allows for very biodiverse

460
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,400
soils it's bringing new organisms in um

461
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,600
it's helping promote that activity so

462
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,519
we've seen some value there on the soil

463
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,759
side um you do see to comp see some

464
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,158
competition with weeds early on and so

465
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,158
there are a few chemistries that have

466
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,679
been successful I sort of outlin them on

467
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,200
the side there this is for our region so

468
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,640
I can't speak to what everyone will um

469
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,880
have access to or see success with but I

470
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,240
did think it was important to throw this

471
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,960
on here we're big fans of regenerative

472
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,240
um agricultural practices we promote

473
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,279
that a lot um we also do organic

474
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,839
production so you know we take a a full

475
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,879
holistic approach um we think hemp is an

476
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,599
awesome crop to revitalize agriculture

477
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,440
in general and because of its ability to

478
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,359
be more resilient its lack of or its

479
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,960
reduced needs and um inputs then what it

480
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,959
does at the soil level we think that

481
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,480
there's a lot of things that can be used

482
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,720
in a um transition program for those

483
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,919
farmers who are looking to either go

484
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,519
organic or go um um regenerative but the

485
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,400
reality is is like like conventional

486
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,200
practices are still very much needed for

487
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,280
a lot of folks and so we try to just fit

488
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,600
all applications and um all

489
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,319
operations so um for weeds if you can

490
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,158
get the crop out of the ground and well

491
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,439
established we see a lot of competition

492
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,480
happen throughout um throughout the year

493
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,519
and hemp usually WIS out there with its

494
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,759
canopy closure some pests to be aware of

495
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,679
there definitely some aphids

496
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,480
grasshoppers caterpillars spider mites

497
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,240
you know I know there's probably more in

498
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,159
other regions um

499
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,359
but generally because of some of those

500
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,960
tpin and cannaboids we think um that

501
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,240
there's some natural repellents that are

502
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,919
there for us the most devastating pest

503
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,839
is caterpillars or excuse me sorry most

504
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,640
devastating pest is

505
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,918
Grasshoppers and that's more due to um

506
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,640
hemp is the last thing that guys Harvest

507
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,679
around here and so um grasshoppers are

508
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,440
going to be looking for moisture and so

509
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,159
as the wheat is cut and all their pulse

510
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,080
crops are cut you know they sort of go

511
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,640
to the last green thing out there which

512
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,079
almost always ends up being hemp um so

513
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,720
we've definitely had our years 2020

514
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:38,918
through 2022 are pretty rough um still

515
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
don't have a great solution for that but

516
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,840
um generally speaking that's about all

517
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,639
the pest pressure we see um definitely

518
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,480
see the pollinators like it especially

519
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,759
when those males are out it's amazing

520
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,839
you can walk through the fields and just

521
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,158
see all the bees there so we know that's

522
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:56,038
a great thing um for your ecosystems as

523
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,559
well and then some diseases to be aware

524
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,519
of um variety dependent um we see some

525
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,240
of those Tarpin also playing a role I

526
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,798
think um and then and definitely the um

527
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,240
structure of the seed head so some of

528
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,879
those grain varieties have tighter seed

529
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,079
heads that hold on to moisture a little

530
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,440
bit more don't allow for that seed to

531
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,918
breathe and so sometimes we can have

532
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,360
some mildew or mold um we don't have

533
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,360
that a lot in our region but we

534
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,399
definitely know of it um in other places

535
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,439
as

536
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,200
well um I think some of the things to

537
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,320
learn to sort of highlight um it

538
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,080
definitely is region specific and I mean

539
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,200
that's

540
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,319
not not a shocker there we see that for

541
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,679
every other um commodity or crop we're

542
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,918
growing but it is important to highlight

543
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,400
that you know hemp is behind obviously

544
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,960
by several decades and when you look at

545
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,440
the germ plasms available and um the

546
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,840
breeding programs that have been

547
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,240
successful him just has a a long way

548
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,639
ahead of it um I think there's some

549
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,319
fantastic companies out there doing

550
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,840
great work um making Headway both in

551
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,359
hybrid opportunities and such um but we

552
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,119
really need to see that increase um both

553
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,359
in just the varieties that are available

554
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:06,239
to increase yield but region specific um

555
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,558
varieties as well I think understanding

556
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,000
you know what are the important traits

557
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,000
you're looking for whether it's maturity

558
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,440
to due to like Harvest timing um or

559
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,119
plant height um seed head architecture

560
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,120
those are all things to keep in in mind

561
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,918
when choosing variety um and then it

562
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,239
also is really important to talk about

563
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,559
what your planning to do for Harvest um

564
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,200
because that'll play a role in what you

565
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,440
want those traits mostly plant height I

566
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,400
think is is is really the big thing to

567
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,000
um determine there but these are all

568
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,519
things to to

569
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,400
consider um I was asked to share sort of

570
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,278
what varieties we've grown so I've

571
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,000
thrown up these I'm sure I'm missing a

572
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:47,960
couple um but we try to do a good job of

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,359
having a um commercial scale plot trials

574
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,440
out every year so the last year and this

575
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,798
year we've had about 120 Acres um that

576
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,759
we divvy up between you know 10 and 20

577
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,798
acre plots um it's great to work with

578
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,240
universities to get those you know those

579
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,158
TR those plot trials that are you know a

580
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,798
half acre or less um but really rubber

581
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,640
meets the road when you start seeing

582
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,038
these commercial size um trials and

583
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,840
seeing how these varieties perform under

584
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:17,480
the same conditions same soil type

585
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,599
things like that so um happy to you know

586
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,519
give some insight for our area on these

587
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,119
varieties if people are looking for that

588
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,440
um we always try to have an open book

589
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:30,119
open door policy and try to be as

590
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,120
collaborative as possible

591
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,480
um grain Harvest storage and handling is

592
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,399
really really important um I'd say if

593
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,319
not more important than that planting

594
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,120
risk um you can have a beautiful crop

595
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:46,359
and really excited about your season and

596
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,038
it you can ruin it in one day and just a

597
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,839
couple hours if you don't handle it well

598
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,480
um so first off you're going to be you

599
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:55,639
know cutting it either with like a

600
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,919
draper header or um you know just a a

601
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,000
classic combine um you could SWA it as

602
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,960
well um and then come back with combine

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,319
header Harvest it I think the biggest

604
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,159
thing to focus on there are your

605
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,678
settings and your combine um to to clean

606
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,559
the seed we definitely know that it is

607
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,679
you know um High foreign material um

608
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,319
because of that indeterminate nature

609
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,600
you're going to be harvesting really

610
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,879
great dry beautiful seeds but you're

611
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,240
also going to be bringing in a lot of

612
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,919
trash with um both the the bra and the

613
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,759
leaves and then all those immature seeds

614
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,159
as well which hold on to moisture

615
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,480
moisture is not your friend in this case

616
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,840
um because that's you know where we see

617
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,519
mold and other issues so um we talked to

618
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,720
our Farmers about using augers um it is

619
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,240
a fragile seed so similar to peas or

620
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,480
other things you know you can use an

621
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,200
augur you just need to go slow um since

622
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,919
seeds will crack and then that's a

623
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,919
quality concern you know because of its

624
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,520
high oil content it's going to want to

625
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,278
go rant it pretty quick um bin storage

626
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,558
is really important to have set up ahead

627
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,000
of harvest too making sure you have air

628
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,158
ation um we are fortunate enough here in

629
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,159
our region that most of the time we

630
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,640
don't need heaters our relative humidity

631
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,320
is manageable I do know in other areas

632
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,080
though if you don't have you know

633
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,439
relative humidity in your in your favor

634
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,158
um need to make sure that you have a

635
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,399
heater on there to keep that moisture

636
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,960
out um being careful to keep those

637
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,798
temperatures down you know just has that

638
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,038
low flash point so um I definitely think

639
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,359
we can give some insight there as well

640
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,640
good rule of thumb is making sure that

641
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,599
if you're harvesting above 10% moisture

642
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,919
you need to get your Grain on air within

643
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,798
four hours that's sort of a

644
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,240
non-negotiable um so making sure you

645
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:41,558
have that plan some guys will don't have

646
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,399
that access or are challenged with with

647
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:46,960
things and so they'll actually choose to

648
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,038
harvest either swath it and let it dry

649
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,558
in the field or harvest it at much drier

650
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,960
conditions um those risk is you have

651
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,480
shatter and other um you know bird

652
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,558
pressure things like that you can lose

653
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,200
some yield if you wait for that but

654
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,158
fundamentally if you don't have a way to

655
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,558
dry your grain you sort of don't have an

656
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,720
option you have to cut it at low

657
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,558
moistures um and then turning over your

658
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,640
bed and making sure you're keeping it on

659
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:16,000
it for spoilage is really

660
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,120
important um this is a raw food and so

661
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,919
we need to be careful and cognizant of

662
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,719
your your truck and trailer um we do

663
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,799
truck affidavits with our Growers so

664
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,558
making sure they get into The Hoppers

665
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,440
and make sure everything's cleaned up

666
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,079
like I said hem shoes are the last thing

667
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,320
Harvest and so we're following something

668
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,199
else whether it's wheat or peas or

669
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,398
something else um hemp typically is

670
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,240
allergen free and so it's important for

671
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,759
us to try to keep that at the farm level

672
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,319
you know our biggest risk is wheat um it

673
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,200
is also considered generally gluten-free

674
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:50,038
so making sure we get all those wheat

675
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,798
kernels out it's really

676
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,319
important um just want to like when I

677
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,480
talked about hemp as an opportunity for

678
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,759
more sustainable agricultural practices

679
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,798
I think it sort of

680
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,278
um this is like the Four Points I like

681
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,639
to highlight generally we see overall

682
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:08,119
lower inputs everything from herbicides

683
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,840
and pesticides even to you know water

684
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,000
usage um a lot of people are really

685
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,599
excited about hemp when we look at you

686
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,278
know some of these aquafers drying up

687
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,678
and other things hemp definitely has a

688
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,398
role to play and I think that the more

689
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,960
we get a handle on what its means are

690
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:24,319
and what our production expectations are

691
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,200
um and then the economy economies that

692
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,599
survive um for those those costing

693
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,880
models is really important also we

694
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,199
definitely know hemp is great carbon uh

695
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,720
great at sequestering Carbon you know

696
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,240
it's very fast growing and we know that

697
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
there's a lot of biomass on the field

698
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,599
especially when we're growing for fiber

699
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,440
we've been working with um a group to to

700
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,678
be able to articulate our carbon

701
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,600
sequestration numbers and then we also

702
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,919
articulate that in our um our lcas with

703
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,398
our products so we think there's a role

704
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,120
to play in um the fight against climate

705
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,359
as

706
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,359
well definitely hemp improves some

707
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,240
biodiversity we're bringing in you know

708
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,918
a new soil structure with uh or excuse

709
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,240
me a new root structure that definitely

710
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,000
helps with the soil we see other

711
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,640
pollinators and other things coming and

712
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,038
really helping build up a resilient

713
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,240
ecosystem for the soil I think everyone

714
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,240
in the last decade in agriculture has

715
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
realized how important it is to focus on

716
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,960
soil Health um everything from adopting

717
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,360
no till practices or minimal till

718
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,480
practices to you know how we can

719
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,199
increase biologics in the in the soil

720
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,120
it's really important and I think hemp's

721
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
a great crop to help complement those um

722
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,199
practices and then generally it's a

723
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,359
minimal waste product um what's awesome

724
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,720
is even when you're growing for grain

725
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,038
you know you can really model that that

726
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,640
dual crop um scenario where we can

727
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,919
Harvest for both the Grain and Seed head

728
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,399
but also for that residual fiber and

729
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,000
bring value and we're finding more and

730
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,199
more valuable homes um for these

731
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,038
co-products and so that's exciting to

732
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,080
see for an industry that only has you

733
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,158
know half a decade under its belt here

734
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:03,558
in the US um to continue to see value

735
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,559
opportunities for these

736
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:10,319
byproducts um so real talk about food um

737
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,759
and feed so we did a market survey last

738
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,079
year to sort of get a feel and help um

739
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,119
point us in our direction of where we

740
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,639
want to go with food um and I thought

741
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,558
this was really encouraging so this was

742
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,880
one of the slides I took from you know

743
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,759
how currently consumers are looking at

744
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
hemp and um it's nice to see that you

745
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,000
know we're almost at the 50th percentile

746
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,599
for for consumers that are already using

747
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,480
these ingredients in their diet um and

748
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,199
so more room to grow but you know it's a

749
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
lack of perception that you know

750
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,679
everyone still thinks that we're an

751
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,919
intoxicating product um clearly about

752
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
50% of people are eating it in some form

753
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,960
or fashion so I think where we've made

754
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,798
progress in the last

755
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,360
decade um I did take this slide from um

756
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,759
Sam Garing is the um marketing officer

757
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,278
with till and Manitoba Harvest so going

758
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,119
to give him appropriate credit but I

759
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,720
thought it was a really good slide to

760
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,599
Showcase you know from a food

761
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,480
perspective where we're seeing hemp sort

762
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:07,079
of grow um they have a wonderful brand

763
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,240
that they've really grown and invested

764
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,000
in um you know it's been legal in Canada

765
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,359
about two decades more than it is here

766
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,519
and so they've got a little bit of a

767
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,038
head start start on us and they've done

768
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,519
a great job of um incorporating hemp

769
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,398
food um into you know store shelves and

770
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,399
then the consumer

771
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,440
basis nutritionally sort of what we have

772
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,759
and you know a little bit of beyond the

773
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,399
basics but what we're generally speaking

774
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,720
of um from the macronutrients is you

775
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,239
know 20 to 30% carbohydrates 10 to 15%

776
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,480
of that being in soluble fiber somewhere

777
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,640
between 25 and 35% oil and 20 to 25%

778
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,519
protein we have seen this you know

779
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,679
fluctuate a little bit from

780
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,120
varieties um but this is some good

781
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,000
standards um it is a really unique

782
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:54,199
complete protein meaning it has all

783
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,638
those nine essential amino acids but

784
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,600
it's also you know encouraging as the

785
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,959
The increased bioavailability so what we

786
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,240
can digest this protein composition also

787
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,079
is is pretty unique so that slide on or

788
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,159
excuse me that graph on the right there

789
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,480
is showing those amino acids and it's

790
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,320
it's comparing it to um other proteins

791
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,798
that we probably complement in the food

792
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:19,839
space so P protein soy protein faab Bean

793
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,519
protein um I think albumin and Edison

794
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,480
are probably the most exciting ones that

795
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,240
we see pretty unique for hemp and I

796
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,639
think food formulators are continuing to

797
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,480
focus on those things um to highlight

798
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,719
that you know the consumer basis is

799
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,880
obviously growing in its consumer

800
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,200
awareness of the value of protein in its

801
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,519
diets and so we're sort of poised to be

802
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,639
able to take advantage of that and think

803
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,638
hemp has a role to play um it's also

804
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,719
still a good source of those plant-based

805
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,918
polyunsaturated fats we talk about

806
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,159
hemp's um unique Omega Omega fatty acid

807
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,240
profile that 6 to3 ratio a really ideal

808
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,519
for absorption and metab Metabolism we

809
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,240
see that value proposition also showing

810
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,558
up in feed applications we talked about

811
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,839
the allergens um which is is always good

812
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,879
to have an ingredient that we don't have

813
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,759
to worry about that and there's also

814
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,880
meaningful mineral micronutrient and

815
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,038
anti-nutrient properties as hemp as

816
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,639
well um I sort of highlighted you know

817
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,398
where I think a potential you know my

818
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,798
background working with ADM I saw a lot

819
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,319
of um growth in um protein isolates and

820
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,240
protein concentrates and so I think as

821
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,079
we talk about the value proposition hemp

822
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,759
has with protein you know we can't can't

823
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,439
miss um talking about isolates and

824
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,440
concentrates as well um it definitely is

825
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,759
a challenge and you there's been some

826
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,798
great processors that have been working

827
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,119
on this they've listed a few here I know

828
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,879
that others are working on it um but

829
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,959
it's conceptually just trying to isolate

830
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,240
those proteins or concentrate up those

831
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,679
proteins to put it in a form that can be

832
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,120
used more as an ingredient versus you

833
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,480
know a finished product so you know I

834
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,839
don't think anyone fully appreciates how

835
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,319
much soy protein is in you know the the

836
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,038
US consumer's diet most most to be

837
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,398
because we don't see it in the or we

838
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,359
don't always look at it in the

839
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:06,119
ingredient list but it's in a lot of

840
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,199
things so um there's a huge Market base

841
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,879
there for us um we do know that we

842
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,200
complement P protein and in in the amino

843
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,200
acid profiles and so can we create an

844
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,159
ingredient and put it in a you know for

845
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,360
a functional form that um allows us to

846
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,120
get on the back of more labels so some

847
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,319
examples of success you might have heard

848
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,079
Elmhurst has done like teram me they've

849
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,240
done creamers and sour cream

850
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,278
Alternatives nepra has done some meat

851
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,798
and egg replacement um plantet based

852
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,398
food has done some ice cream and other

853
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,119
milk Replacements so I think there's a

854
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,599
lot of great companies that are trying

855
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:43,000
to break into that consumer space and

856
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,759
we're all excited and and um supportive

857
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,278
of that because we generally all are

858
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,919
want the same thing we want more people

859
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,880
consuming hemp

860
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,120
food um so talk about feed real

861
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,639
quick um we didn't go into a lot of the

862
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,119
processing but hopefully most people

863
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:00,479
generally know the the B basic

864
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,678
processing for grain um you know you get

865
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,599
clean seed in you can either run it

866
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,919
through a press for mechanical

867
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,559
extraction and you get hemp seed oil and

868
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,838
hemp cake or meal as a byproduct or you

869
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:14,519
run it through a hauling systems to you

870
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:17,039
know retrieve that um healthy hemp part

871
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,559
and then your H PS are your co-products

872
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,918
and in both scenarios those co-products

873
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,358
right now don't have a lot of

874
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:24,918
applications in human food and so it's

875
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,759
really important for us to be looking at

876
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:29,960
alternative valuable markets that's not

877
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,679
uncommon right most crops and

878
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,240
commodities have this same problem where

879
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,358
not everything can go into the food

880
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,039
market and so having the access to the

881
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,159
Feed Market is really important for

882
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,440
growth of any

883
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,838
commodity um what does the feed

884
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,720
consumption generally look like um so

885
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,799
this is you know sort of what is the

886
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,838
animal feed diet sort of consisting of

887
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
right now I struggled soybean meal and

888
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,239
canola meal because that's where I think

889
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,200
we can compete um and so it's not

890
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,639
insignificant um we're definitely not

891
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,439
chasing corn and so I like to remind

892
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,759
people like we're not here to compete

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,599
against corn and soy you know this isn't

894
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
us trying to take the big bad boys out

895
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,359
but um how can we complement the

896
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,599
existing feed chain and sort of found

897
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:15,039
find other value propositions um we

898
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,680
don't have a huge market in terms of

899
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,239
process capabilities we don't have the

900
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,679
infrastructure to really compete on

901
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,519
those volumes anyways um but we need to

902
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:26,358
start working towards

903
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,320
that this is just sort of a snapshot of

904
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,358
you know how how many tons of product

905
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,838
we're talking so back to my comment of

906
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,559
you know we're really not in a space as

907
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:37,119
an industry right now to to service any

908
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,119
of these um uh markets right now today

909
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,280
by ourselves anyways so we want to

910
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,760
position ourselves as a complimentary

911
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,680
ingredient um you know whether it's from

912
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,160
a nutritional perspective or a pricing

913
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:50,399
perspective um but making sure that you

914
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,519
know people are very aware and demanding

915
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,519
for higher quality protein sources him

916
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,079
can check that box um there's an

917
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,960
increased awareness of fatty acid

918
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,240
profiles and what it does for gut health

919
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
and um you know the just the animal

920
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,598
overall health so hemp can check that

921
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,358
box too and then we have renewable

922
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,960
resources you know wool and hair is one

923
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,440
that's talked about here for um some

924
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,119
other things but hemp with what we can

925
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,880
do with with the fiber the residual

926
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,280
fiber um also helps offset some of those

927
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,640
um impacts as

928
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,839
well so the hempy Coalition is a mission

929
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,000
driven company it's 501c3 sorry not

930
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,759
company but organization a lot of great

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,239
members on there um want to highlight

932
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,800
the great work that they did um we

933
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,719
achieved the first uh successful

934
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,599
application for an AFCO ingredient

935
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:40,399
definition for those who are not aware

936
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,838
um the FDA has two arms a food human

937
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,519
food arm and then a um an animal feed

938
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:48,719
arm they've been working with um State

939
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,759
Regulators in AFCO and there's more

940
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,759
restrictions on animal feed than there

941
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,319
are human food mostly because um you

942
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,040
know this is people's livelihood their

943
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:58,920
their livestock how they they make a

944
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,800
living and also animals don't really

945
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,480
have a choice what they eat a lot of

946
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,000
times you know um species will eat the

947
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,960
same thing every day all day for their

948
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,639
whole life and so there needs to be a

949
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,720
lot of scrutiny and thought put into

950
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,838
those their nutrition to make sure we're

951
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,078
putting them in the best position

952
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:17,039
possible to be successful um so that's

953
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,480
why it was pretty lengthy process took

954
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:23,039
us about three and a half years close to

955
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,679
$300,000 um we will be listed as an

956
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,639
official ingredient in the next op um

957
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,598
there's one more vote in August but

958
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,879
we've passed the last five we've got one

959
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,599
more to go there are states that are

960
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,400
recognizing the tentative ingredient

961
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,838
definition right now um it did require

962
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,318
us that we completed two different large

963
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:43,358
scale feed studies we had to establish

964
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,920
and defend a method for cannaboid

965
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,440
analysis and then we had to recommend

966
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,720
contaminant levels for canabo as well

967
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,519
but huge milestone for the industry um I

968
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:57,039
did want to highlight the um langing hen

969
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,639
study because one is the only ingredient

970
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,400
improved but also just the great things

971
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:05,118
that we see um from hemp and why laying

972
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,960
hens are a Target species for us so

973
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,480
here's sort of a breakdown of hemp seed

974
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,119
cake versus other feed ingredients you

975
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,599
can sort of see the highlights from an

976
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,280
amino acid

977
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,519
level um this is the fatty acid profile

978
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,319
so we talk about that Omega 6 to3 ratio

979
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,559
which is so important um for metabolism

980
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,920
and for inflammation responses so you

981
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,759
can see you know very competitive

982
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,960
there and then the awesome thing is that

983
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,520
that same correlation we saw in the eggs

984
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,318
and so you can see those numbers going

985
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,280
down as the percent of hemp seed cake

986
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:41,159
concentrate was in introduced into the

987
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,760
laying H you see that Omega ratio going

988
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,159
down so on the bottom there um is sort

989
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,240
of talking about dietary Health um I

990
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,799
took these slides from um Dr Raj Cula

991
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:54,159
he's one of our hfc board members he was

992
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,480
the chief scientist on this study and so

993
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,559
um give him all the credit for the work

994
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
that they did there with your feeds

995
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,838
happy to share more but it's just it's

996
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,200
encouraging to see that that um value

997
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:07,480
proposition that we see in the

998
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,399
ingredient translated into the egg as

999
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,159
well and then another surprising um

1000
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,400
benefit we also see was an increase in

1001
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,838
ltin content which um you know we should

1002
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,760
care about ltin is a a critical compound

1003
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,880
that we um see playing a role with Eye

1004
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,920
Health and so if we can also bring that

1005
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,640
value proposition to the eggs and I

1006
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,920
think consumers will be excited about

1007
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,799
that

1008
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,480
um so generally um this is sort of like

1009
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,400
the Matrix of why we think hemp has hemp

1010
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,358
seed meal has such a great potential as

1011
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,760
a feed ingredient you we looked at the

1012
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:42,440
nutrient profile and the

1013
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,480
anti-nutritional factors we had to

1014
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,838
assess safety um it's palatability we

1015
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,880
had a check for Health and Welfare um

1016
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,000
you know making sure that there wasn't

1017
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,318
any concerns there sourcing processing

1018
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,159
availability and economics are all

1019
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:56,679
things we're working on right as an

1020
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,960
industry because we're still pretty

1021
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:01,719
small um we don't necessarily have the

1022
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,318
economies of scale to compete um and may

1023
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:06,239
not have the availability that some of

1024
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:08,318
these you know um production hen houses

1025
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,199
are looking for um but those are all

1026
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,759
things that I think just we continue to

1027
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,318
chip away at as the industry grows and

1028
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,200
it was a huge ability for us to get that

1029
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:19,000
AFCO approval right we really couldn't

1030
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,960
start opening these doors until that

1031
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,599
happened so that happened in August of

1032
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,559
2024 again some states recognize it some

1033
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,680
haven't so we really even have sort of

1034
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,759
just have a foot in the door right now

1035
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,399
um I think once that vote happens this

1036
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,119
coming August you know that will be wide

1037
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,680
open for folks

1038
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,760
so um want to highlight becoming an hfc

1039
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:43,000
member you know hfc's goal is to get

1040
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,480
more applications submitted this is how

1041
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,039
we open up more um markets domestically

1042
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,280
so you sort of the breakdown of

1043
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,519
membership um we do have a great uh

1044
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,920
value proposition in Our member zone we

1045
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,480
sort of correlate and combine all of the

1046
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,838
research studies that are out there we

1047
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,960
provide an executive summary um quick

1048
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,480
access on our member zone um online so

1049
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
if you want to research you want to say

1050
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,639
hey I want to look at you know what

1051
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,519
research is out there for um hemp Pauls

1052
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,118
with swine you know we'll pull that

1053
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,318
together for you and have an executive

1054
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,358
summary and then access to um any

1055
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,159
Publications that might be out there so

1056
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:20,239
it's always a work in progress

1057
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,199
fundamentally you know all of our

1058
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,039
funding goes to supporting research um

1059
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,598
we've written grants we've been um you

1060
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,880
know included on on other feed

1061
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,200
opportunities you guys are going to hear

1062
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,880
from a couple folks later in other

1063
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:34,879
webinars about studies that are going on

1064
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,960
and and then we have to prepare the

1065
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,480
applications which you know takes time

1066
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,599
and um is taken sometimes even takes a

1067
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,039
consultant to do some um safety studies

1068
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,000
for us and so all that takes time and

1069
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,679
energy and money but it's so critical

1070
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,639
for the growth of the industry I I

1071
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,078
really can't highlight that enough um

1072
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,920
just to be able to have those markets

1073
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,240
available to us so please let me know if

1074
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,400
you're interested we'd love to have you

1075
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,879
in participating as hfc

1076
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,519
member so I think I gave us 15 minutes

1077
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,400
um for questions I never know what

1078
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,440
people want to hear um but you guys can

1079
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,519
obviously reach out to me and then happy

1080
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,519
to take questions now as well

1081
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,800
so all right got a

1082
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,119
few

1083
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,839
um one question is what has been your

1084
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,519
Farmers experience with noil um we've

1085
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,480
done really well with noil up here

1086
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:31,159
obviously having the right um the right

1087
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,440
equipment is really imperative so a lot

1088
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,279
of our guys out here you know have

1089
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,760
different types of H drills or other

1090
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,880
drills um that work with it that seed to

1091
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,160
soil contact is really important

1092
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,160
sometimes we'll have um uneven emergence

1093
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,879
in the in the furrow if that isn't

1094
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,838
managed well if you have too much um

1095
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,280
residual from the L crop or things like

1096
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,519
that but generally speaking um we

1097
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,880
definitely have success with no till no

1098
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,719
till um

1099
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,119
operations hope that answered that um

1100
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:04,118
recommendations for how to deal with

1101
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,599
bird pressure it's a great question um

1102
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:07,039
generally speaking I think people say

1103
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,000
when the birds are there it's time to

1104
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,759
harvest there's you know a few Creative

1105
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,119
Solutions that some Farmers have come up

1106
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,520
with with like scarecrows and like fire

1107
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,400
cannons and stuff um I don't know if I

1108
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,719
would say there's a silver bullet out

1109
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,240
there him um definitely attracts birds

1110
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,598
so for any of you know Avid bird Hunters

1111
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,479
I always say it's a great crop to put in

1112
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,240
um you'll see doves in there pheasants

1113
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,639
things like that um it's more

1114
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,519
challenging in regions that are

1115
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,118
surrounded by you know um shrubs or

1116
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:40,960
trees you know I've been to New Zealand

1117
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,358
and some other places you know the UK

1118
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,240
you guys have more um sort of paddocks

1119
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:48,639
that are surrounded by these these trees

1120
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,358
that are full of of birds we're

1121
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,838
fortunate here you know we're just the

1122
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,838
you know big old M Montana Sky we don't

1123
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,960
have that we'll have you know thousands

1124
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,039
of Acres at a time without any sort of

1125
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,480
interruption and so bird pressure is a

1126
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,838
little bit different so unfortunately I

1127
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,318
don't have an answer but generally if

1128
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,960
you can get in and harvest um that's the

1129
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,960
best way to to get the birds

1130
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,240
out um so the leftover plant material

1131
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,598
after we harvest the seed head the

1132
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,879
question is what does indm do with that

1133
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,960
um most of the

1134
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,960
time we do let it R you know rting is a

1135
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,440
really important um aspect you know

1136
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,079
that's a whole another conversation for

1137
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,679
fiber but generally we want to see that

1138
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,680
plant start to

1139
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:38,318
break did I get cut

1140
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,000
off okay am I

1141
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,239
back

1142
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,440
yes all right uh I guess I'll just keep

1143
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:49,000
going but um so back to the leftover

1144
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,639
yeah we do um we will purchase that

1145
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,119
residual Straw from Growers and then run

1146
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,039
it through our cortication facility it's

1147
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,880
almost strictly straw material so that's

1148
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:01,480
that bass fiber and heard we don't have

1149
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,720
any um Leaf material left it's all um

1150
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,760
usually by then it's it's dried up and

1151
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,879
broken down in the field and so it's

1152
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,880
just it's strictly that um that stock

1153
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,480
material a great question um we'd love

1154
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,760
to to partner with more researchers um

1155
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,079
the key is just starting the

1156
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,480
relationship with um FDA CBM and AFCO

1157
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,839
early on and so for like our ruminant

1158
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,480
application we're going through a

1159
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,599
pre-submission process

1160
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,519
where we basically um pull together all

1161
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:36,400
existing published research review it

1162
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:40,639
with them and then identify any gaps in

1163
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,240
the research so for example um with the

1164
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,960
with the laying hin study there was

1165
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,118
definitely research that was published

1166
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,559
outside of the United States um there

1167
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,119
was good research talking about you know

1168
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,359
palatability and nutritional

1169
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,000
opportunities but none of the studies

1170
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,719
had really dove into the potential

1171
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,920
cannaboid transference into the eggs and

1172
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,199
that was fda's main concern and so we

1173
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,519
had to work with um a private research

1174
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,239
group with the the we the Winger feed

1175
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:10,159
company and um tailored that feed study

1176
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,118
to answer that question specifically so

1177
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,159
I think that anything is great and we

1178
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,880
get to start but working with hfc early

1179
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,118
on um and and sort of mapping out what

1180
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,640
uh you know research objectives haven't

1181
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,599
been addressed yet is the best place to

1182
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,440
start and then hopefully we can design a

1183
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,920
protocol to meet those things for an

1184
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,920
application

1185
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:34,639
um question about developing single

1186
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,800
variety for both seed and fiber I don't

1187
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,639
quite know what the question is but

1188
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,839
there definitely are varieties out there

1189
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:44,400
that um you know tout that they're both

1190
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:46,920
a a true dual crop which I don't I don't

1191
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,800
necessarily disagree with but what we

1192
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,079
tell our Farmers is if you're growing

1193
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,318
first seed um that is your primary

1194
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:59,400
harvested material it it is it takes the

1195
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:01,400
most care and um attention your fiber

1196
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,639
residual is your byproduct and when you

1197
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,920
just look at the economics of it it's a

1198
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,879
no-brainer you're going to get 90% of

1199
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,400
your Revenue off of the seed harvested

1200
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,358
not the fiber um and so a true dual crop

1201
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,599
model you know it's yes it can be done

1202
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:18,199
and varieties are doing it but I we

1203
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,720
always tell them to focus first on the

1204
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:23,399
seed that's the higher value crop that's

1205
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:27,078
what needs more attention to detail um

1206
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,720
and making sure it fits your operation

1207
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,280
um we definitely collaborate with

1208
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,480
academic researchers and universities

1209
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,920
we're always open um you know off the

1210
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,920
cuff we're part of the um far

1211
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,760
consortiums that's Cornell University of

1212
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,240
Kentucky andc State um we do work with

1213
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,960
Montana State here and then a handful of

1214
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,078
others I'm always super excited to hear

1215
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,240
what people are going on it's I

1216
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,880
definitely don't have a pulse on

1217
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,239
everything and so if you guys want to

1218
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,800
work with us or you know from Agronomy

1219
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,279
to food and feed um we would love to

1220
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,480
participate and know more about what's

1221
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,480
going on

1222
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,440
um question about Stinger listed on work

1223
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:07,039
what not to follow um I will try to pull

1224
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,280
up

1225
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,639
my herbicides list real quick so I can

1226
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,839
make sure I'm telling you the right

1227
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,000
thing

1228
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:20,679
um so Stinger is a burndown that's used

1229
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,920
for broadleaf here in our region and so

1230
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:26,199
um we know that it works we just know

1231
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:29,280
that it's not labeled for hemp to follow

1232
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:31,960
um SP charge is another one that is on

1233
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,880
the other side is we know um is a is a

1234
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,960
really um effective herbicide for a lot

1235
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,960
of broad leaves but there is carryover

1236
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,920
issues and so we like we're really um we

1237
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,639
follow the label very similar to Canola

1238
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,639
and some other you know broad leafes out

1239
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:47,799
here in oil seeds will follow their

1240
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:49,358
recommendations for um plant back

1241
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,200
periods and stuff like

1242
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,759
that and I am not our agronomist so if

1243
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,159
you want to talk to our agronomist I

1244
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,520
will put you in contact with him um he

1245
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,039
definitely knows far more about what

1246
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,920
chemistries we we use and don't use and

1247
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,798
those sort of

1248
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,880
things um anticipate approval for live

1249
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:11,159
stock uh we definitely are still I would

1250
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,760
say 18 to 24 months out for getting

1251
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,960
approval we're trying to do some more

1252
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,440
creative applications to see if we can

1253
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,599
group more uh species together so this

1254
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,639
ruminant application will be large and

1255
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,920
small ruminants we're waiting on some

1256
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,000
key data be to be analyzed from a lamb

1257
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,639
study that c State University did a few

1258
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,400
years ago um but that's sort of the the

1259
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,879
last step for information before we

1260
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,720
finish that

1261
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,119
application um question about if we're

1262
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:42,239
developing construction materials for

1263
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,280
hemp in the future we definitely um you

1264
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,239
know support right now um one of the

1265
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,480
larger material construction companies

1266
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:51,798
um in the US that are doing a badend

1267
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,480
instulation replacement that's where a

1268
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,318
lot of our bass fiber is going to

1269
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,960
applications like that I definitely see

1270
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,679
a opportunity um and hope we're active

1271
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,400
in ASM and other things that are looking

1272
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,480
at hemp creete and you know the

1273
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,920
materials that are used there um I'm

1274
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,480
naturally a little more just measured in

1275
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,798
my optimism as far as timing you know

1276
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,960
construction is is challenging there's

1277
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:18,079
so many uh regulations and approvals

1278
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,000
that you need and um you need to

1279
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,880
obviously prove its efficacy uh we don't

1280
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,199
want to put people in houses that aren't

1281
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,880
made to to last and withstand um so I

1282
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,838
think it's a great place for us to focus

1283
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,079
and continue to SP research dollars and

1284
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,239
there's some great companies that we

1285
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:38,119
partner with and it could be a real game

1286
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:40,639
Cher for hemp as a um as a material

1287
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:45,440
so all right I think I covered all the

1288
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:47,519
questions in the Q&amp;A I hope oh um other

1289
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,159
than diesel tractors which parts of the

1290
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:53,280
business presses use most energy um

1291
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,480
definit so we've done an LCA of our our

1292
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,200
Cradle to gate so essentially looking at

1293
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,920
our carbon footprint as an organization

1294
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:04,318
and um the biggest uh footprint is

1295
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,599
definitely on the Agronomy side um in

1296
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:10,159
terms of fertilizer usage and like you

1297
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:12,240
said uh fuel for any of the equipment

1298
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,440
but that's inherent to like all

1299
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,679
agricultural production we definitely

1300
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,960
can find and like continue to optimize

1301
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:21,399
those things um finding partners that

1302
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,599
are closer by to reduce those Footprints

1303
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,119
um but we're aware of that but like

1304
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,838
fertilizer is a great example you know

1305
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,358
we don't have a lot of control over that

1306
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:31,279
but finding the varieties that can work

1307
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,078
reduce fertilizer needs you know that

1308
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,839
has an overall impact in our carbon

1309
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,359
footprint when it comes to the facility

1310
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,920
um it is energy intensive in terms of

1311
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:43,920
what our electrical usages you know air

1312
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,079
handling is probably our biggest um our

1313
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,760
biggest Motors and electrical use users

1314
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:51,920
um we do have you know it is a

1315
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,799
mechanical process to separate the bast

1316
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,240
and herd um from one another grain is

1317
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:58,798
not as bad um I would say the air

1318
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,358
handling equipment associated with

1319
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:02,880
cleaning the seeds probably where we see

1320
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:07,639
the biggest need and then um probably

1321
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,640
our mechanical um presses after that

1322
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
so um what about using Industrial Hemp

1323
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:15,078
for cleaning the soil and

1324
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,798
air um so I don't can't speak to it in

1325
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:19,318
any detail generally though we you know

1326
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:21,880
because we know hemp is so good at

1327
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,880
sequestering Carbon um and it's it's

1328
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,318
plant cycle that you know we know

1329
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,318
photosynthesis does some great things

1330
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,358
and because of how quickly it can grow

1331
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,679
and just vigorous of a plant it is I

1332
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:33,759
definitely think it's it's doing

1333
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,960
something there so I don't want to speak

1334
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,400
out of turn but I think anything you

1335
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,000
know anything that we can plant and see

1336
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,240
and and then reutilize for other

1337
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,559
opportunities is awesome as

1338
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,159
well um ongoing research in New York or

1339
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,880
the US related to Rehabilitation

1340
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,879
Rehabilitation of brownfields um great

1341
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,640
question my dad actually got us into

1342
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,440
hemp um he's a uh geologist in envir

1343
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,239
Mentalist background did a lot of work

1344
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,240
on Brownfield sites and so he got

1345
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:05,798
interested in him because of its ability

1346
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:07,639
to fight or remediate the soil we have

1347
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:11,199
been engaged with some studies we did

1348
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:14,239
work with Idaho University um looking at

1349
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:16,358
lead uptake um with plants we definitely

1350
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,838
see that hemp does does some great

1351
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:21,838
things it's interesting to see where

1352
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:24,000
those heavy metals um even hydrocarbons

1353
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,039
and radionucleotides sort of end up in

1354
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,480
the plant it does do a good job of

1355
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,400
protecting ing you know its DNA from um

1356
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,880
from the seed so a lot of those um

1357
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,480
compounds you don't find them in the

1358
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,400
seed themselves but you'll find residual

1359
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,000
in the stock material I know

1360
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,639
Pennsylvania um is really interested

1361
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,159
they've been looking at hemp to you know

1362
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,920
work with some um recovered you know

1363
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:48,039
coal mines or or other things where we

1364
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,079
have soil issues so um we're working

1365
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:52,798
with an oil company there's a an oil

1366
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,440
field uh excuse me an old abandoned oil

1367
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:57,000
refinery in Northeast Montana that we've

1368
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,519
been working on for

1369
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,719
almost a decade and trying to work with

1370
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,000
them and incorporating hemp as part of

1371
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:06,318
our uh Rehabilitation and Remediation

1372
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,639
plan so another awesome thing about hemp

1373
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,960
that we hope to see grow in the

1374
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:15,480
future I think that's it hopefully I

1375
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,318
covered it all um and you guys have my

1376
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,719
email if I missed anything but feel free

1377
