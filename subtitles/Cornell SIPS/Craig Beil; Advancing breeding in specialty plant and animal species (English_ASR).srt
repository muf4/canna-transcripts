1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,919
University thanks yeah so we're I'm with

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,359
breeding Insight we're under biotech

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,160
we're just up Tower Road next to the

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,559
Boyce Thompson Institute uh in a small

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,278
building that that you probably haven't

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,799
noticed before but but we're on we're on

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,359
campus if you're looking for us um so

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,160
yeah super excited to share the work

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,000
that the team does at breeding Insight

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,799
borrowed a lot of SL from people and

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,799
we'll get to talk through these

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,320
activities say so overview uh definitely

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,640
spend a little bit of time explaining

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,759
what breeding Insight is why why we were

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,120
founded um what we're working on uh go

17
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,399
into some specific examples of genomics

18
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,839
projects and how we're assisting

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,000
breeders talk about some bioinformatics

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,680
results uh talk a little bit about some

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,640
of the image analysis projects that

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,159
we've worked on with breeders talk a

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,280
little bit about Delta breed which is

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,198
our database management platform and

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,599
then I've got a couple uh miscellaneous

26
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:07,399
topics at the end so breeding Insight

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,679
the mission that we were given was to

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,359
help transform breeding by enabling the

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,759
implementation of genomic insight and

30
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,840
selection as part of routine specialty

31
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,319
crop and livestock breeding across all

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,520
of USDA

33
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,199
ARS so I think what people at USDA AR

34
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,078
were seeing and what we've discovered

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,320
working with a lot of specialty species

36
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,679
is that a lot of the challenges in corn

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,959
and soybean a lot of the tools and items

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,159
that have been deployed aren't readily

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,118
transferable to Specialty species in a

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,880
one toone capacity and I think this uh

41
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,759
list kind of shows that with corn and

42
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,640
soybean you've got very clear full

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,200
mechanization um we're working looking

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,478
just at two annual species we've got

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,759
functional diploids we just have to deal

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,118
with seed components seed planting a lot

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,959
of commercial breeders are in the space

48
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,680
primarily focused on high yields and you

49
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,559
get to have dry Harvest if you try

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,560
transfer that list over to blueberry and

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,519
lettuce it falls apart pretty quick so

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,080
again trying to how do how do we create

53
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,000
tools how do we adapt these tools and

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,040
service breeders when this is not the

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,280
conventional list of things that have

56
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,519
been made for corn and

57
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,919
soybean all right so the Breeders that

58
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,519
we work with breeders are tasked and

59
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:26,000
asked to do a whole lot of things so to

60
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,759
have a successful program to make good

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,959
progress right you've got to have good

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,199
breeding program management a lot of

63
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,400
good field data collection tools store

64
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,518
your traits properly manage all your

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,879
samples whether that's DNA samples

66
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,080
tissue samples uh seed samples again can

67
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,199
you work within the USDA germ plasm

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,599
Banks to bring in new and novel genetic

69
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,238
diversity identify new traits that are

70
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,919
plaguing your Growers um storing your

71
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,599
genetic data perform genetic analyses

72
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,518
and then make all those decisions and

73
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,759
Report out so I know so breeding's not a

74
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,400
sole Enterprise I don't think any single

75
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,639
person can do all of this

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,360
so what we're really looking at doing is

77
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,359
how can you create a good team so I

78
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,599
think any breeder today would say I

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,280
would love to have a great

80
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,878
bioinformaticist I'd love to have

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,039
somebody who's knowledgeable of genomics

82
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,560
I'd love to have a good statistician and

83
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,318
I maybe I'd like to have a software

84
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,439
developer to help connect and build new

85
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:24,119
tools to serve my program so to provide

86
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,519
this for every species for every breeder

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,879
across USDA ARS would be extremely

88
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,200
challenging and extremely cost

89
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,399
prohibitive

90
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,759
right so where breeding Insight kind of

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,200
fits within this scheme um again there's

92
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,000
a lot of basic research that comes out

93
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,438
super new

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,759
techniques uh new research coming out

95
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,359
all the time plant and animal breeders

96
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,959
as I just showed on the list before

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
they're tasked with a whole bunch of

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,239
other things they don't always have time

99
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,438
to go figure out the newest software

100
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,719
figure out the newest genomic thing is

101
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,359
it going to disrupt their current

102
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,479
workflow so that's where we kind of uh

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,079
fit in is kind of looking over at the

104
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,719
basic research hearing directly from

105
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,920
plant and animal breeders what are their

106
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,199
needs what are their challenges and help

107
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,318
ease that technology adoption into their

108
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,598
program so if they say I want to start

109
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,319
using genetic markers in my program

110
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,159
that's great let's talk about what you

111
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,439
want to use them for how many do you

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
want to deploy how are you going to use

113
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,160
it all right now let's show you a suite

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
of genomic tools that might be a good

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,919
fit for you let's talk price let's just

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,639
kind of narrow down the search space for

117
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,279
you so you're not wasting your time

118
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,639
chasing a bunch of different different

119
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,638
things that disrupt your current

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,000
workflow let's give you a really high

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,319
probability of success for what you

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,038
want all right so a little bit more

123
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,240
about who we are so again we are a USDA

124
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,159
AAS funded initiative we're located at

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Cornell University we are Cornell

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,280
employees so that's really nice at the

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,160
moment uh we're we connect and build

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,159
resources for specialty crop and

129
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,720
livestock breeders so we'll talk

130
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,360
examples for both um and as I just

131
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,639
mentioned we really picture ourselves as

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
a service and Technology transfer model

133
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,759
again just helping provide additional

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,240
support to USDA specialty breeding

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,600
programs um and I know I'll focus a lot

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,000
on science team developments but want to

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,320
highlight that we're a team made up of

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,319
scientists as well as software

139
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,079
developers all right so a little bit

140
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,038
about uh what our growth has been like

141
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,038
since 2018 so the idea of starting

142
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,439
breeding insight and the Inception came

143
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,639
in 2018 we got our first group of

144
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,600
species in 2019 so there's the six

145
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,319
species trout salmon alphalpha grape

146
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,479
blueberry and sweet potato that

147
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,280
represented about 15 breeding programs

148
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:45,199
across the USDA ARS in 2022 we got 10

149
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,239
new species pictured down at the bottom

150
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,879
and also the formation of reading

151
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,400
Insight so this is a a group doing

152
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,279
similar work to what we're doing but

153
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,599
they're primarily focused down in the

154
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,198
Southeast um and they have a slightly

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,000
different uh research model than we do

156
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,840
in 2024 we got got 11 new species

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,959
pictured on the right and that brings us

158
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,079
up to supporting around 51 breeders and

159
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,038
breeding programs across the

160
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,399
US

161
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,439
right so here's kind of what it looks

162
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,279
like uh where all those breeding

163
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,598
programs are located so you can see

164
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,159
we've got some high capacity over in the

165
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,560
Pacific Northwest in Corvalis Oregon as

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,080
well as proster Washington also quite a

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,918
bit of capacity in Madison Wisconsin a

168
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,639
number of species there and then a

169
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,159
decent number in Beltsville Maryland so

170
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,038
really the idea is build some capacity

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,759
at uh Cornell University and then we can

172
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,598
serve as kind of surge support for

173
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,439
bioinformatics genomics phenotyping

174
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:45,680
software development to these breeding

175
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,959
programs across the US um one of the

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,360
things that's really fun with working

177
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,079
with all these different species is

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,199
we'll hear of a solution or a challenge

179
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,198
in something like trout and then we'll

180
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
hear a similar thing in cranberry and

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,038
take a tool from trout and be able to

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,918
apply it in Cranberry where those those

183
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,519
two groups would never meet at a typical

184
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,159
conference or or discuss these ideas so

185
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,878
we sit at kind of an interesting spot

186
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,240
hearing a lot of uh just breeding

187
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,720
technology that's coming through and we

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,598
help funnel and distribute that

189
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,599
information out to other

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,199
groups all right so that was a little

191
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,240
bit about breeding Insight let's talk

192
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,680
about some of the other things that

193
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,319
we're working on um so one of the big

194
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,360
challenges that we are set out to do

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,680
with looking at our species portfolio is

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,720
we can't constantly be building one off

197
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,918
solutions for every species or every

198
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,879
program that we work with so talking

199
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,159
with breeders working with breeders a

200
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,319
lot of the challenges are the same but

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,039
trying to figure out what is a common

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,199
Solution that's going to work across all

203
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,439
those species is a challenge but that's

204
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,560
what we're working on and I think we're

205
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,158
making good progress uh identifying a

206
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,879
number of tools and services that work

207
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,360
in that capacity so again what we refer

208
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,000
to this is kind of creating species

209
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
agnostic tools can we identify something

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,839
that can help breeders perform their own

211
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
bioinformatics regardless of the pyy

212
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,679
level of the species regardless of the

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,840
marker platform that they're using if a

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,120
species says they want to use genotyping

215
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,519
can we find one good genotyping provider

216
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,598
that can fit the needs for all the

217
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,038
species that we're working with same

218
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,878
with phenotyping can we find something

219
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:22,439
that works on berries and also works on

220
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,759
leaves and also works on Roots kind of

221
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,439
simpler simpler Solutions and then the

222
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,360
database management that's the same

223
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,319
component can we find a way for breeders

224
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,879
to store data for annual

225
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,918
as well as perennials for things that

226
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,879
are um at the plot level things are at

227
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,799
the plant

228
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:43,278
level just really try to create species

229
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,679
agnostic tools across all of these

230
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,559
species right we'll go into some

231
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,719
specific genotyping Services tools and

232
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,679
projects um so here's what I talked

233
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,200
about the challenges with genetics

234
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,359
looking at all the species that we work

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,320
with so we're going all the way from Aid

236
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,639
diploid system in honey B through a lot

237
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,440
of diploids with some of them having sex

238
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,039
chromosomes and then we've also got some

239
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,800
in fish breeding they will change the

240
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,838
Sexes of the fish periodically so that's

241
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,000
that's a fun Challenge and then if you

242
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,480
can look across our polyploid species

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,600
we've got tetrols all the way up to 12x

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,639
species and not always 12x sometimes

245
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,120
other things so um I think as as we keep

246
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,078
looking at this stuff it it keeps

247
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
getting more complicated and some people

248
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,759
say more

249
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
fun all right so some additional

250
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,799
challenges with with polyploids is that

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,800
um you usually don't have a high quality

252
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,159
reference genome due to the complexity

253
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,559
of the genome it's hard to get accurate

254
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,399
dosage calling and it's hard to phase

255
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,119
the markers especially for polyplay

256
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,679
species so those are some of the

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,159
challenges that we're

258
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,039
facing right so kind of that species

259
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,039
agnostic tool that I talked

260
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,519
about we've identified Dart uh diversity

261
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,360
array technology as a company in

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,919
Australia that's working really well to

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
fit a lot of the needs and requests that

264
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:07,679
we have um so this is our current model

265
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,399
I'll talk about the marker technology

266
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,879
from them on the next slide but uh

267
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,600
breeders that come to us that say they

268
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,200
want to do genotyping we'll work with

269
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,200
them to create a species specific marker

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,800
panel and then the breeders in this

271
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,278
equation are they're doing the tissue

272
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,359
collection on site so we work with them

273
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,838
to provide best practices what's the

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,959
plastic where they need to do how do

275
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,880
they ship it how much to collect what

276
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,958
are they working with um we help them

277
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,799
with the shipping to Australia which um

278
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,078
again they've got strict borders for

279
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,519
bringing in outside material uh the Gen

280
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,120
the DNA extraction is also done at darts

281
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,959
that's about $2 a sample which is great

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,919
and the actual genotyping depending on

283
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,199
the species $9 to11 so pretty low cost

284
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,319
pretty high throughput um darts been

285
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,440
great to work with and that genotyping

286
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,399
data can come directly to us so we can

287
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,720
help the Breeders QC the data and

288
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,360
perform any early bioinformatics Anis

289
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,839
that they need and then we can push that

290
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,360
back to them and then they can make

291
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,360
direct breeding decisions with the

292
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:12,399
data right so just a little bit about

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,839
the dart tag um is the technology that

294
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,600
we're using that's the uh so it's a

295
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,680
targeted genotyping by sequencing

296
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,800
platform based on this padl technology

297
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,078
uh featured on the right so we can

298
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,919
Target any snip or smart small indel um

299
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,359
into the dart tag panel

300
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,278
um uh typically we're making the marker

301
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,120
panels to Target 3,000 Loi um that's

302
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,600
within a single primer pool um and

303
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,399
what's nice about the technologies that

304
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,200
were allowed to force in any major qtl

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,559
or markers used in markers assistance

306
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,560
selection that the Breeders are already

307
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,278
incorporated into their breeding program

308
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,799
so we can force those in and then we try

309
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,078
to round out the rest of the panel with

310
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,519
genome wide distribution of the markers

311
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,479
right so we're hitting the same 3,000

312
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,039
lowai every time so we get relatively

313
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,079
low missing data and we found that this

314
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,120
works plenty well for any genetic maps

315
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,319
that we want to create any qtl analysis

316
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,679
any gws and we're getting good genomic

317
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,560
prediction accuracies for most of our

318
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,559
species for most

319
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,639
traits right so yeah we've been busy

320
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,919
making a lot of marker panels um so

321
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,639
here's the list of species that we

322
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,120
currently have so we work with dart to

323
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,039
make these uh marker panels open source

324
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,600
and publicly available so if you're an

325
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,759
alphalpha breeder you can contact Dart

326
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,839
and use the same alphalpha marker panel

327
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:34,639
whether in industry or whether you're

328
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,800
USDA ARS so that data has a one to one

329
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,198
comparison um yeah so here's a number of

330
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,879
species that we've worked with here's

331
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,120
the ones that are currently in

332
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,759
development so yeah we'll have a new hot

333
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,159
marker panel coming out watermelon red

334
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,759
clover hemps being worked on with the

335
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,159
group up in Geneva and we've got uh

336
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,639
Blackberry being worked on out in the

337
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,319
Pacific Northwest um so again just to

338
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,320
reiterate what we've seen with the dark

339
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,040
tag marker technology is that we found

340
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,720
to be readily accessible um we get good

341
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,120
communication with dart the Breeders are

342
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,639
also able to easily send their samples

343
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,519
uh the data coming back is highly

344
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,120
reliable we're getting fast turnaround

345
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,919
time the price Point's quite affordable

346
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,759
High repeatability among the calls that

347
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,319
are being made and we like that it's a

348
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,360
targeted marker platform that you're

349
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,360
hitting the same 3,000

350
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,440
Loi right so little bit about the data

351
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,719
that you get when it comes back so I

352
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,079
mentioned that it's a you get targeted

353
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,278
sequencing so we're targeting a snip of

354
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,439
Interest so here we're looking at this G

355
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,639
to

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,920
a but because it's targeted sequencing

357
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,839
right now at 81 base pairs we'll also

358
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,599
pick up these off Target Snips that's

359
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,720
what we're calling them so for any uh

360
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,360
lowai we're getting additional what

361
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,639
we're calling micro types so instead of

362
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,800
just bolic snip calls at the locus we're

363
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,879
getting much more information so more

364
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,879
similar to SSR

365
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,320
markers all right so so some additional

366
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,198
information on why we like Dart tag for

367
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,519
genotyping for the species that we work

368
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,519
with again same set of lowai across all

369
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,240
projects and samples so just make

370
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,078
sharing information particularly when

371
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,919
there's multiple breeding programs for a

372
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:19,399
species um it works really well on low

373
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:21,399
quality DNA um we get low missing data

374
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,759
we get pretty good read depth at around

375
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,958
50 reads per Locus per sample um so this

376
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,600
really helps with

377
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,919
multi-state dosage calling especially

378
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,040
for autop polyploid species uh we like

379
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,000
the multi-c reads what we call

380
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,480
microhaplotypes across the target Losi

381
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,159
um and then yeah linkage Maps

382
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,199
constructed using Dart Snips can

383
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:47,639
identify some genome assembly mistakes

384
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:50,519
so we've seen this in cranberry and

385
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,079
lettuce all right so getting multiple

386
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,078
micro types per Locus means we've got a

387
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,679
whole lot of Loi and a whole lot of

388
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,239
genetic data that we need to keep track

389
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,638
of so here's some examples uh in

390
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,198
alphalpha on the upper left so again if

391
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,639
we were just looking at bolic Snips at

392
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:12,078
3,000 loai we would expect to see 6,000

393
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:14,120
Al okay we're we're identifying 32,000

394
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,919
unique microhaplotypes so coming at

395
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,959
around 10 microh types per Locus there's

396
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,278
just a lot of additional information at

397
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,838
those low side that we're targeting um

398
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,439
so we want to keep track of that we want

399
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,560
to work with our breeders keep uh

400
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,560
genotyping a number of samples see if we

401
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,719
can get kind of where do these stop um

402
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,239
how much can we capture enough diversity

403
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,600
with the single marker panel that these

404
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,399
kind of asot and we can say yeah we feel

405
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,480
like we're we've identified 90% 95% of

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,278
the genetic diversity for the low side

407
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,800
that we're looking at so across the

408
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,000
seven species that we've currently got

409
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,838
marker panels out for we've got

410
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,559
156,000

411
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,360
microhaplotypes

412
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,119
um yeah so we'll talk next about uh

413
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
setting up databases to keep track of

414
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
this information

415
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,719
right so again so here's the target

416
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,479
Snips the of Target Snips so again we're

417
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,319
working to establish the best workflows

418
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,480
for filtering and processing the Shino

419
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,278
type data as it comes in we want to

420
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,240
create file formats that work with other

421
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,240
applications for Downstream analyses so

422
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,278
we want readers to have flexibility if

423
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,198
they want to use tools that we're not

424
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,480
developing in house can we get them the

425
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,879
data file format so they can go run

426
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,120
their regular analysis that they've

427
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,838
already set

428
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,159
up um yeah and then we're trying to

429
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,959
create and test internal apps for

430
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,439
userfriendly pipelines so we're working

431
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,359
on something called hype

432
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,399
DB right so here's here's a picture of a

433
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,639
component of that hype DB so this is

434
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,318
called Hao search so this allows you to

435
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,519
query those micro types so if you find

436
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,639
if you want to look at a particular

437
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,639
Locus to see how many microhaplotypes

438
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,560
you have or if you've identified a

439
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,759
microtype associated with a major qtl

440
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:58,239
you can go in look further into that um

441
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,519
alil the microtype and look look at uh

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,400
other germ that might have that same Al

443
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,640
or qtl or you can also look across

444
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,120
projects and say um and I'm only seeing

445
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
a little bit of diversity at this one

446
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,318
low side that I have I'm seing a lot of

447
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,318
other projects have a whole lot of

448
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,078
diversity maybe I should reach out to my

449
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,000
collaborator and ask for some germ plasm

450
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,438
so I can increase diversity in this

451
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,439
targeted

452
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,678
region okay we'll shift

453
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,360
bioinformatics right so this this was a

454
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,400
fun one um alphalpha creeping rootedness

455
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,199
qtl

456
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,160
so the breeder that we were working with

457
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,319
had identified this as kind of classic

458
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,080
alphalpha kind of staying within its

459
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,038
planted row very nicely he was very

460
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,079
interested in what's going on with the

461
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,000
spreading alphalpha that he had

462
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,918
identified thinking that maybe this

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,960
would lead to increase tolerance for

464
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,440
biotic or abiotic stresses or maybe

465
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,038
there could be a niche market for

466
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
Growers who want to plant this and just

467
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,359
let the alphalpha spread in the field so

468
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,519
we genotyped an alphalpha population

469
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,158
segregating for the trait using the 3K

470
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,279
Dart tag marker panel for alphalpha uh

471
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,559
perform gwas poly within this uh big app

472
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,839
and I've got a slide I'll talk a little

473
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,599
bit more about that um but yeah we

474
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,519
identified a major qtl on chromosome 6

475
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,480
explaining this trait so we can share

476
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,720
that back to the breeder and and see

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,000
what he wants to do with

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,079
it all right next project uh genomic

479
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,880
prediction we're going to stick with

480
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,678
alphalpha here for another minute so

481
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,919
alphalpha when we started working with

482
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
them a few years ago they didn't have um

483
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,280
they really weren't using a lot of

484
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,120
genetic Tools in their analyses or in

485
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,720
their breeding programs and now that

486
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,719
they have a marker panel they're very

487
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,558
excited and they're talking about moving

488
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,839
into genomic selection um so they're

489
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,480
really interested they're kind of in the

490
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,519
testing phase right now like what

491
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,960
accuracies are we getting for our traits

492
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,038
how do we create a training uh uh panel

493
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,360
to do this and so we're we're working

494
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,079
with them to show kind of like what's

495
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,079
the diversity with with what they're

496
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,639
working with what they're starting with

497
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,439
with their training um group gr What

498
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,200
percentages do you need from all these

499
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,919
different uh subgroups to get the best

500
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,480
predictions that you have so I think

501
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,880
again a lot of other

502
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,599
species plenty of literature on this

503
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,320
alphaalpha is just coming to the table

504
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,719
now they trying trying to assist them

505
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,759
with this and we can see that we're

506
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,159
getting pretty good uh prediction

507
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,480
accuracies for things things like height

508
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,120
in their

509
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,240
program all right the next one so talked

510
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:31,439
a lot about microhaplotypes having these

511
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,839
multi multiple information per Loi so

512
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,880
thinking about can can we squeeze more

513
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,879
information using that data than just

514
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,000
bolic Snips so what kind of uh genomic

515
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,919
prediction accuracies can we get if we

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,200
actually use the micro types for

517
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,559
pedigree relatedness versus just the

518
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,440
bolic target steps so we're seeing

519
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,879
slight increases in there and we're

520
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,880
really interested in exploring that

521
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,599
more right so I talked to just alluded

522
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,599
to this big app so that stands for the

523
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,639
breeding Insight genomics app um so this

524
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:08,839
is a collaboration with the genomics and

525
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,440
bioinformatics team as well as uh other

526
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,079
key people so trying to make a our shiny

527
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
app just to make a a web-based

528
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,240
application to perform genomics and

529
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,200
bioinformatics Analysis that's easily

530
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,079
accessible somebody can use it with no

531
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,919
coding experience um it's got really

532
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,319
good integrated help we're working on

533
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,799
putting out tutorials there's help pages

534
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:31,639
online there's also click information

535
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,839
within the app to find more information

536
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,559
and hopefully you can feel confident

537
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,240
running your own analyses and then also

538
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:40,558
if you use the tool you've got the

539
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,359
citations for for what tools and and uh

540
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,960
additional applications were

541
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,158
Incorporated um and again broad support

542
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,480
we've got the ability to pick what Ploy

543
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,880
your species is within the app so

544
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,000
diploids polyploids should be able to

545
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,000
use the tool without any

546
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,640
issues okay yeah so the the basic analys

547
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,079
IES in there or again we can do dosage

548
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,000
calling uh from the files coming from

549
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,759
Dart you can look at your data using

550
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,200
pcas do some basic genetic diversity

551
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,839
analyses you can perform gws and you can

552
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,840
do genomic

553
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,559
prediction right let's talk image

554
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:22,079
phenotyping tools that we've had so this

555
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:24,200
was a sweet potato nematode project um

556
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,639
so this one was with the sweet potato

557
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,640
group down in Charleston South Carolina

558
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,960
so they

559
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,720
were doing root washes of potatoes to

560
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,440
look for which ones are most resistant

561
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:41,400
or most susceptible to nematodes um the

562
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,880
classic Model was to dilute these root

563
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,440
washes sit at the microscope for three

564
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,080
plus weeks hand counting uh the

565
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,159
nematodes on the screen um that that

566
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,720
seemed uh fairly inefficient uh they

567
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,240
reached out to us could we come up with

568
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,480
a better solution and so uh tears tears

569
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,079
in the audience and this was our first

570
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,480
application of doing machine learning

571
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,558
for image analysis um so it it worked

572
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,360
really well so you can see on this slide

573
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,399
there's still a lot of plant debris but

574
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,399
it's picking up the nematode eggs very

575
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,559
clearly from that plant debris in the

576
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,120
background um and looking down here at

577
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:21,440
the F1 scores so the models agree more

578
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,918
with uh humans per counts than one human

579
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,919
to another so pretty nice uh the

580
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,960
scalability of this again going from

581
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,840
single slides to now you can p IET 96

582
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,640
samples into a plate and then run it

583
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,959
through the machine and get get your

584
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,720
images really

585
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,798
quickly all right the next one uh this

586
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,919
was the trout image one I'm sure we've

587
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,158
got Edwin online we've also got AJ in

588
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,759
the audience so this came from the trout

589
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,200
breeder in uh Hagerman Idaho so he was

590
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,839
really interested in taking images of

591
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,080
the trout eggs following fertilization

592
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,839
to identify which ones had successful

593
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,720
fertilization versus which ones were

594
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:04,240
blank or aborted um this is you can see

595
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,079
the differences with your eye the

596
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,759
initial challenge was that the eggs are

597
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,639
quite glossy and shiny so we had to come

598
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,558
up with a Imaging system to reduce that

599
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,440
glare on those to get clear images so we

600
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,440
could actually categorize them so the

601
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,960
efficiency is that these trays with the

602
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,640
eggs sometimes have up to 7,000 eggs on

603
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,400
them and this uh machine learning model

604
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,520
will analyze it within seconds with

605
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:32,360
minimal handling um recording overnight

606
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:34,720
95% accuracy on dead vers viable um and

607
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,479
the scalability is that they worked very

608
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,240
nicely to create this very simple light

609
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,759
box and deploy that in a system that

610
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,880
needs to stay dry can't have a lot of

611
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,798
handling and just needs to be readily

612
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,799
deployed on

613
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,720
site I think this is the final one for

614
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,558
uh image projects this was potato growth

615
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,000
defects with boa so the this came out of

616
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,759
the max Feldman's potato breeding group

617
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,200
in prer Washington so he asks can we

618
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,960
segment and measure negative growth

619
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,200
traits on potato tubers so his system is

620
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,558
that he can Harvest them wash them put

621
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,400
them on a conveyor belt and then they

622
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,798
get automatically imaged and then the

623
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,000
potatoes are cropped out um so he wanted

624
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,240
to identify some negative growth traits

625
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,359
like this growth crack on the tuber and

626
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,240
then also these Sprouts that are on the

627
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:27,759
tuber um so again the efficiency is

628
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,640
hundreds to thousands of tubers can be

629
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:33,359
um individ evaluated in an automated run

630
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,080
and we're getting 90 to 94% accuracy

631
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:39,038
where this is now replacing the classic

632
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,038
1 to5 rating for negative growth

633
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,519
defects right talk a little bit about

634
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,079
the data management software called

635
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:51,158
Delta breed um so here's here's our logo

636
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:53,119
here's the name um yeah so we're we're

637
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,480
definitely trying to abide by Fair data

638
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,959
practices so make the data easily

639
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,079
findable accessible interoperable and

640
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,759
reusable

641
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,480
so we try to adhere to the community

642
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,119
standards set by brappy so that's the

643
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,720
breeding application programming

644
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,879
interface we talk extensively with Pete

645
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,159
Selby on that type of work and try to

646
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,640
stay up toate and and help uh provide

647
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,159
information back to the community when

648
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,080
we can um again the big challenge is

649
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,919
creating things that are General but

650
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,639
also can be specific to breeding

651
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,520
programs at the same time as we're

652
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,759
trying to manage a lot of different

653
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,798
species so we've recently released the

654
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,158
Delta breed version 1.0 we're

655
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,079
considering this our MVP or minimal

656
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,200
viable product so with that we know that

657
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,519
there's some we're working with pretty

658
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,519
basic features kind of data in data out

659
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,879
um there's know limitations and at the

660
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,158
moment we're trying to have a controlled

661
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,159
roll out to our breeders so we're really

662
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,760
just trying to support the USDA AR

663
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,760
breeders that are most engaged with us

664
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,158
and have the most immediate need for

665
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,319
data management

666
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,440
support um along with that again just

667
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,798
try to really help get documentation and

668
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,480
training resources in place so that they

669
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:05,798
can do additional learning and know best

670
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,759
practices right so with that some things

671
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,440
that that the system can do at the

672
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,480
moment is we can set privacy and

673
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
administration levels for each user

674
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,319
within the breeding program you can

675
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,880
upload germ plasm you can upload

676
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,678
ontology so that's the traits that

677
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,200
you're going to phenotype with you can

678
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,000
upload experiments and observation data

679
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,600
and then we've got the brappy connection

680
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,679
to to push data to field

681
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:32,038
book right so yeah users sign in using

682
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,080
their orc ID um so that your user

683
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,359
permission levels associated with that

684
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,278
information so here's an example of germ

685
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,479
plasm records so everything that comes

686
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,038
in gets a unique G the name of the germ

687
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,399
plasm and then you can track the

688
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,798
pedigree information and you can always

689
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:50,398
open and expand to see more details on

690
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,278
that

691
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:55,199
individual right uh pedigree viewer so

692
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,798
this was a bra coming out of the breed

693
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,600
base group um so this was an example of

694
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,158
zi so this was a ban release down here

695
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,678
and they wanted to track back and see

696
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,159
what were the parents and and how did

697
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,159
they get to

698
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:14,240
it right so ontology this is a again

699
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,918
phenotypes ontology what's the set

700
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,200
vocabulary that you're using to go and

701
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,080
collect phenotypes out in the field or

702
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,200
in the lab so again a shortened name

703
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,038
here you can include the full name um

704
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,278
what's the trait that you're measuring

705
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,960
what's the scale class what's the unit

706
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,599
that you're working with if you click

707
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,720
show more details you get a little bit

708
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,359
more information for what are each of

709
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,880
the values that you've set one to five

710
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,759
um so again the idea is that you're

711
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,360
providing enough information that if I

712
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,240
gave this to somebody to go out to the

713
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,719
field to score that you would feel

714
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,720
confident that they could go score

715
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,120
correctly that they're not going to

716
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,720
invert the scales or invent something

717
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,359
new so again something as simple as

718
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,600
plant height is well am I measuring it

719
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,038
in the middle of the Season am I

720
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,240
measuring it in the end of the season am

721
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,278
I measuring it to the top of the flower

722
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,359
to the flag leaf so just being very

723
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,759
clear on what's the defined vocabulary

724
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,918
and that's where we come in with the

725
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,519
trait method in

726
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,720
scale right experiments and observations

727
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,120
I think pretty classic your germ plasm

728
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,278
name there's the G that's associated

729
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,639
with that one um is this a test plot or

730
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,798
a check plot what environment are you

731
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,720
working in um what are your row and

732
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,798
column positions for that um you can set

733
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Latin long if you're using a GPS to to

734
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,038
track where those are in the field

735
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,360
a unique observation unit ID this is

736
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,879
systemwide for that uh data row and then

737
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,879
fill in and and upload your phenotype

738
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,039
data for the experiment and then

739
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,880
downloading data again you can decide am

740
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,960
I pulling all environments associated

741
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
with that experiment and what's the file

742
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
format that I would like my data to come

743
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,038
out

744
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,398
in right so the connection to fieldbook

745
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,200
um via brappy this has worked nicely

746
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:02,158
we've got a QR code on the screen for

747
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,720
your reading program um which will push

748
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,440
push the data into field books that you

749
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,240
can indicate which field you want to go

750
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,960
collect data for and upload your

751
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,319
phenotype traits as well and select

752
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,600
those and then you can go out in the

753
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:16,158
field and digitally collect your

754
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,839
phenotype data so hopefully minimal um

755
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,880
downloading the files and re-uploading

756
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,240
the files you can just scan the QR code

757
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,880
and push that using

758
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,159
brappy right so an important component

759
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,720
not to be missed in creating all of

760
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,240
these tools is also the training that

761
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,519
needs to go into it so we have a

762
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,079
Learning Hub online so people can go and

763
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,200
find this information we can create

764
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,519
links provide Sops uh plenty of Zoom

765
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,278
instructions plenty of meetings with

766
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,440
breeders to hear what are the challenges

767
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,240
uh how can we better help and when we

768
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,000
can we love to go out and have in-person

769
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,440
site visits with our breeders to really

770
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,200
hear firsthand what are they faced with

771
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,360
and and establish a good connection with

772
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,360
our

773
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,000
collaborators right additional software

774
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:01,480
demo applications so we've got YouTube

775
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,798
videos coming in uh pretty consistently

776
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,759
now to help talk about um uh the Delta

777
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,000
breed software the big app and other

778
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,240
tools that we're

779
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,119
developing okay I think we've made it

780
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,519
almost to the end just a couple fun

781
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,319
miscellaneous things to finish up so we

782
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,798
have a long list of species that we work

783
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,240
with at breeding Insight but also just

784
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,158
taking a look at what CS already works

785
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,519
with and agch up in Geneva there's about

786
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,080
50% overlap between these groups and the

787
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,038
species that we support but we also have

788
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,240
our our own set of species that that

789
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:38,398
aren't common between the two so again I

790
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,120
think we hope that there's tools and

791
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,959
services at breeding ins sight and that

792
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,239
these can be transferred over to the

793
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,519
Cornell

794
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,798
Community right just also want to take a

795
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,519
moment to highlight that breed and

796
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,558
insight in bi onramp received the 2024

797
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,638
USDA secretary honor award um so this is

798
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,119
I think category four for providing all

799
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,719
Americans safe and nutritious food uh

800
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:04,518
this was on January 10 so dong Yen got

801
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,880
to go down uh Tim Reinhardt is our uh Pi

802
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,440
representing the office of national

803
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,840
programs at the USDA and uh Kio is with

804
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,880
B on RAM so they got to go down and

805
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,558
enjoy the celebration with Tim as we won

806
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,320
this

807
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:22,000
award right final slide just want to

808
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,079
highlight uh a number of Cornell trained

809
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,960
individuals on our team who were trained

810
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:30,319
at Cornell so thank you the people who

811
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,159
helped train these uh great great people

812
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,240
um glad to have them back in the Cornell

813
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,799
Community providing more tools and

814
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,558
services and and sticking sticking their

815
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:43,200
whole careers with plant breeding and

816
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:46,038
genetics or physiology so thank you so

817
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,600
much but I think that's a pretty good

818
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:50,278
number all right and definitely a lot of

819
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:54,558
people to thank you know we have a ton

820
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:57,038
of support at the bi onramp staff the uh

821
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,480
onp a lot of people on the breeding

822
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,319
Insight team at the moment and thanks to

823
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,558
our Advisory board for helping answer

824
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,558
