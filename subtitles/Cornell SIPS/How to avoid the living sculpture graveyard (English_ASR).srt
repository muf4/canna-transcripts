3
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,079
i bet you're thinking to yourself what

4
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,118
can i do to avoid the living sculpture

5
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,239
graveyard

6
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,159
well you're in luck it's simple all you

7
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,199
need to do is some basic advanced

8
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
planning

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,719
every living sculpture project needs

10
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,879
some planning that takes into account

11
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,920
the following two principles

12
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,560
one maintenance of the sculpture

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,840
and two youth and community involvement

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
in the project

15
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,759
living sculpture is easy to create and

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,560
with a little time devoted to

17
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
maintaining it

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
each week it will be a terrific addition

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,879
to your community

20
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,798
each type of living sculpture requires

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,959
unique forms of maintenance

22
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
for example sod sculptures need to be

23
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,640
watered each day for two weeks

24
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,559
until the piece is established and then

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
weekly thereafter

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,478
once the sod has grown in they need to

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
be routinely trimmed down

28
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,840
so it's a good idea to keep on hand the

29
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
basic supplies you need

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
such as the garden hose and pruning

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
shears

32
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,759
a second critical part of your project

33
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,399
planning will be to ensure

34
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,318
youth and community involvement make

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,159
sure that you involve and engage

36
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
youth and community members in all

37
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,239
stages of the project

38
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
from planning and design to creation and

39
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,039
maintenance

40
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,719
remember that people take care of what

41
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,840
they own and of what they love

42
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,840
including living sculpture

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
if these two basic principles of

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,439
maintenance and youth and community

45
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,000
involvement

46
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,199
are taken into account in your project

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
then there's no doubt

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,958
your living sculpture will be a popular

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
thriving place to hang out in your

50
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,840
community

51
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,840
for years to come enjoy
