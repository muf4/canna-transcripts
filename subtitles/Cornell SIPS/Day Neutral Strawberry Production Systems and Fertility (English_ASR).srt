1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,160
the first speaker of the day

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:12,400
um mr simone simon is owner of

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
nova foui a strawberry and raspberry

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,199
plant nursery located in quebec

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
that specializes in plug and tray plants

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,400
he regularly visits producers and

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,920
researchers abroad

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,679
to adopt the latest techniques and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,320
transfer them to industry

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,920
simone is very much interested and very

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,518
much involved at all levels of the

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
production chain

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,039
from breeding to marketing of fruits and

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,479
he is a member of several committees and

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,000
working groups

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,159
he is currently president of the north

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
american strawberry growers association

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,159
who's hosting this webinar series and

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
sits on the coordinating board of the

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,038
quebec

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,799
strawberry grower association in order

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,439
to participate in the development of the

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,078
sector

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
and to make sure that the technological

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
developments

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,359
in the company match the market's needs

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,680
simon

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
yeah thank you very much caddy i'm very

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,558
impressed with your good uh french

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
pronunciation

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,079
i'll try to do the same in english then

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,319
i'm very pleased to be part of this day

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,319
neutral strawberry production webinar

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,000
these kinds of interactive web events

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,158
sounds really new to us but

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,519
will become a standard definitely in the

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
years to come

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,039
it will never replace any personal

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
meetings or the friendly relations that

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
we share during congresses and

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,759
conferences but

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
it really has the advantage of putting

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
together people that live far away

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,400
from each other on the same network to

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,759
discuss a particular subject

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,478
so the topic i will approach today

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
is growing systems used for day neutral

48
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,478
strawberry production

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
i will first shortly explain how danger

50
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,118
trolls are developing in north america

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720
among different climates and among other

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,159
growing systems

53
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,319
and then i will discuss the different

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
production scheme used in the northeast

55
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,039
of our continent to make day neutral

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
production

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
complementary and profitable with bare

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,479
roots or plug plants

59
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,478
so let's get started

60
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,399
as you know north america is a very vast

61
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,038
continent with a lot of climatic zones

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,639
and fortunately for us strawberries are

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
known among the most adaptable

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,039
cultivated crop that will fit well

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,719
in the most various condition so

66
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,000
acreages of strawberries

67
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,840
are grown all over the continent the

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
data you see on this slide or from

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,560
different sources and different years of

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
reference

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
so my numbers might not be all up to

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,759
date but i just want to give you a

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
general portrait

74
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,280
so you can see here some of the most

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
important production site in north

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
america

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,039
illustrated here with red circles which

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,760
are proportional to the acreage

79
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,439
eastern canada is is a big player over

80
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,280
10 000 acres

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,439
it is about the same in the north and

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,759
mid east of the united states

83
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,359
and then there is more than seven

84
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,039
thousand acres

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,160
i think now it's close to ten thousand

86
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,598
in the very south uh concentrated around

87
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,120
tampa in florida and california as close

88
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,560
to forty thousand acres

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
spread over the state so on the

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
following slide

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,800
instead of acreage you can see the

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,439
average yield

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,640
in each region therefore the scheme is

94
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,639
different

95
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,559
to explain this difference let me remind

96
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,318
you a few basics of physiology

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,158
it is really important that you all

98
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,158
understand this before we go further

99
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
remember that strawberry is a very

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
adaptable specie and it is a reason why

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
it is so fascinating to work with

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
you can crop the same plants in

103
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,598
different environment

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
and they will react in a completely

105
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,399
different manner

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
many people don't really know why summer

107
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,959
bearing strawberries are called

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,519
short day varieties so then let me

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
explain

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
it is because summer bearing varieties

111
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,399
build flower buds in the crowns

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
during the short days in fall and those

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,158
flowers will come out and bear fruit

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,799
only in the spring

115
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,759
so it is a combination of short days and

116
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
cool climate

117
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,519
that will induce flower body initiation

118
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
in short days cultivar

119
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,519
in the north this process takes place in

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
the fall

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,599
and the plants bear fruit in the spring

122
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,639
however

123
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,798
under lower latitudes like in florida

124
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,439
growing conditions are good all winter

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,239
long while the dayland stay short

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,319
so even the short day varieties that

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
normally crops only 3-4 weeks in the

128
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,879
north

129
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,560
they will give a continuous supply of

130
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,360
fruit over four or five months in the

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
south

132
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
so well this is for the short day types

133
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,839
on the other end

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
day neutral varieties will grow flower

135
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,079
bud even when the days are long and

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,479
temperatures are warm

137
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,478
so then even in northern latitudes they

138
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,159
will give a continuous production all

139
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,079
over the summer season

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,639
therefore stretching the picking season

141
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,959
from one month to five months

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,199
so let's get back again a few slides and

143
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,439
have a second look at acreage

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,520
so then let me show you again the

145
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,478
average yield that is increasing as you

146
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,918
go south

147
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,680
mainly because as i explained over

148
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,319
longer picking season

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,439
and then fasten your seat belt total

150
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,000
yield

151
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,959
here california and florida take most of

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
the screen

153
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,359
and they grow an enormous proportion of

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,519
north american strawberries

155
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,240
this is because their season is longer

156
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,719
and their yields are higher

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,038
i will always remember a conference

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,520
given by tom julian from driscoll

159
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,360
at the nasga congress who told us that

160
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,918
the only way the north could

161
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
could survive california's competition

162
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,399
is by adopting new growing systems

163
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,758
that will stretch the season and

164
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,519
increase the yields

165
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,280
and he pointed out they neutral

166
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,198
varieties as the most

167
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,279
obvious option in regards to the

168
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
international trends at our latitude

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
one of the advantage we have in the

170
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,519
north is that many of the commercial day

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
neutral varieties

172
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,279
actually available do not support well

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
intense heat

174
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,559
restricting continuous summer production

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,479
to areas

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,478
where the summers are not too hot

177
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,839
meaning in northern latitudes

178
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,839
or at high altitudes

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,839
now i will get into the more technical

180
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,918
part of my speech

181
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,038
and i will use quebec strawberry grower

182
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,439
system

183
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,120
as a reference so all the dates and

184
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,160
yields that i will show

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,879
are for a humid continental climate at

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,960
latitude 48 degree north

187
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,719
in quebec they neutral strawberries

188
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,839
occupy around 20

189
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
of our strawberry fields

190
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,839
more than 40 years ago california and

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
florida growers

192
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,159
adopt a new growing system on raised bed

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,038
covered with plastic mulch

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
and drip irrigation more than 30 years

195
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,680
ago

196
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
north carolina growers followed

197
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
introducing new plant types and

198
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,839
varieties

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
20 years ago the northern growers also

200
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,119
started to do the same

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,399
with they neutral varieties and they

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
adapted the system

203
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,839
to their condition

204
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,959
all day neutrals grown in the northeast

205
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
are

206
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,359
are grown on plastic culture it does not

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
seem to be profitable to grow the

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
neutrals in the traditional

209
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,038
matted rose system the plastic culture

210
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,439
system will increase

211
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,159
yield give a better fruit size increased

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,038
quality

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
a better uniformity efficiency a season

214
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,680
extension

215
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,680
and a better reliability

216
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,519
on the east coast the growers all use

217
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,400
the same suppliers for plastic culture

218
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,879
material

219
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,560
and mechanics therefore the general

220
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,360
specifications are pretty much

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,639
standard let's go rapidly to the most

222
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,759
important

223
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,478
so we use a black plastic mulch from 0.9

224
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
to 1.25 mil this depends on the duration

225
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,279
of the crop mainly the longer the

226
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,240
thicker

227
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,918
uh the bed height is from 8 to 12 inches

228
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
this will depends on the type of soil

229
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,598
and the bed shaper we

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,478
use gener generally the higher is the

231
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,478
better

232
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,560
with better drainage more heat but in

233
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,598
practice the standard is more around 10

234
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
inches the bed width is from 20 to 30

235
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,560
inches

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,759
the distance between the beds is from 48

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,439
to 60 inches

238
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
just really depends on the bedding

239
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,959
equipment you will use

240
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,198
and ultimately depends on the distance

241
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,918
between the tractor wheel

242
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,439
distance between the plants is 12 inches

243
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,878
and distance between the row

244
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,800
is from 12 to 14 inches on the bed this

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
depends on the bed size

246
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
you need to remember that plant must be

247
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
keep at least at least six

248
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
inches from the bed shoulder so fruit

249
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,200
don't lay on the ground and don't get

250
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,439
dirty

251
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,919
and finally the density is between 15

252
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,839
000 and 22 000 plants per acre

253
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,519
this will depends on all the other

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,680
distances stated above

255
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,399
but mostly the distance the distances

256
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,559
between rows

257
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
normally about half of nitrogen and

258
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,679
potash with all the phosphorus and

259
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
micronutrients

260
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,879
are applied broadcast before shaping the

261
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,879
bed

262
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,480
the other half of nitrogen and potash is

263
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,720
applied to drip irrigation

264
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,159
but i think john will probably explain

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,920
this a lot more about that later on

266
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,240
sprinklers are used for plant

267
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,319
establishment and for frost protection

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,278
row covers are also widely used for

269
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
fresh protection

270
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:21,200
and for season extension

271
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
so now i want to give you a brief

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
overview

273
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
of the different growing system that we

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
use to stretch our picking season in

275
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,000
quebec

276
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,320
those next results and slides come from

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,958
a very innovative grower in quebec

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
called david lemire from femgonio who

279
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,199
has been very kind to share this

280
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,119
information with us today

281
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
this grower is located in the middle

282
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,919
range climate of the province and

283
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,319
is often considered by his peer as our

284
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,958
our

285
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
barometer for picking season and average

286
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,399
yield potential

287
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,199
then you represent the average between

288
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,958
the coolest

289
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
and the warmest growing zone

290
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
so okay well i'm sorry here's uh the

291
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,839
slides title or in french i just

292
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,039
couldn't change them but i'm sure you

293
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,360
will understand

294
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,879
on the top graphic uh for all the

295
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
following graphic you will have the

296
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,039
trends in prices on our local market

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
which you can see is greatly linked with

298
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,240
the vibe the availability on fruit

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,839
of fruits on the market so this is on

300
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,159
the left the price for a 10 pound box

301
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
and on the bottom graph you will see how

302
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,759
we are using different systems

303
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,519
to fill the harvest season horizontally

304
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,600
you have the picking dates from june to

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
october and vertically

306
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
you have the yield that is picked per

307
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,120
week of harvests from each hectare of

308
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,759
field

309
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,039
on this first slide you can see prices

310
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,919
on the top graph

311
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,679
and yields on the bottom graph in blue

312
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,319
for the matador system

313
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,359
and in red for the day neutral system

314
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,879
that we use

315
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,879
with bare root plants and then over the

316
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,159
last few years we've added a lot

317
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:03,439
a lot many new growing system

318
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,879
so in light blue uh more recently we had

319
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
a jewel plug plants

320
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,799
that give an earlier cropping pattern

321
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
starting at least two weeks before the

322
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,278
matted row

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,079
to pick even earlier our company nova

324
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,159
fruit

325
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,958
introduced a new hurley variety called

326
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,879
clary shown here with the yellow line

327
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,239
it will start to crop three weeks before

328
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,399
jewel in matadro

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
and will be almost done picking with

330
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,278
when prices get lower

331
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
and finally and this is our subject we

332
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,919
added they neutral varieties

333
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,838
using plug plants shown by the purple

334
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,439
line instead of bare root plants shown

335
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,320
by the red line

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
plugs of seascape give a very hurly crop

337
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
followed by a continuous picking

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,039
all through october nowadays

339
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,480
there are basically two ways of growing

340
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,799
danger trawls in the northeast

341
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
depending on the plant type the most

342
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,199
popular system is to plant during

343
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,680
springtime with bare root dormant plants

344
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,240
and the alternative system is to plant

345
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,319
late summer with plug plants

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,560
today in quebec the spring planted bare

347
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
roots are used on 80 percent of the

348
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,518
acreage

349
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
while plugs are used on 20 percent of

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,278
the fields

351
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
quebec growers are nearly putting in the

352
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,799
ground eight million plants of seascape

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
and a few other day neutrals

354
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,120
bare root dormant plants have been the

355
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,440
standard plight for many years in the

356
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,278
matador and plasticulture system

357
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,480
they are grown for a full season in the

358
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,639
nursery field

359
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,959
dug in the late fall and kept in the

360
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,120
cooler during winter

361
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,799
they are very adaptable and provide many

362
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,919
opportunities to use in different

363
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,599
growing system

364
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,039
as well as being relatively cheap

365
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
compared to other plant types

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,799
plugs are runner tips that have been

367
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,799
rooted in peat based media

368
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,719
they are also called misted tips in

369
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,278
other areas

370
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,440
they are rooted in the nurseries in july

371
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,720
and planted in the field late august in

372
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,880
quebec

373
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
plug plants cut cost at least double the

374
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,480
price of bare roots so

375
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
it is a more risky business but they

376
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
also give an earlier production

377
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,479
better fruit quality and they can to

378
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
some extent be planted mechanically

379
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,399
so let's come back to the bare root and

380
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,360
let me describe the spring planting

381
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,120
system

382
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
with bare roots that we use to grow the

383
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,240
neutrals

384
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,320
these fields are are treated as a as an

385
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
annual crop

386
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
as soon as possible in april the first

387
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,679
thing that growers do is shape their bed

388
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,599
lay plastic

389
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,519
and put the bare roots in the ground as

390
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
you can see on this picture

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,679
and this is what it looked like a few

392
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
days after planting

393
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,719
the flowers are removed during four to

394
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,120
six weeks

395
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,079
to help the plant build up a good leaf

396
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
canopy that will support the summer crop

397
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,679
if the plants are too weak at the

398
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,720
beginning of the harvest in july

399
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,559
they will lag behind all summer long we

400
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
always try to keep in mind marketing

401
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,000
consideration and

402
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,920
the fruits from those first flower would

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
be harvested at the end of june when the

404
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,399
prices are at their lowest range

405
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
so the decision for us is easy to make

406
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,000
in week and we cut the flowers

407
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,040
until mid-june and this is to support a

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
stronger crop that will last until fall

409
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,838
if a good plant balance is maintained

410
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,919
and the crop is kept free of pathogen

411
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,000
fruit production can last until the end

412
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,838
of october and even a little later in

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,639
november with the use of row covers

414
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,120
the growers are picking in average 25

415
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,000
000 pounds per acre on day neutrals

416
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,919
about 1.3 pound per plant making this

417
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,278
system among the most productive in the

418
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,958
north

419
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:43,360
however however

420
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,399
a lot of cost and risk are involved into

421
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
this business

422
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
making it very challenging all the

423
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,479
profitability is based on one single

424
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,560
season

425
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,440
so it can easily become an economical

426
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,838
disaster if something goes wrong

427
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
an infestation of spider mites tarnished

428
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,040
plant bugs

429
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:05,278
or even powdery meals you can greatly

430
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,278
affect the the crop quality and yields

431
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,600
some of the bare root they some of the

432
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,320
bare root day neutral fields

433
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,879
are overwintered to give an early spring

434
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,720
crop the following spring

435
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,278
if the yields were low during the first

436
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
year it can still give a good second

437
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,399
crop

438
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,799
however in our nurtured conditions a

439
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
planting that has given 25 000 pounds

440
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,439
per acre the first year

441
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
will have very big and ramified plants

442
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
and those plants will tend to give

443
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,399
small fruit of lesser quality the second

444
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,799
year

445
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,159
this system of holding seascape plants

446
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,399
for a second year

447
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,159
is well known by the buyers here who

448
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,159
state that we should not start our

449
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,360
picking season with such a low quality

450
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,480
fruit

451
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,440
it is partly as an answer to that to

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
that demand

453
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,800
that strawberry growers have started to

454
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,039
use plug plants

455
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,240
so over the last five years an

456
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,639
increasing proportion

457
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,799
of day neutral plantings in quebec have

458
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,799
been done with plug plants

459
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,479
now more than 20 percent of the neutral

460
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,120
plantings in our province are done with

461
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,800
plugs and

462
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,799
it is still increasing every year

463
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,679
plugs are planted late august then the

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,759
plants are grown late in the fall

465
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,599
under a row cover and they are in

466
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,480
perfect conditions to build up those

467
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,399
flower buds

468
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,879
that will give a very early quality

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,879
spring crop

470
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,958
with plugs the flowers don't need to be

471
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,278
cut like with dormant plant

472
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,518
because plugs are already well

473
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,320
established since the previous fall

474
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,879
so you can get a very early june crop of

475
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,160
about

476
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,078
15 000 pounds per acre

477
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
here you can see the difference in the

478
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,559
cropping pattern between bare root

479
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
and plugs as you can see the plug

480
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,239
harvest is very hurly

481
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,120
and gives us a very good premium price

482
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,839
for the first week of picking

483
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,759
on this site for 2008 plugs have been

484
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,639
more productive than bare root by only

485
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
10

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,919
but we often reach 20 to 25 percent

487
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,078
increase in yield with plug plants

488
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,519
however we need to consider that plugs

489
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,678
are two to three times

490
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,759
more expensive than bare roots and that

491
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
there is a real risk of winter damage on

492
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,480
the plug

493
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400
that you we don't have to deal with with

494
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
the spring plantings that are treated as

495
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,079
an annual crop

496
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,120
so now that you know the general pattern

497
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,159
let me show you a few things about plugs

498
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,838
and

499
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
about plugs that we have discovered

500
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,359
recently

501
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,399
one of the advantages with late

502
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,399
plantings

503
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
is that you can manipulate those plant

504
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
in different ways depending on what you

505
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
are looking for

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,919
so here is the first scenario this is

507
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,000
what will happen

508
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
if we put the plugs in the ground in

509
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,599
september

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
so late planting and if we don't push

511
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,839
them too hard in the fall

512
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,879
the fl the following spring this is what

513
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,038
you will get

514
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,080
these late planted plug will give a very

515
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,400
hurly crop of high quality fruit

516
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,159
the spring yield however will be lower

517
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
it can be less than ten thousand pounds

518
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,200
per acre

519
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,038
but after a three four week gap the

520
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
plants will come back with a very heavy

521
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,119
production in august and september

522
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,679
which is almost as good as with bare

523
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,678
root plants

524
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,119
then the second scenario with the red

525
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,038
line

526
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
this is if we push the plant as much as

527
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,038
we can during the planting year so for

528
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,679
example we plant early in august

529
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,679
we put the row covers early we fertilize

530
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,679
and water a lot in the fall

531
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
this will tend to give a very strong

532
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
plant in the spring that will

533
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,440
crop a little later than the than the

534
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
late planting but that will give a very

535
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
heavy spring crop

536
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,678
it can range it can range from twelve

537
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
thousand pounds to sometime more than 15

538
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,440
000 pounds per acre with seascape in our

539
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,240
area

540
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,320
however it seems that we cannot cheat

541
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,798
the plant and that there is a maximum

542
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,439
yield potential for a certain variety

543
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,558
in a certain field here on this graph

544
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,679
both system

545
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,759
have given the same 24 the same total of

546
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,360
24 tons per hectare

547
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,919
in this trial what happens most of the

548
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,000
time

549
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
is that after the heavy spring crop in

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,279
early june

551
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,439
the plants are getting tired and the

552
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,279
late summer yields are always lower than

553
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,000
with the bare root plants

554
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,519
this reduction in arves gets even worse

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,759
in situation where the

556
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,759
the spring yield is higher and where the

557
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,319
climate is warmer

558
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,319
so at the end you more or less get the

559
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,759
same yield with the early planting than

560
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,759
with the late planting

561
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,279
but the picking are staggered

562
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,919
differently over the season

563
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,918
i would like to come back to the slides

564
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,400
i've shown earlier from a quebec grower

565
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,840
called

566
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,679
david lemire now that we know that we

567
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,599
can manipulate the plants

568
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,038
this very ingenious grower started

569
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,719
figuring out how

570
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,079
he could how we could fill the gap

571
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
between short days

572
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,119
and day neutrals in the middle of the

573
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
summer

574
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:03,439
so let me show you on on the screen

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,558
well this part here he has experimented

576
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,880
different techniques

577
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,399
to find out that if we leave just a few

578
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,440
flowers in the spring

579
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
for a very early crop and if we cut all

580
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
the flowers that comes out during the

581
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,599
last three weeks of may

582
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,359
we can this way bring the gap earlier in

583
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,959
june and come back

584
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,639
later on in july with a better

585
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,720
production than if we would have

586
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,679
than if we would leave all the flowers

587
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,519
on

588
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,759
so this is what it will give

589
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,319
this flower management treatment gives

590
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
this brown curve that fits right when we

591
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,439
right when we need more fruits and when

592
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,558
the prices are at their highest range

593
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,880
so as you can see we now can pick

594
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,359
strawberries on a regular base

595
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,000
all the way from june to october by

596
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,918
managing

597
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,319
the different growing systems and plant

598
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
types

599
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,200
as many of you as many of you already

600
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,679
know there are many development in

601
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,720
europe concerning substrate production

602
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,400
high tunnels and greenhouses

603
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,759
dinner trawls are grown in many

604
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,200
countries as uk

605
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,359
france belgium the netherlands and so on

606
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
the trend is to cover the crops with

607
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,279
high tunnels

608
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,120
and with greenhouses as they neutral

609
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,960
varieties benefit a lot from this

610
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,759
protection and from a longer picking

611
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,319
season

612
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,119
in some countries almost 100 of day

613
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,480
neutrals

614
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,479
are grown under protection

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,080
substrate production on hanging gutters

616
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,000
has also become very popular and most

617
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,158
european breeding program

618
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
on day neutrals are developing varieties

619
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,000
for that particular application

620
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,360
i will not get into details today

621
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
because this would make another

622
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,240
conference but i just want you to

623
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,840
realize that

624
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,919
much is to come with the neutral

625
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,000
varieties and that we are just at the

626
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,038
beginning of a major revolution

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,038
for northern growers

628
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,919
i often show this this sentence and

629
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,839
conference

630
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
this sentence i heard from peter vinson

631
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,359
in united kingdom

632
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,519
20 years ago we had 20 different

633
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,599
varieties in one growing system

634
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,798
now we have 20 ways of growing the same

635
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,359
variety

636
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,000
it really reflects well the sand or

637
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,439
grower

638
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,159
are growing or following with the

639
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,519
neutral varieties

640
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,840
so if you wish to have more details

641
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,319
i invite you to visit our website at

642
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,678
www.novafruit.com

643
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,240
well you can find all the different

644
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,798
graphs and the different growing systems

645
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,880
we are using here

646
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,119
our plug plant nursery which you can see

647
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,240
here is located southeast of montreal in

648
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,158
canada

649
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,519
our goal is to grow the best strawberry

650
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,799
plugs in the northeast

651
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,400
and supply this new emerging market

652
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,319
so i'd like to thank you very much for

653
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
your attention

654
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,158
thank you very much simone we do have a

655
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,240
couple of questions

656
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
kay would like to know when would the

657
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,798
june bearing plants be producing in your

658
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,798
climate

659
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,678
uh okay well there there is a difference

660
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,639
of about 10 days from

661
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,480
from the south of montreal to the east

662
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,520
of quebec city

663
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
but let's let's let's uh take david

664
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,440
lemire as an example

665
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
so we will normally start to pick the

666
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,759
earliest planting

667
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
by the latest days of may so for example

668
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,359
the clary used

669
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,798
as plug plants will be picked like the

670
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,000
25th of may

671
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,480
and then the jewel as plug plant will be

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,679
picked

673
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
from the 5th of may and then we get into

674
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,038
the

675
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
the bare root short day uh well i need

676
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,359
to talk about the seascape also that

677
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
would normally

678
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,558
be picked between the first and the

679
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,639
fifth of may if used

680
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:49,119
as a plug and then we get into the the

681
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
bare root plantings on plastic that will

682
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,959
start to pick around

683
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,278
the 10th of of june and then we get into

684
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,558
the matted row system between the 15th

685
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,558
and the 20th of june and then we get

686
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,240
into some of the programming crop this

687
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,599
is another system that i haven't talked

688
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,679
about but we get small

689
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,798
yields from program it crop by the first

690
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,519
days of july

691
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,400
and then from about mid july we get into

692
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,879
the day

693
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,960
the day neutrals uh both plugs that are

694
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,200
coming back for a second production

695
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,558
and bare roots that are coming up with

696
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,038
their first production

697
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,879
so well it's a bit confusing but there

698
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,879
there's a lot of system that we

699
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,960
use now to spread our growing season

700
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
thanks simone and laura mcdermott would

701
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,319
like to know

702
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,000
do the early seascape fruit compete well

703
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,480
with the traditional june bearers like

704
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
jewel

705
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,240
in terms of flavor and customer

706
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,440
acceptance

707
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,159
uh well this is a very good question

708
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,798
yes for seascape but if we are talking

709
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,520
about this the seascapes that are

710
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,759
held for a second year uh no the quality

711
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,879
is very low the fruit size is lower the

712
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,919
shelf life's lower

713
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,320
the taste is lower uh while with young

714
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,440
plantings as with plug plants

715
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,119
or also with with uh with bare roots but

716
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,679
that haven't produced a lot on the first

717
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,359
year

718
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,120
then we can get a very good quality

719
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,639
early in the spring what happens

720
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,479
normally with seascape is that

721
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,320
we get a lower quality during the

722
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
warmest period of the year

723
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,678
so in july when temperatures are very

724
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,599
warm the

725
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
the quality can decrease but early in

726
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,839
june and later on in august

727
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
uh with seascape here we can get a very

728
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,439
good quality fruit

729
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,440
that can compete with with jewel

730
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,038
mickey from poland would like to know

731
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,319
about the winter hardiness with day

732
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,000
neutrals

733
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,918
oh well this is another very good

734
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,359
question uh one of the reason

735
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,440
why we have such a bad quality and such

736
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,599
bad results with overwintered

737
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,159
seascape or albion or any other of the

738
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,798
day neutral that we grow here

739
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,480
is because of winter damage so the

740
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,879
plants normally in the spring are

741
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,798
kind of weak they push out a lot of

742
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,039
flour they do not have a lot of good

743
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,720
leaf coverage or good leaf canopy to

744
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:03,038
support those fruit

745
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,480
so this is how we get a low quality uh

746
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,400
one thing you need to remember with

747
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
winter hardiness is that the older the

748
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,278
plant

749
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,479
the weaker it will be to to go through

750
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,798
winter so

751
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,519
with old plantings we get those winter

752
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,359
damage

753
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,119
while when we work with plug plants that

754
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,719
are planted in august with very young

755
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,359
tissue and very young plants that has

756
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,278
been grown

757
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,879
in the same summer then winter

758
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,720
resistance becomes very good

759
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,559
so we almost never see winter damage

760
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,798
on seascape plugs uh while we

761
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,720
we most of the time see winter damage on

762
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,558
on the bare root plantings that that are

763
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
overwintered for a second here

764
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,839
but we you we need to use row covers on

765
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
the plugs

766
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,558
and in the areas where the the snow

767
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
coverage is not very good we also use

768
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,599
fences in the in the field so let's say

769
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
that

770
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,480
each 10 or 15 rows will put the fence

771
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,000
all across the field just to accumulate

772
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,000
more snow during the winter time

773
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,839
okay are there any other questions for

774
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,240
simone

775
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,000
and you'll have a chance to ask more at

776
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
the end

777
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,359
okay kevin comes with a nice question

778
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,240
also where is there

779
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,319
not more albion i know that in ontario

780
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,079
albion has taken a lot of place

781
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,798
uh if we talk about the bare root plants

782
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,720
we have a very good quality crop with

783
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:21,839
albion but the problem is that we pick

784
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,079
it very late

785
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,839
so we'll start to pick it let's say by

786
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,798
mid august we'll start to have good

787
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,720
yield out of it

788
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,319
and the season is so short afterward

789
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,360
that we just cannot pick the yield out

790
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,879
of it so

791
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:38,000
albion is not using our climate uh

792
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,679
with with bare root plants with plug

793
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,119
plants the scheme is a bit different

794
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,798
because then the establishment of the

795
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,119
plant is done in the fall

796
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,440
and we start to pick early in the spring

797
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,479
so the the growth that albion need to

798
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,038
start production

799
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,880
it's considered as a as a weak day

800
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,798
neutral so it needs a lot a lot more

801
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,880
time than seascape to get established

802
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,879
and to start a good production

803
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,000
in in the spring with plug plants we

804
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,519
start to pick with albion but then if

805
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
the climate stays cool

806
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,798
seascape still gives better yield and

807
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,840
albion uh

808
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:14,158
as plug plant also so well over the last

809
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,199
four years i would say that

810
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,840
in the warmest region of quebec

811
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,000
two years out of four seascape still has

812
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,918
been better than albion as plug plant

813
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,359
and in the coolest place of quebec in

814
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,960
the coolest areas

815
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,439
uh let's say that one year out of four

816
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,079
albion has been better than seascape so

817
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
it is

818
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,558
not adopted yet as a as a variety the

819
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
fruit quality is wonderful

820
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,599
but we just cannot pick the yield out of

821
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,278
it with both types of plants

822
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,879
ian mcgregor would like to know what

823
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:49,919
thickness of row cover you're using

824
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,000
uh well another good question we uh we

825
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,120
have put we have thrown away all the

826
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,960
the row covers under 30 grams so the 19

827
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,558
gram per square meter row covers are not

828
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,679
used we use row covers between 30 and 40

829
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,558
grams

830
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,960
and what growers are considering now is

831
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,519
the durability of those row covers

832
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,720
versus the price and we realize that

833
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,000
investing in

834
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,519
heavier row covers like the 42 grams or

835
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,119
even the 60 gram or

836
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:22,319
double layer of 40 grams

837
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:27,119
gives us a longer durability so

838
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:30,079
well 30 to 40 30 to 40 grams per per

839
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,079
square meter would be the average in the

840
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,720
row covers used

841
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,199
okay simone will be back with us again

842
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,519
uh

843
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,558
at the end to answer more questions

844
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:46,158
we'll take this one more from

845
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:48,158
rajmund uh oh it's a comment he has

846
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,919
he agrees with simone about albion that

847
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,960
the fruits are too late and the yield is

848
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,799
low

849
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,120
and simone thank you very much and

850
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,038
please stay with us

851
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,158
and now i want to introduce to you our

852
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,440
second speaker

853
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,720
mr john zanstra john completed his

854
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,798
bachelor of science degree in

855
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,880
agriculture and master of science at the

856
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,319
university of guelph

857
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,360
and has been with the university of

858
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,839
guelph ridgetown campus since 1994.

859
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,519
he's responsible for conducting uh

860
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,398
cropping systems research on fruit and

861
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,158
vegetable crops in southwestern ontario

862
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,839
john is presently the coordinator of the

863
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,640
agriculture and horticulture diploma

864
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,038
programs at

865
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
ridgetown campus and also teaches

866
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:27,759
courses in fruit and vegetable crop

867
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,678
management

868
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,960
he manages the cedar springs fruit

869
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
research station

870
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,440
which is located on the north shore of

871
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,720
lake erie 15 kilometers east of the town

872
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
of blenheim

873
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
the main focus in the fruit research

874
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,319
program for the past few years

875
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,159
is the development of cropping systems

876
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,639
for day neutral strawberries including

877
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,840
high tunnel production

878
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,840
john hello

879
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,359
am i here you are here i am here i'm a

880
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,479
radio celebrity this is cool

881
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,079
um just to reflect what uh what simon

882
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,640
has said it's an interesting way to

883
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,759
to bring this information across so

884
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,880
we're happy to be here

885
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,679
um maybe just update again our add to

886
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,840
what you had

887
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,600
included the the site that we're working

888
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,558
on is kind of midway between

889
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,678
um london and windsor ontario so we're

890
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,558
about an hour and a half

891
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,600
to the east of of detroit so so north

892
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,639
shore lake erie

893
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,359
a warmer production area we have a fair

894
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,799
bit of trouble with production during

895
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,240
the hotter part of the summer and i'll

896
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,158
allude to that a little bit

897
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,679
so what i want to do is just score a

898
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,919
little bit of background why we're

899
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,480
interested in fertigation especially

900
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,159
neutral system um talk a little bit

901
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,519
about your irrigation because

902
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
you have to have a good handle on your

903
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,240
irrigation system if you're going to be

904
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
adding fertilizer through it

905
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
a few comments on fertilizer selection

906
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,159
um micronutrients and then

907
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
considerations and rates and some of the

908
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,919
techniques that we use to

909
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,240
put foundation in i also want to go over

910
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,759
a little bit of our

911
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,720
a little bit of our current research

912
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
that we're doing

913
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,480
and um and then just finish off some

914
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,000
micro nutrients and i

915
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,000
see that i've got a comment about

916
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,558
speaking loud is everybody able to hear

917
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,558
me all right

918
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,558
are we good for you there kathy john no

919
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,679
you need to be

920
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,519
louder how do i okay i've got this thing

921
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,759
cranked up but anyhow

922
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,120
we will try to talk a little bit louder

923
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,599
all right so why fertigate well we've

924
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,439
got it for

925
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,079
we've got a day neutral system we've got

926
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,919
uh raised beds and plastic and a drip

927
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,199
tape so why not put fertigation in there

928
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,640
it's a logical

929
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,159
um a logical extension of a typical day

930
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,240
neutral production system and

931
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,080
relative to or compared to say putting

932
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,200
everything on as dry fertilizer in the

933
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,278
spring

934
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,880
some of the published benefits of

935
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,440
fertigation and many of these will apply

936
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,679
to a

937
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,038
strawberry system you can feed the crop

938
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,640
as it needs it

939
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,720
there's a little bit being done at this

940
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,799
point in terms of targeting

941
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,000
different race fertility based on plant

942
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,759
development but i understand there's

943
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
some work in europe where they're

944
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,879
they're actually targeting the fertility

945
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,798
based on say the flower

946
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
development of the crop but it's

947
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,240
something we can move ahead with but

948
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,759
but it gives you a lot of flexibility in

949
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,079
terms of feeding the crop

950
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,319
you're putting the nutrition right where

951
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,960
the plant needs it in the root zone it's

952
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,720
it's available it's efficient

953
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,600
we see we see information

954
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,319
um suggesting savings of upwards of uh

955
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,119
say 20 30 percent in terms of fertilizer

956
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,480
because you're

957
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,558
you're getting it to the plant when it

958
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,919
needs it and in a form that's quite

959
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,119
available so here you've got some

960
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,960
savings there

961
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,759
so you've got product savings um

962
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,720
possible labor machinery fuel savings

963
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,038
because you're not having to go through

964
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,440
the field and do it mechanically

965
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,319
and lastly um your leaching potential

966
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
isn't there

967
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,158
um you manage where it goes through

968
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,799
irrigation water

969
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,399
um it's it's not going to be put on

970
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,879
early in the season and then you're at

971
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,158
the

972
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,159
at the uh you're you're working with the

973
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
weather to try and keep it where it is

974
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
so

975
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,200
so well you're able to work with that a

976
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,798
little bit better and that's some of the

977
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,679
focus that we've been working on as well

978
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,158
looking at

979
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,919
application efficiencies so we want to

980
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,600
talk a little bit about irrigation

981
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,440
you can't talk about fertigation without

982
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,559
knowing your irrigation system well

983
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,559
and and making it as efficient as

984
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,078
possible it's important to irrigate well

985
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,119
it's important to make sure that the

986
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
irrigation

987
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,879
is put on uniformly and i'm taking a

988
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,598
quote out of one of the references that

989
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,480
i used

990
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,679
a booklet titled fertigation and the

991
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,280
comment there is distribution of

992
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,039
fertigation can't be better than

993
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,320
than the distribution of water so you're

994
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,440
carrying one with the other

995
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,119
you've got to make sure you're putting

996
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,559
it in the root zone you want to give the

997
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,838
plants adequate water but you certainly

998
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,519
want to make sure that you're getting it

999
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,039
into the zone where the strawberry is

1000
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,398
going to take it off so if you're

1001
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,239
if you're flushing it all through you're

1002
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:42,960
uh you're not doing a very good job of

1003
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,479
it so

1004
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,720
having things consistent in terms of

1005
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,079
your irrigation approach is good so

1006
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,398
things you want to consider when you're

1007
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,639
irrigating for one um

1008
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,838
weather conditions evapotranspiration

1009
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,519
how much is

1010
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,199
is being used by the plant how much is

1011
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,679
being released by the soil how much

1012
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,199
irrigation water needs to go back on you

1013
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,319
need to consider the maturity of the

1014
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,039
crop

1015
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,519
as it gets bigger as it starts to hang a

1016
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,599
crop as the plant increases in size it's

1017
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,320
going to affect the amount of

1018
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,800
water that needs to be put back um if

1019
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,280
you've

1020
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
not fertigated or irrigated strawberries

1021
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,680
extensively

1022
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,679
and you've worked with other types of

1023
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,679
crops before it's not a

1024
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,679
straight crossover so you've got to

1025
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,239
consider the plant the size of the plant

1026
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,480
again

1027
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,838
the leaf area that's involved so a lot

1028
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
of considerations

1029
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:33,119
need to be to be uh put into place when

1030
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,119
you're when you're developing uh

1031
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,039
an effective irrigation system you also

1032
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,358
need to be familiar with your soil how

1033
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,519
much water is available to the plant

1034
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,639
um you've got to know the rooting depth

1035
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,838
of your plant

1036
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:48,239
uh you you need to consider how able

1037
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,920
that plant is to extract the water

1038
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,279
and so for strawberries some suggestions

1039
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,358
in the literature uh

1040
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,119
indicate that strawberry will root up to

1041
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,719
about 60 centimeters i think that's a

1042
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,480
bit extreme especially in the

1043
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,118
sites that we're on we're not getting it

1044
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,599
that deep but anyhow get some idea of

1045
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,358
of the effective area that the plan is

1046
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,440
rooting into

1047
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,199
a shovel would would be an easy way to

1048
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
to confirm that

1049
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,118
but again just just make sure that when

1050
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,720
you're putting the water on which is

1051
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,599
carrying the fertilizer that you're not

1052
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,279
moving it

1053
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,320
past the zone or you're not putting on

1054
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,960
enough and not getting into the zone of

1055
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,880
the roots of the plant some of the

1056
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,280
parameters i talked about earlier

1057
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,960
on the evapotranspiration the rooting

1058
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,960
depth the water holding capacity of the

1059
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,280
plant you can plug these into models

1060
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,838
and and calculate how much water needs

1061
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
to be added and when it needs to be done

1062
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,799
these models are quite effective and

1063
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,560
i've used a number of them in the past

1064
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,039
and you can get quite accurate in terms

1065
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,559
of

1066
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,079
replacing the water that's being used

1067
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,078
it's kind of running a spreadsheet

1068
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,519
and topping up at the end of the day or

1069
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,160
every couple days

1070
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,920
so that's one approach you can also use

1071
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,078
monitoring equipment i've listed a few

1072
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,480
things here tensiometers tdrs things

1073
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,560
that

1074
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,320
are getting more affordable and and

1075
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,880
growers might be able to use and are

1076
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,599
somewhat

1077
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,280
uh are fairly reproducible in terms of

1078
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,800
the numbers that they give you

1079
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,200
but again um even running irrigation

1080
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,240
going out and digging and finding out

1081
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,598
where it is

1082
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,078
just to make sure that you're putting it

1083
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,359
in in the zone where it needs to be so

1084
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,200
so with these monitoring

1085
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,400
techniques or this monitoring equipment

1086
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,919
you can easily

1087
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,920
see when that band of water comes

1088
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,159
through they respond fairly quickly to

1089
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,960
to irrigation water being added and that

1090
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,000
way

1091
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,559
keep keep track of of where the water is

1092
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,880
going and

1093
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,639
effectively where your irrigation is i

1094
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,280
think people don't really realize a lot

1095
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,078
of the time

1096
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,160
how far water will move and this is a

1097
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,039
table that i've picked out of again one

1098
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,639
of the

1099
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,400
booklets that i used as a reference and

1100
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,039
what it does is relates

1101
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
soil texture and moisture content of the

1102
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,880
soil

1103
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,720
i'm to the depth that the water will go

1104
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
if you're say putting an inch of water

1105
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,000
on on a particular soil so

1106
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
i'm kind of flipping here between

1107
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,159
imperial and metric my apologies but i

1108
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,240
i um i didn't have time to convert this

1109
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,598
but for example if you've got say a

1110
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,358
sandy loam soil

1111
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,960
and it's at a 50 water holding capacity

1112
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,679
if you put an inch of water on that that

1113
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,679
that water will will soak down about 16

1114
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,358
inches into the soil so it's moving a

1115
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,719
fair distance

1116
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,719
and if you're dealing with a strawberry

1117
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,879
crop you might be moving somewhat

1118
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,838
out of where that plant is actually able

1119
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,519
to pick up that

1120
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,119
that fertility so you need to be aware

1121
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,800
of that and

1122
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,480
and again keep that in mind whenever

1123
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,680
you're you're moving and

1124
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,920
putting putting water on the plant

1125
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,519
okay fertigation or fertilizer selection

1126
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,680
there's a uh

1127
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,199
there's a wide range of products that

1128
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,118
you can use and i guess

1129
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,879
the simplest thing is just to go get

1130
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
some fertilizer that you would put on

1131
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
the field it's a little more complicated

1132
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,358
than getting a mixture but it certainly

1133
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
is is

1134
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,199
cheaper um just a few cautions

1135
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,680
there if you're if you're using say

1136
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,319
granular fertilizer you you always need

1137
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,399
to do a test you always need to do a

1138
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,640
combination of what you're putting on do

1139
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,358
a jar test use the actual irrigation

1140
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,239
water

1141
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,078
um in particular if you're using say um

1142
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,239
phosphate fertilizers and you've got

1143
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,480
other other formulations with calcium in

1144
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,919
it or if your water is extremely hard

1145
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,199
and you're putting in say phosphate or

1146
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,358
salty compounds you

1147
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,960
you can get precipitates so put it in

1148
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:20,559
the jar use the actual irrigation water

1149
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,679
mix it up let it sit there for a day and

1150
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,239
if there's any type of

1151
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,519
of precipitator gunk in the water you

1152
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,479
won't want to go over the field with

1153
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,440
that you don't want to plug up your

1154
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,358
emitters

1155
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,200
can be problematic if you're using

1156
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,358
prepared formulations intended for

1157
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,919
fertigation or liquid fertilizers you're

1158
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,480
usually

1159
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
fairly fairly safe and it's not an issue

1160
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,240
but

1161
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,599
there is always that that temptation or

1162
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,279
that opportunity to to

1163
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,119
excuse me use commercial fertilizers or

1164
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,880
granular so so that's there you also

1165
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,720
have to keep in mind the

1166
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,640
solubility of these fertilizers and

1167
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,199
they're usually quite soluble but there

1168
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,519
are

1169
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,279
there are tables and charts out there

1170
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,880
that that give you information on the

1171
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,560
relative solubilities

1172
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,559
ones again to keep in mind say if you're

1173
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,039
using ammonium nitrate type fertilizers

1174
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,639
they

1175
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,719
vary in their solubility depending on

1176
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,519
the temperatures um

1177
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,279
uh ammonium sulfate ammonium nitrate are

1178
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:11,599
a couple examples where that will change

1179
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,519
so

1180
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,200
so uh be familiar with what you're using

1181
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,119
make sure it is quite soluble it'll go

1182
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,519
into solution

1183
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,800
but the uh the other approach then is

1184
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,440
just to get um

1185
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,240
just to get regular pre-made fertilizers

1186
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,559
uh just to

1187
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,559
give a bit of information or just to uh

1188
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,480
review some of the information or some

1189
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,199
of the macronutrients and the way they

1190
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,039
move in

1191
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,519
in solution and the way they're taken up

1192
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,519
by the plant uh forms of nitrogen

1193
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,280
are um are different in terms of plant

1194
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,039
response and and um

1195
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
a little bit of information on that is

1196
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,159
helpful so plants normally take up

1197
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,159
nitrogen as nitrate small amounts are

1198
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,879
taken up as ammonium directly by the

1199
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,000
plant

1200
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,880
nitrate is is the uh the concern in

1201
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
terms of leaching out of the soil volume

1202
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,559
it uh

1203
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,358
it's a negatively char it's a negatively

1204
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,318
charged ion it's not held by the soil it

1205
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,639
moves readily

1206
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,000
in the soil solution it'll it'll leach

1207
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,838
quite easily

1208
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,318
ammonium on the other hand is positively

1209
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:10,799
charged it doesn't move very well it's

1210
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,279
um

1211
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,880
it's held quite well by the soil doesn't

1212
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,720
move far in the soil profile but it's

1213
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,800
readily converted to

1214
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,318
nitrates by soil organisms and then the

1215
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,039
plant will take it up so so if you do

1216
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:22,639
put a lot of

1217
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,159
night or ammonium on it does get

1218
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,118
converted eventually depending on the

1219
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,920
soil and

1220
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,358
soil temperatures and such but but it is

1221
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,240
giving you a bit of a

1222
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,440
a buffer there because it does it does

1223
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,279
stay

1224
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,280
in the soil doesn't move around fairly

1225
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,519
quickly now feeding with

1226
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
high levels of either form in a

1227
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,199
fertigation

1228
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,880
system can affect the the uptake of

1229
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,799
other nutrients it's generally

1230
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,519
recommended that you have a balance of

1231
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,039
the two

1232
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,800
in your fertigation program so if you're

1233
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,358
if you're leaning towards heavy levels

1234
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,839
of nitrate or heavy levels of ammonium

1235
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,119
they can

1236
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,799
upset other nutrients in terms of their

1237
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,800
uptake

1238
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,359
they can they can interfere with other

1239
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,200
metabolic processes in the plant so

1240
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,239
generally they recommend that you you

1241
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,519
you use a fairly good mixture of the two

1242
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,000
um some some factual figures that i've

1243
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,239
come

1244
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,239
across are say no more than 50 ammonium

1245
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,078
uh no more than 60 nitrate in the

1246
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,679
mixture we do find

1247
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,760
examples in the literature where they're

1248
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,440
looking specifically at strawberries and

1249
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
looking at different ratios of the two

1250
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,358
and

1251
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,960
uh there are suggestions that

1252
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,960
strawberries prefer nitrate over

1253
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,880
ammonium and i've

1254
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,880
even heard suggestions that one over the

1255
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,640
other will promote vegetative growth

1256
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,240
more than reproductive growth and you

1257
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,279
may want to use that early in the season

1258
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,159
to

1259
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,680
to enhance plant growth but but

1260
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,318
typically a mixture of the two

1261
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,919
is good not um not moving too far in one

1262
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,838
direction or the other

1263
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,280
um a few comments on phosphorus soil

1264
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,400
phosphorus as a whole

1265
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,440
is not terribly available it's slowly

1266
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,440
mineralized and

1267
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,800
released to the plant it tends to bind

1268
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,280
fairly tightly

1269
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,160
availability is best at say between six

1270
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,680
and seven

1271
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:10,480
soil ph uh generally pre-planning

1272
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,000
pre-plant incorporation is is more

1273
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,280
economical when you're dealing

1274
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,679
with a a particular strawberry crop

1275
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,119
um some of the considerations there when

1276
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,639
you're transplanting you want it to be

1277
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,280
there so unless you've got your beds

1278
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,078
down

1279
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,839
uh sorry your irrigation in place and

1280
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
you've started to put some phosphate

1281
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,559
down

1282
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,400
it's likely a good idea to have enough

1283
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,480
in the soil when the plants go in

1284
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,559
either as a plug or as a bare root plant

1285
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,079
just to stimulate root development

1286
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,159
get the roots going if you put some in

1287
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,640
as a transplant solution be a good idea

1288
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,639
but

1289
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,318
but to uh to try and rely on a

1290
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,759
fertigation system to put it all there

1291
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,559
might not be the most effective way to

1292
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
do it

1293
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,159
uh with long season crop like strawberry

1294
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,440
some suggest it might be useful to add a

1295
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,159
bit through the fertigation but in

1296
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,039
general it's

1297
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,519
it's put down all pre-plant and then

1298
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,880
it's

1299
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,239
made of it's available to the plant

1300
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,760
throughout the season plants don't

1301
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,039
really require an awful lot of it

1302
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,079
relative to

1303
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,400
to nitrogen or or pot ash so

1304
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,359
pre-planet or corporation of most of it

1305
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,318
is usually

1306
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,400
a good way to go potash as well most of

1307
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,000
our soils have adequate pot ash it's

1308
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
really only a small amount that's

1309
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,358
available to the plant

1310
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,838
and there's this equilibrium in the soil

1311
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,719
between fixed potash and available pot

1312
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,519
ash

1313
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,239
it too a fair portion of it is often

1314
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,639
pre-plant

1315
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,719
incorporated it doesn't move far in the

1316
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,400
soil it's often

1317
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,838
well available to the plant but we often

1318
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,200
like to to add a little bit through the

1319
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:33,519
fertigation there

1320
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:36,399
there's a fruit quality issues

1321
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,480
associated with with extra potash and

1322
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,760
it's again something that that we tend

1323
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,440
to put a little bit in the in the

1324
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,160
fertigation solution just to make sure

1325
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,760
that

1326
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,759
that uh enough is there enough is

1327
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,640
available to the plant and in some cases

1328
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
it's it's

1329
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,879
recognized that even though the soil has

1330
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,240
a lot there um that the amount that is

1331
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,400
available to a planet

1332
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,598
at any given time just isn't enough to

1333
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
to provide adequate

1334
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,640
growth and development so we'll add a

1335
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,759
little bit to uh

1336
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,039
to the fertigation solution as well

1337
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,160
so when you're starting to fertigate

1338
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,920
obviously the first thing you want to do

1339
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,000
is test your soil

1340
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,519
if there is adequate amounts there you

1341
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,719
may not want to add any more through the

1342
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,199
fertigation solution

1343
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,039
um you want to make sure you know what

1344
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,039
uh what is there so you're not spending

1345
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,159
extra money putting putting material on

1346
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,279
that you don't need you want to make

1347
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,159
sure your soil ph

1348
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,599
is in a range that that provides optimum

1349
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,960
uptake of the nutrients and

1350
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,280
optimum growth for the for the

1351
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
strawberry depending on where

1352
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,880
where you look and and where you're

1353
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,640
located it can vary but generally

1354
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,640
between six and a half and say seven

1355
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,759
two seven three is the ph range that we

1356
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,960
talk about

1357
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,480
don't see a lot of reference in the

1358
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,679
literature about testing irrigation

1359
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,199
water but i don't think it's a bad idea

1360
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,519
to do that either again just to make

1361
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,358
sure that that you don't have any

1362
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,599
high levels of particular nutrients in

1363
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,759
your water to make sure that you're not

1364
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,440
having to deal with really hard water or

1365
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,240
water where the ph is off and it's going

1366
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,318
to mess up your

1367
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,399
your nutrient availability so know what

1368
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,079
you're getting into and and

1369
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,480
know know what your soil is like know

1370
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,519
what your water quality is like just to

1371
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,880
to be able to uh not have to worry about

1372
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,239
those issues and

1373
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,160
make sure that you're you're in good

1374
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,358
shape there some of the things to

1375
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,838
consider when you're

1376
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,838
you're trying to determine the rates of

1377
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,039
fertigation

1378
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,920
um so i talked about how much is

1379
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,759
supplied by the soil and the water

1380
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,760
again in terms of the soil what your

1381
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,359
previous crops are in terms of nitrogen

1382
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,160
is there any residue there that's going

1383
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,159
to be

1384
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,239
providing extra nitrogen or residual

1385
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,920
nitrogen in the soil um

1386
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,439
keep in mind strawberries as well that

1387
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,119
if you're dealing with a crop that

1388
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,720
overwinters usually early spring growth

1389
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,559
in a strawberry a lot of the

1390
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,799
the nutrition a lot of the nutrition

1391
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,159
comes from the plant itself

1392
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,760
the crown of the plant at least for the

1393
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,199
first few weeks of growth so you may not

1394
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,920
have to feed it quite as heavy at that

1395
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,838
point

1396
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,119
um when the plant requires the nutrient

1397
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,119
well again that's still

1398
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,318
uh not terribly clear with strawberries

1399
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,920
we're not um

1400
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,119
we're not really advanced in that area

1401
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,159
so that's hopefully something that will

1402
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,119
come along

1403
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,318
down the line so we can more more

1404
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,240
effectively

1405
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,000
feed the plant at particular areas when

1406
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:06,078
it's looking for nutrient

1407
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,760
so what rates do i use um p and k

1408
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,000
again just general rates they don't have

1409
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,760
a real big growth response in terms of

1410
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,079
strawberry development nitrogen is one

1411
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
we concern ourselves with most

1412
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,119
depending on where you are i really

1413
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,119
can't give any specific

1414
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,318
recommendations obviously but um you

1415
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,720
need to consider

1416
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,639
again what your soil is like where where

1417
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,358
you're growing what your your

1418
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,879
seasonal length is if you survey the

1419
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,199
literature

1420
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,240
particularly in particularly in north

1421
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,919
america

1422
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:38,239
we see rates anywhere from no response

1423
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,880
to additional nitrogen upwards of

1424
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,239
three quarters of a kilo of nitrogen per

1425
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,920
hectare per day

1426
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,000
so again soil type will have a big

1427
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,920
effect on that

1428
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,519
in general it's felt that growers use

1429
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
more than they really need

1430
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,800
it might be seen as a as an insurance

1431
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,599
policy but

1432
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,720
um a lot of the time you really don't

1433
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,440
need to put on as

1434
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,439
much as you as you are um if you're

1435
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,519
getting more than you need either you

1436
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,280
you run the risk of losing it through

1437
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,920
through leaching in the soil but also

1438
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,200
a big lush plant isn't a good thing it's

1439
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,000
well documented that

1440
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:15,039
say botrytis and thoraconos incidence is

1441
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,599
higher if you've got high nitrogen rates

1442
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,558
fruit quality is poor storage is poor so

1443
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,400
there are a lot of

1444
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,000
a lot of drawbacks to having too much

1445
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,960
nitrogen in your

1446
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,679
in your in your fertigation as well i

1447
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,039
was at a

1448
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,639
talk a few days ago and this fellow was

1449
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,838
talking about grape production and his

1450
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,440
comment there was we're not

1451
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:32,719
wood growers or fruit growers and i

1452
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,559
guess you could sort of see the same

1453
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,199
with strawberries you want a certain

1454
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,640
size of plant but too much nitrogen in

1455
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,598
particular is you're growing a lot of

1456
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,598
extra leaf there

1457
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,680
and it may not be necessary it may cause

1458
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,000
you more trouble than you uh

1459
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,199
then you actually are more problems than

1460
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,838
benefits

1461
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,639
in terms of application of fertigation

1462
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,078
you want to be

1463
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,480
um below a one percent solution in your

1464
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,160
final mixture so you make up your stock

1465
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,199
solution and there's a number of ways to

1466
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:00,879
get it into the

1467
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,318
into the fertigation or into the

1468
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,400
irrigation lines

1469
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,558
some sources say upwards of five percent

1470
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000
um others are more cautious since they

1471
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
really don't want more than one percent

1472
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
but the concern is damage to the roots

1473
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,679
uh just shoving too much in there and

1474
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
causing trouble

1475
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:16,960
it varies with again with the

1476
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,039
formulation the electrical conductivity

1477
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,639
of the particular formulation and and

1478
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,719
what type of plant you're dealing with

1479
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,239
but it is a good line a good guideline

1480
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,078
to go by so

1481
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,598
our solutions never are more than one

1482
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,200
percent um

1483
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,119
depends on how quickly you put them on

1484
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,439
as well but again it's a good guideline

1485
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,440
to prevent any problems in the field

1486
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,440
we try to get our applications of

1487
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,200
fertigation on fairly quickly so what

1488
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,400
we'll do is we prime the system make

1489
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,480
sure everything's running well

1490
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,559
get water through through all the drip

1491
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,920
tape we try to get a fertigation on

1492
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,400
within a half an hour generally they

1493
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,680
suggest within a half to uh to an hour

1494
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,119
you don't want to go longer than that

1495
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,799
because you tend to dilute things and

1496
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,400
again you want to keep it in that zone

1497
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,839
of use by the plant

1498
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,519
and then when it's all done we'll flush

1499
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,039
the system again for another 10 or 15

1500
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:00,079
minutes what we're concerned with there

1501
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,759
is is

1502
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
uniformity across the field if you've

1503
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,520
got rolling topography you may get more

1504
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,519
settling in the low areas

1505
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,000
so you just want to make sure that that

1506
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,960
the uniformity of application is is

1507
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,079
maintained so

1508
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,599
little flush afterwards it um seems to

1509
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,039
work well and then you keep track of

1510
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,880
your soil moisture and add more if you

1511
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,558
need to but um the actual

1512
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,240
fertigation application tends to be

1513
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,960
fairly short

1514
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,479
now you can also base what you put on in

1515
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,639
terms of what the plant

1516
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,159
uses and i've i found a few sources um

1517
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,239
on the internet actually which which

1518
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,838
suggests where or how much the

1519
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,479
strawberry plant uses

1520
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,279
over over a cropping system one of them

1521
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,119
only

1522
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,040
only one of them i should say really

1523
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,920
indicated what the size of the crop was

1524
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,719
and and

1525
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,200
um of the three two were fairly fairly

1526
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,879
close

1527
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,118
in in terms of how much the crop

1528
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,838
actually is but say for example on

1529
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,920
nitrogen

1530
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,960
now with this 30 ton crop there was kind

1531
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,240
of a range but anywhere

1532
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,280
between say 57 and and 78

1533
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,479
kilos per hectare is taken up by the

1534
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,839
fruit and the plant

1535
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,079
to produce that 30 ton crop phosphorus

1536
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,639
is

1537
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,240
is fairly low potash is somewhere within

1538
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,558
that range

1539
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,279
the uh the sources that i found again

1540
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,160
ranged anywhere from 63 to 92

1541
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,599
magnesium 8 to 19 so so you can kind of

1542
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,598
get an idea from that

1543
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,280
what you need to be adding to your plant

1544
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,800
if you're interested in just replacing

1545
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,040
what is used by the plant you also need

1546
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,760
to

1547
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,358
again consider what is coming out of the

1548
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,319
out of the soil itself what is being

1549
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,558
mineralized and

1550
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,239
and also what is being re-mobilized in

1551
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,559
the plant but those are the sorts of

1552
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,239
numbers that are actually being used to

1553
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,480
to produce this crop and and

1554
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,039
in particular the nitrogen levels are

1555
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,639
fairly in fairly good agreement with

1556
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,400
what we're finding in uh in the

1557
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,239
fertigation work that we're doing

1558
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,160
so again just an idea of what's being

1559
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,159
taken up by the plant the last column is

1560
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,679
just a breakdown of what percentage the

1561
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,399
the fruit is using for

1562
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,480
uh compared to what percentage of that

1563
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,160
nutrient is is going into the plant and

1564
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,519
maintaining the plant

1565
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,279
so just to review some of the work that

1566
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,639
we're doing we've been looking at

1567
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,359
fertigation over a number of years in

1568
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:06,719
ontario

1569
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:08,558
simply because we don't have local

1570
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,118
recommendations or

1571
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,880
base recommendations on on other

1572
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,559
locations in north america

1573
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,079
we've got two production sites one in

1574
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,519
the in the cedar springs station where

1575
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,318
we are in one at the cinco research

1576
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,679
station our

1577
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:25,519
soil is fairly loamy um we've got a

1578
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:27,679
ph of uh where we where we want at 6.6

1579
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,519
organic matter of about three and a half

1580
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,639
or three point three percent

1581
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,920
compared to a coarse sandy soil on the

1582
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,118
simcoe site so

1583
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,680
what we did on these locations is um we

1584
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,599
both grew

1585
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,118
or we grew seascape at both sites our

1586
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,079
populations were a little bit lower at

1587
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,599
cedar springs

1588
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,680
we had a range of nitrogen rates

1589
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,800
anywhere from zero to 150 kilos per

1590
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,039
hectare

1591
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,559
over the season uh we would usually

1592
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,920
start in mid-may and run to about

1593
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,400
mid-october in

1594
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,960
in terms of fertigation our timing was

1595
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,480
or sorry

1596
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,039
another treatment was timing where we

1597
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,440
would start our fertigation program

1598
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,400
later in the season we would put on 75

1599
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,400
kilos but

1600
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,000
we would also we would start it in later

1601
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,920
july so we would load the back end of

1602
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,358
the season more with with the nitrogen

1603
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,680
and then lastly we had

1604
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,400
a 75 kilo practice treatment but we

1605
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,558
would also

1606
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,079
put extra potash with it to see if there

1607
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,240
was any effect

1608
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,920
in respect to that nutrient in simcoe it

1609
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,919
was a smaller trial because it's a ways

1610
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,400
away we only use three rates of nitrogen

1611
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,920
same variety that the seascape variety

1612
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,599
in this case a commercial grower came in

1613
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,838
and put the beds in so our our

1614
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,359
populations were a little bit higher

1615
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,440
and we also had a white plastic on that

1616
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,719
site which uh we find is a little bit

1617
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,318
better but we started with black and

1618
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,919
cedar spring so we continued on so we

1619
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,039
had three rates of nitrogen simcoe and

1620
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,159
we also

1621
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:45,119
had the the timing um

1622
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,719
the timing treatment so 75 kilos per

1623
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,599
hectare but beginning a little later in

1624
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:49,919
the season so

1625
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,000
so the applications were a little bit

1626
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,599
larger at every given time

1627
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,039
we put them on with the dosmatic which

1628
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,480
is a commercial diluter

1629
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,719
um can certainly be used in a field

1630
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,639
situation uh we determined our rates

1631
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,439
based on total land area not the area

1632
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,838
under plastic

1633
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,519
just to make the calculations easier and

1634
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,159
have it to relate to the growers better

1635
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,079
we

1636
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,239
we worked on a 17 17-week period so for

1637
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,680
example our 75 kilos per hectare is

1638
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,479
about 4.4

1639
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,879
kilos of nitrogen per week and and i

1640
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,199
think that's about 0.6 kilos

1641
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,440
per day so we started applications of

1642
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,078
mid-may finished in mid-october

1643
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,480
in um the nitrogen source that we use is

1644
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,440
is

1645
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,039
28 liquid which is a combination of urea

1646
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,599
and ammonium nitrate

1647
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,639
and in our pot ash treatments we added

1648
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,798
um

1649
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,920
a potassium nitrate and then topped it

1650
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,239
off with 28

1651
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,159
liquid just to give us our 75 kilos per

1652
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:45,279
hectare nitrogen

1653
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,519
in cedar springs um we really had

1654
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,440
no significant difference amongst

1655
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,679
treatments now what you're seeing here

1656
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,318
is

1657
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,679
is our fall crop so our planting system

1658
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,920
our production system

1659
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,039
that we follow is we plant in may we we

1660
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,240
harvest say late

1661
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,960
july early august through through the

1662
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,399
fall

1663
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,798
and then we'll keep that crop over the

1664
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,000
winter and we'll do a spring flush and

1665
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,639
so we'll start to harvest

1666
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,920
again say mid may and go to about maybe

1667
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,239
late june july

1668
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,358
and that's that's what we mean by fall

1669
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,318
and by spring so

1670
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:18,400
fall crop year of planting um and again

1671
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,838
on a per year basis no statistical

1672
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,599
difference i've put the three years

1673
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,960
together i've not done the stats on this

1674
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,880
but you can see there's not a huge

1675
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,519
response in terms of increasing nitrogen

1676
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,440
rates

1677
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,639
uh maybe a bit of a trend increase when

1678
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,240
we get up to say 25 75 kilos per hectare

1679
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:33,920
what i find interesting is we're seeing

1680
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:34,639
a bit of a boost if we're putting on

1681
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,400
that

1682
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,078
fertility late so there seems to be a

1683
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,639
bit of advantage at least in the first

1684
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,960
year

1685
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,798
uh the year of planting of of putting

1686
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
more in later in the season versus

1687
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,480
earlier in the season than the thought

1688
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,639
is

1689
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,240
just getting that crop developed and

1690
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:49,358
feeding it later in the season to get it

1691
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,318
going

1692
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:54,318
if you uh if you look at the following

1693
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,400
year the spring crop so this is the

1694
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,440
the crop the year after it was planted

1695
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,838
again

1696
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,960
no real response in terms of nitrogen

1697
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,920
rate as we go across

1698
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,838
from zero to 25 to 75 and they're even

1699
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,358
tending to decline as we get into the

1700
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,000
higher nitrogen rates

1701
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,279
uh no real benefit there of of putting a

1702
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,079
late crop in

1703
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,079
or sorry a late nitrogen application or

1704
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,720
loading it up late in the season

1705
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,280
and uh we we really don't see a huge

1706
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,358
benefit

1707
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,200
at this point either of the high potash

1708
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,119
it's fairly similar to what our

1709
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,679
our best treatment is in terms of just

1710
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:30,079
the overall nitrogen rate so

1711
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:32,798
we didn't see a huge benefit in in terms

1712
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,519
of adding that extra potash on this site

1713
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,239
now in in cedar springs we were um we've

1714
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,000
got this high

1715
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,919
organic our high organic matter three

1716
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,920
and a half percent organic matter

1717
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,358
in some of our early season soil tests

1718
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,440
we were finding that we were getting

1719
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,598
about 20 part per million

1720
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,679
of nitrate available to the plant which

1721
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,440
they tell me equates to about 70 80

1722
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,279
pounds of actual nitrogen so

1723
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,798
we had a fairly good rate of nitrogen

1724
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,319
available to those plants early on in

1725
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,400
the season which which may explain what

1726
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,318
we're not getting any response to

1727
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,599
to uh applied nitrogen in our

1728
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,599
fertigation

1729
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,599
if we look at simcoe in our fall crop

1730
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,400
it's on a coarser soil it's a sandier

1731
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,640
soil you can see on the top graph is

1732
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,400
our marketable yield in response to

1733
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,000
nitrogen and we can see there's a fairly

1734
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,920
good response to

1735
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,119
to increasing rates of nitrogen as we

1736
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,200
would expect

1737
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,200
and here again in in the fall in the

1738
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,358
year of planting in our fall crop

1739
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:24,399
we're seeing a bit of a boost by putting

1740
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:27,199
on

1741
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,440
the um the nitrogen having more put on

1742
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,239
later in the season versus evenly across

1743
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,599
the entire

1744
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:35,838
production season if we uh look at the

1745
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,838
win or the the spring crop in the same

1746
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,920
planting again we're seeing this

1747
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:41,039
rate increase as we're going from zero

1748
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,720
upwards to

1749
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,119
125 kilos per hectare the the benefit of

1750
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:47,358
the

1751
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,680
laid out applied nitrogen in terms of

1752
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:51,440
marketable yield really isn't there

1753
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,358
similar to what we saw in cedar springs

1754
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,720
so so uh

1755
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,719
seeing the same sort of trend there but

1756
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,719
but obviously on this coarse soil

1757
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,480
um we're seeing more of a response to

1758
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,118
nitrogen than we are on the

1759
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,760
on the uh the lumiere ground so so um

1760
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,599
here too

1761
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,440
we don't see a real response on the

1762
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,359
loams when we get into

1763
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,760
the sandier soils there seems to be more

1764
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,239
of a response because likely the

1765
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,880
just the lack of of or the lower organic

1766
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,239
matter the

1767
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,440
the higher rate of of um

1768
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,118
of leaching if it's there so not

1769
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,480
completely unexpected

1770
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:30,480
okay moving on to micronutrients um

1771
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,599
a lot of a lot of people try to to sell

1772
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,280
sell you micronutrients um my philosophy

1773
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,400
on that is unless you know you've got a

1774
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,240
problem

1775
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,318
if your soil is well maintained if your

1776
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,798
ph is good if you've got good

1777
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,440
good healthy production practices i

1778
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,798
don't really

1779
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,559
see a use in that um

1780
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,480
my suggestion which i've heard from

1781
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,920
others is is if you want to get a

1782
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,679
baseline

1783
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,200
of what micronutrients should be in your

1784
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,000
crop we do have recommendations in

1785
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,358
ontario

1786
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,960
of what the the level of nutri nutrients

1787
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,960
in the plant should be

1788
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,000
based on tissue samples but if you want

1789
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,720
to know what it's like on your

1790
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,920
own site um go to an area on your farm

1791
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:09,598
where you've got good production where

1792
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,920
you're happy with with how the plants

1793
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,160
performing and they look healthy

1794
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,240
take some tissue samples send them to

1795
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,078
the lab kind of get a baseline of of

1796
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,679
what is in your plants at that

1797
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,559
particular location and then if you run

1798
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,159
into trouble

1799
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,839
you can compare them to that you can see

1800
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,239
where you're you're getting

1801
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,358
getting into trouble and and may explain

1802
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:28,798
some problems that you're seeing if

1803
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,078
there are in fact micronutrient

1804
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:31,519
deficiencies

1805
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,559
there are suggestions in the literature

1806
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:37,519
of high boron requirements uh we've not

1807
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,559
seen that on our sites um we spend a lot

1808
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:40,079
of time

1809
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,839
on uh the only one that i'm really

1810
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,920
familiar with is is um

1811
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,519
is iron and becky hughes who works for

1812
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,960
the university of guelph and our in a

1813
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,559
northern location

1814
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,159
regularly um adds foliar iron to her day

1815
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,760
neutrals because of uh

1816
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,598
because of a deficiency she's got there

1817
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,880
on the clay but certainly not something

1818
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,318
that we've seen

1819
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:04,640
where we are where we are in

1820
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:07,358
in our site um this is a a series of of

1821
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,639
samples that i took um early on when we

1822
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,480
started working with day neutrals

1823
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,719
weren't really familiar with them

1824
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,240
this is the the second year crop so this

1825
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:15,279
is the year after planting this is a

1826
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,719
seascape crop

1827
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,519
at our cedar springs site we talk off

1828
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,598
about 19.5 tons per hectare on on this

1829
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,639
particular planting and we refer to

1830
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,240
fertigating with a complete blend triple

1831
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,558
20 and putting on about

1832
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,399
0.6 kilo per hectare per day and we

1833
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,559
would put them on once a week

1834
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,559
and so um we were we were seeing some

1835
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,920
symptoms under our tunnels this is the

1836
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,359
outside

1837
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,280
production where i was taking the

1838
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:42,719
samples from but we were seeing some

1839
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,119
some symptoms that we weren't really

1840
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,719
sure uh were were

1841
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,960
we weren't really sure what was going on

1842
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,759
and so the concern was micronutrients so

1843
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,199
we started

1844
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,440
sampling and we tried to get in every

1845
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,960
two weeks and and take fully expanded

1846
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,720
leaves recently expanded leaves so

1847
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,519
they're fairly young and

1848
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:01,279
analyzing the petioles of them and uh in

1849
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,199
the second column that's the recommended

1850
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,519
rates in ontario you can see the dates

1851
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,399
as we go across what our nutrient status

1852
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,440
was and

1853
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,920
the red the red numbers

1854
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,960
indicate where we were falling below the

1855
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,400
ontario

1856
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,159
recommended rates and you can see

1857
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,920
there's a few cases where

1858
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,078
nitrogen was dipping a little bit but

1859
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,079
certainly we weren't wildly low

1860
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,880
in our rates um potash again a little a

1861
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,039
few times

1862
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,720
mid-season where we were getting below

1863
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,519
the recommended rates but but

1864
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,879
uh not moving out in any any great

1865
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,280
degree so

1866
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,358
so um it really wasn't anything to do

1867
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,119
with nutrition and then we realized now

1868
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,078
that was more heat stress on the plants

1869
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,798
than anything but

1870
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,119
um it was just a nice way to to kind of

1871
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:44,639
see

1872
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,200
where we're going what our nutrient

1873
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,358
status was in particular the micros and

1874
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:51,118
and uh just managing them without

1875
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,679
putting any great effort on micro

1876
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,358
we're seeing any big problems there and

1877
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:56,639
no big differences

1878
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,119
so just some general comments to

1879
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,279
summarize the fertigation topic

1880
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,358
if you're new to it uh start simple

1881
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,400
become comfortable with your irrigation

1882
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:06,480
system and your

1883
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,639
your fertigation systems again

1884
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,480
uniformity is is important in putting

1885
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,078
the water down and then when the

1886
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,240
fertility is carried along with it

1887
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,039
hopefully that will will follow the same

1888
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,279
trend

1889
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,599
um soil testing and tissue testing are

1890
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,160
good indications of what's available in

1891
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,680
the soil

1892
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,679
and what's getting into the plant and

1893
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,318
it'll it'll set up some guidelines for

1894
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:25,919
you and

1895
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,920
in all cases make sure your record

1896
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,519
keeping is good what products you were

1897
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,798
using what rates you were putting on

1898
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,079
if you were happy with the condition of

1899
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,280
your plants if you think your yield

1900
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,640
potential was there

1901
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,160
you can always go back and look at those

1902
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,598
and they give you a good indication of

1903
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,798
what was going on

1904
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,119
as you move on you can refine them um

1905
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,119
one of the questions i've got is whether

1906
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,640
or not

1907
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,760
more frequent smaller doses of fertility

1908
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,239
are applicable

1909
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,400
um kind of thinking in terms of

1910
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,479
vegetable transplant production where

1911
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,200
where daily applications we find are

1912
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,639
more efficient and easier to do than say

1913
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,199
weekly applications

1914
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,400
um applications based on on plant growth

1915
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,159
is something i think that is up and

1916
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,720
coming and and might be interesting but

1917
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:07,519
we

1918
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:09,759
don't think we really have the

1919
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,119
information on that yet uh differences

1920
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,960
in variety um

1921
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,640
we wonder if albion just needs a little

1922
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,240
bit more to push it along because it

1923
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:17,358
tends to be a little slower maturing as

1924
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,838
simon mentioned but

1925
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,558
but also it tends to we think need a

1926
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,679
little bit more

1927
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:25,599
in terms of uh of growing the plant

1928
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,598
and then just sap testing on the farm

1929
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,039
there are a number of um

1930
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,400
instruments where you can go into the

1931
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,680
field yourself and then test for

1932
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,358
different nutrients and

1933
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,118
and whether that could be part of a

1934
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,279
fertigation program just to

1935
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,280
try and maintain the quality and the

1936
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,798
nutrient status of the plant as you go

1937
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,400
through the season

1938
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,000
okay that kind of concludes what uh what

1939
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,119
i wanted to talk about i just got a list

1940
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,440
of some of the

1941
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,798
books and uh yeah the books that i used

1942
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,838
to put this together and

1943
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:51,759
and there were a number of research

1944
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:52,159
articles as well that that we looked at

1945
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,920
so

1946
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:56,838
so if you want to look at them further

1947
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,318
so thank you for your time and uh

1948
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:02,639
yeah okay

1949
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,558
okay john thank you very much there are

1950
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:08,318
some questions in the chat box

1951
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,319
uh the first one is from rajmiki again

1952
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,480
he's wondering if the application of

1953
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,759
multi-microbial inocula as a bio

1954
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,838
fertilizer

1955
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,280
could be more effective in plants growth

1956
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:23,599
promotion than humic acid application

1957
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:26,640
oh i really have no experience with

1958
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:29,680
any of that um

1959
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,960
um yeah i've not at all worked in that

1960
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,239
and i really didn't focus on that when i

1961
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,039
was reviewing the literature so

1962
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:36,078
sorry i i really don't know what to say

1963
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,960
in that respect it's certainly an

1964
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,880
interesting area looking at

1965
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,119
biofertilizers but

1966
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,400
it isn't something that i focused on in

1967
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:47,440
in terms of this presentation

1968
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,639
okay rod elmstrand would like to know uh

1969
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,960
why white plastic or black we're in a

1970
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,679
fairly warm production area so we prefer

1971
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,280
white it um it doesn't give us a good

1972
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,038
head start in the season but when we get

1973
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,599
into the warmer part of the summers

1974
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,039
we notice a difference on on in terms of

1975
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,519
production and quality so white is

1976
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,160
better black just gets too warm

1977
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,679
it just isn't a good situation for us we

1978
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,038
want to we want to be able to cool the

1979
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:11,838
plants or grow them in a cooler

1980
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,280
environment

1981
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,798
i was just joking with a plastic

1982
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,200
supplier a few days ago ideally it would

1983
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:16,318
be nice

1984
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:17,679
we would have something that was black

1985
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,920
in the summer and then started to fade

1986
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:23,038
and and turn white later in the year but

1987
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,798
um the thought has been about uh

1988
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,640
white washing and we've looked at these

1989
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,519
skunk-type plastics as well

1990
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,038
but the basic reason is is we're warm we

1991
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,079
want a cooler environment for our plants

1992
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,920
so so we use a white plastic

1993
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,599
kay is wondering if there's any other

1994
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,280
research with white plastic around the

1995
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,559
country or the world so if any of our

1996
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,240
other participants

1997
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,720
have some comments on that please feel

1998
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:48,239
free to weigh in

1999
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:51,358
rajman has one more question about uh

2000
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,279
once again if the phy or the phosphate

2001
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:56,000
form of phosphorus can be considered as

2002
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,000
a fertilizer

2003
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:02,880
um again not

2004
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,079
not familiar with that form of

2005
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,640
fertilizer

2006
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,680
not uh i assume again this is in the in

2007
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:12,639
more of the biofertilizer

2008
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:15,519
approach but sorry not not uh not

2009
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:18,558
familiar with that

2010
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,318
okay kay is wondering how your spring

2011
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,599
yield results compare to simon's

2012
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:23,920
comments about

2013
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,200
the spring crop being poor simon are you

2014
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,119
with us

2015
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,960
and does the second year spring harvest

2016
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:33,039
happen in may

2017
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:35,920
when june bearing begins in mid-june

2018
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,280
um maybe if i could start our in our

2019
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,760
area our

2020
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,400
day neutrals uh usually have a week or

2021
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,960
two

2022
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,760
uh benefit or earlier production than

2023
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,480
our our day

2024
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,640
or than our june bears they just seemed

2025
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,838
to start off earlier

2026
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,679
so for comparing side by side

2027
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,440
day neutrals that were planted the

2028
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,279
previous year their spring crop

2029
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,240
the following year tends to be earlier

2030
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:03,839
than a an established june bearing crop

2031
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:06,879
just just the nature of the plant um

2032
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:10,000
our spring crop the year after planting

2033
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,160
also tends to be um

2034
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
smaller the fruit size isn't quite as

2035
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:17,199
big but we we do get a fair

2036
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,599
bit of crop in that second year so we're

2037
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,838
going with a spring planted bare root

2038
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,160
plant that we would put in in may

2039
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,960
uh we'll start to crop it again in july

2040
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,879
late july

2041
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,000
august september and as long as we can

2042
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,920
go the second

2043
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,920
year you tend to lose a bit on fruit

2044
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,039
size but we do get a fairly decent crop

2045
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,280
in that second year

2046
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,039
once we get into the heat of the summer

2047
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,160
at this point we usually abandon it

2048
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,599
because it's

2049
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,598
the crowns are getting big the plants

2050
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,119
are starting to get tired

2051
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,880
we've tried different things to carry

2052
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,720
that crop further in that second year we

2053
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,318
do have some growers in ontario that

2054
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,480
that are able to do it successfully but

2055
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,159
i'm not really sure what they're doing

2056
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,599
but we're not able to win the location

2057
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:57,118
that

2058
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,798
we're at another question

2059
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,960
is if it's better to apply

2060
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:04,400
micronutrients especially boron as a

2061
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,679
foliar spray or soil application

2062
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:11,200
uh boron is easily applied as a foliar

2063
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:13,519
um i think it's uh a little less

2064
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:17,759
expensive putting it in the soil

2065
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:21,198
um boron is is tricky because

2066
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:24,238
you don't need an awful lot of it um and

2067
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:26,960
and often toxic

2068
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,919
toxicity symptoms may be somewhat

2069
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,600
similar to

2070
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:34,719
to deficiency symptoms um

2071
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,679
i've not seen deficiency symptoms in our

2072
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:38,960
plots

2073
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,480
i've heard a lot of trouble with with

2074
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,319
people getting a little carried away

2075
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,879
with it but

2076
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,679
either way it can be done but again i

2077
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,520
think the

2078
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,039
the more effective way is is to put it

2079
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,920
on or sorry the more economical ways to

2080
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:51,198
put it on

2081
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,719
as a soil application if you know

2082
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,838
there's a problem but but certainly it's

2083
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,319
it's able to be put on

2084
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:59,439
um through foliar sprays and it is

2085
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,440
effective to do it that way

2086
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:07,439
okay and then i believe

2087
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:10,000
the last question was from

2088
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,439
john branstrader he's wondering if

2089
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,759
you've worked with calcium nitrate and

2090
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,519
if you could give us some input on that

2091
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,600
i've not worked with calcium nitrate it

2092
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,880
is um one that that you hear people

2093
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,560
using especially if they're

2094
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,920
if they're interested in getting more

2095
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,600
calcium to the plant

2096
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,119
our soils are naturally very high in

2097
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,199
calcium so i'm not at all concerned

2098
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,000
about about calcium in the plant if you

2099
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,439
uh

2100
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,119
if your your irrigation is timely

2101
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:38,399
and and consistent calcium uptake um

2102
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,559
isn't usually an issue for us so um no i

2103
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,759
have not worked with it in particular

2104
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:47,039
uh we we've stuck with just the

2105
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:49,838
the liquid 28 as ours our major nitrate

2106
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:49,838
or nitrogen source

2107
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,439
okay then does anyone have questions for

2108
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,600
either

2109
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,960
simone or john

2110
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,679
while we're waiting i just want to

2111
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,600
remind you that

2112
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,359
the last in the mini series on day

2113
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
neutral strawberries the last webinar

2114
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,839
will be next friday march 4th

2115
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,760
we'll have dr frank lowes from north

2116
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,319
carolina state university talking about

2117
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,800
diseases and their management and dr

2118
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,559
david handley from university of maine

2119
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,400
talking about insect and mite management

2120
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,480
for day neutral strawberries

2121
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:26,559
i want to thank simone and john for

2122
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,319
their excellent presentations

2123
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,840
and we'll take any questions that you

2124
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,840
may have in the meantime

2125
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,639
okay michael collins is wondering if

2126
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:40,319
there you have any ideas for soluble

2127
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:43,440
organic fertilizers to use in drip

2128
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:46,158
uh again no you're you're uh

2129
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,559
you're asking the wrong person i really

2130
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:51,119
i really don't i'm not aware

2131
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,600
of what's available in terms of organic

2132
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:55,119
fertilizers um

2133
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,880
yeah certainly an interesting market but

2134
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,840
i just don't have any experience in that

2135
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,840
in that area

2136
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,920
any other questions

2137
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,880
thank you very much thank you all for

2138
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,080
