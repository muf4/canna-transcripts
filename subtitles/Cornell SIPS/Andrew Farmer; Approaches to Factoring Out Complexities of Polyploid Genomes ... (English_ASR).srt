00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:13,150
all right thank you is apparently have a

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,849
lot of slides so I'm gonna try to go

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,690
quickly through them and I might gloss

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,189
over a few things but these are the

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,970
objectives for the talk I just want to

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:27,970
look at some basically examples that I

9
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,768
think illustrate why polyploids are

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,439
challenging to work with from an

11
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:35,189
informatics perspective and a biological

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,960
perspective I want to take the time to

13
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,378
use those examples to just look at some

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,079
of the tools and resources that we've

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:46,960
developed were adopted from other groups

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,549
and adapted to our needs you know using

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,620
them for our particular research

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:54,549
community but hoping that they'll find

19
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:57,009
more broad adoption and the last is

20
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:59,439
probably the most audacious of the three

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:02,649
bullet points but I I've been working on

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,750
abstract algebra as kind of a side hobby

23
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,340
and I want to try to make a case that

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,409
it's actually of relevance to

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,420
understanding how complexity develops of

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,640
sort of nonlinear multiplicative

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,368
relationships like those that come out

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,739
of putting two genomes together so we'll

29
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:24,129
see how that goes all right so just a

30
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:28,560
quick kind of overview of polyploidy in

31
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:32,679
general you know it happens all the time

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,228
seemingly in plants it's known to happen

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,960
in some other systems but waitwe in the

34
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,578
evolutionary past so if you work in

35
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,929
plants you know all about it if you

36
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:44,559
don't work in plants it's kind of a

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,030
weird little niche but you know there

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,629
are a lot of distinctions to be made

39
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,250
about types of polyploidy and how many

40
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:54,789
genomes have come together at once how

41
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,700
how recently it was and those are all

42
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,049
important for thinking about the actual

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,180
approach you're going to take with a

44
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:06,149
particular analytic solution to a

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:09,069
problem but you know and I've heard that

46
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,979
the thinking is that one of the reasons

47
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,629
why plants are so tolerant of polyploidy

48
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:16,139
is that most of them don't actually have

49
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:20,379
sex chromosomes and that facilitates the

50
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:24,039
combination of genomes they

51
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:26,620
but you know there are challenges at the

52
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,150
plant associated with actually working

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,210
out what to do with having multiple

54
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,560
genomes but after they've done that they

55
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,170
tend to be a little bit more resilient

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,080
and so a lot of a lot of crops that we

57
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:42,939
work with certainly have have come from

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,680
polyploid events possibly because the

59
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,840
gene redundancy kind of gives you new

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,939
opportunities we'll look at some of

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,450
those questions a little bit further on

62
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,829
I mean they they tend to occur in

63
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,859
extreme environments partially because

64
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,120
those environments tend to induce

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,760
polyploid formation but also the

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,140
thinking is that they are because of the

67
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,280
built-in redundancy they're better able

68
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:07,779
to adapt to such conditions so you know

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,840
as I said there are a lot of different

70
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,849
types of polyploidy so what one

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,800
distinguishes between a low and Auto

72
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,199
depending on whether or not the two

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,520
genomes that are being duplicated are

74
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,659
the same or different there's a type of

75
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,330
polyploidy that has to do with somatic

76
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:29,949
cells doesn't actually lead to new

77
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:33,720
species but you know basically mitotic

78
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:36,159
events not not actually separating the

79
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,580
results of genome doubling into separate

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,419
cells

81
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,469
that's endo polyploidy and then

82
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,469
distinctions are made you know in terms

83
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:46,810
of how how recent the polyploidy event

84
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,759
is and how far along the evolutionary

85
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,580
trajectory it's gotten so that it's

86
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,579
effectively become a diploid genetically

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,800
again and depending on whether you're an

88
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,590
auto polyploid or an a local at

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,719
polyploid that introduces Auto

90
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,390
polyploids basically all of their

91
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,759
chromosomes well the the homologous

92
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,769
chromosomes as we call them can

93
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,289
potentially recombine with one another

94
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,590
and so that introduces new possibilities

95
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:18,099
in terms of the genetics that need to be

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,870
thought about carefully so as Liz

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,090
mentioned that we're interested in

98
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,639
comparative genomics we've developed a

99
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,579
tool for basically looking at gene

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,009
content across species each of these

101
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,478
glyphs represents a gene it's colored in

102
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,789
terms of gene families they've been

103
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:36,120
associated with

104
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,110
and when you're dealing with say simple

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,829
species like primates and mice you have

106
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,509
nice fairly simple relationships between

107
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:47,789
the gene content in the various genomes

108
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,069
one-to-one relationships in general with

109
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,260
occasional presence/absence or copy

110
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,680
number variation it's it's pretty easy

111
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,159
to just pick out but when you're

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,019
thinking about comparisons between

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,830
genomes each of which has a kind of

114
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,769
separate

115
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,439
duplication history things become a lot

116
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,719
more complicated and so here we have a

117
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,699
few different species that have

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:18,060
different polyploidy histories some

119
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,370
ancient duplications that they share and

120
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,199
then more recent duplications that have

121
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,959
been separate in the different species

122
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,539
and so we've got a little track of a

123
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,269
soybean chromosome at the top we can see

124
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,700
that it's been through to whole genome

125
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,250
doublings one of the tracks is much more

126
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,269
similar that's the more recent

127
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,319
duplication event and then you've got

128
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:42,449
some more ancient events that are closer

129
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,219
to one another because they they're

130
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,349
doubling resulted from that more recent

131
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,270
event but further away from them even

132
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,160
even something that you tend to think of

133
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:54,209
as a small genome like a rabid abscess

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,090
has again chromosome doubling or whole

135
00:05:54,209 --> 00:06:00,029
genome doublings involved with a lot of

136
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:02,089
gene loss afterwards so you can you can

137
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,319
easily see here patterns of

138
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,179
fractionation of the sub genomes that

139
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,240
resulted from these whole genome

140
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:14,670
duplication events tomato actually went

141
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,560
through a hex ploidy event and this this

142
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,430
tool you know basically allows you to

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,899
dynamically query databases for tracks

144
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,509
that have a certain gene content

145
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,329
associated with them and then pull in

146
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,099
from disparate databases tracks that

147
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,990
seem to have similar gene content in

148
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,050
terms of the gene family assignments and

149
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,480
then ultimately ask questions about the

150
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,829
evolutionary history behind genes that

151
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,770
have been aligned through synteny

152
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:43,469
together and they're their phylogenetic

153
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,589
relationships and so you can see that

154
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,300
out of those four for that particular

155
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:52,849
which was from a abscisic acid

156
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:56,100
responsive conscription factor family in

157
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,900
out of the soybean homeo logs three of

158
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,010
them retained that gene and it was lost

159
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,799
in one

160
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,230
similarly with tomato two were retained

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,740
one was lost and Arabidopsis also

162
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,980
retained two so this gives us a nice way

163
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,379
of exploring relationships among the

164
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,980
genes but the question you know that

165
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,529
still is difficult is well you know what

166
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,960
what happens to function as these things

167
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,388
have duplicated and went on their

168
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,359
separate ways and that's that's not so

169
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:31,439
easy to resolve so you know we're also

170
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,120
interested in well you know some some

171
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,250
polyploid species like soybean or

172
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,319
economically valuable and have a lot of

173
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,220
research that goes into them have their

174
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,180
own database resources with curators

175
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,180
pulling in information for the

176
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,650
literature can we make use of

177
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,199
comparative genomic techniques to

178
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,779
essentially take something like cow pee

179
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,370
which does not have that more recent

180
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,329
whole genome duplication event and

181
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,819
figure out you know okay do I have any

182
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:02,490
say snips associated with seed weight in

183
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,728
regions in this genome which I know has

184
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,370
sort of more or less two copies of genes

185
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:12,300
for every copy of a gene here and find

186
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:15,750
out well yes there there is a region

187
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,478
where I found an association between the

188
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,788
trait of interest that is similar to in

189
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,740
one of the homie August regions in

190
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:25,199
soybean where they also observed similar

191
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,530
variation so that's obviously a nice way

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,538
of taking candidate genes and figuring

193
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,129
out well you know have have I seen

194
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,458
evidence in some other species that

195
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:38,759
changes to this gene actually affect

196
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:41,399
rate of interest all right so here comes

197
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,819
the tough part making the case for

198
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,850
polynomials so just as polyploids

199
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,760
involve multiplication of kind of

200
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:55,200
independently behaving linear genomes

201
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,389
polynomials are kind of like that in

202
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,550
that you're taking together linear

203
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,289
factors

204
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,750
and if you think about it in this

205
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,029
direction it's pretty easy to go through

206
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,070
and use the distributive property or

207
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,689
things that you learned I was in Lansing

208
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,910
high school so I learned this for mr.

209
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,820
cotton mill you know you do the first

210
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:15,829
outside inside last trick and figure out

211
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,870
exactly how to do your factorization and

212
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,850
it's essentially no different no matter

213
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,149
how many factors you have you're doing a

214
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,170
combinatorial distributive

215
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:26,029
multiplication and you're you know

216
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:29,839
essentially taking the roots of the

217
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:33,199
equation and seeing them come out in the

218
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,080
coefficients in kind of interesting ways

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,330
that these are what's referred to as the

220
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,490
elementary symmetric polynomials which

221
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,970
means that it doesn't really matter how

222
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,669
you permute them you get the same result

223
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:50,210
and this ends up being very important in

224
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:52,189
terms of the theory involved in what it

225
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,500
actually means to solve a polynomial

226
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,240
equation so you know there are numerical

227
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,450
techniques that allow you to approximate

228
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,940
solutions but what algebraic people want

229
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,240
to do is to say what what is the actual

230
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,600
algorithm it can I find a formula like

231
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,320
this which I you probably remember the

232
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,840
quadratic equation you know it's it's

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,670
not exactly simple but it's it's fairly

234
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,190
straightforward you probably remember

235
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:20,629
how to get there you either memorized it

236
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,760
or you learned completing the square and

237
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:27,139
can read arrive it I mean it's it's not

238
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:29,450
too bad but once you go even to a cubic

239
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,169
equation things get really a lot harder

240
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,950
and this is a Renaissance mathematician

241
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:37,159
Tartaglia

242
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,170
who figured out how to deal with these

243
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,389
things by first performing a little

244
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:44,659
trick making and depressed cubic and

245
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:47,330
then eventually getting to a formula

246
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:49,039
that in some sense is analogous to the

247
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,100
quadratic equation but it's a lot more

248
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,959
complicated and you get you get also

249
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,080
interesting things with higher degree

250
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,139
equations like what they call cases

251
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,290
reductive lists which basically means

252
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:07,309
that you can have three real valued

253
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:10,459
roots but if they're not rational you

254
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:13,219
can't actually represent them

255
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,070
with this kind of representation without

256
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,899
involving imaginary numbers even though

257
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,350
the results that you get are not

258
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,829
themselves imaginary so as you start to

259
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,710
increase the number of factors of things

260
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:30,590
life gets interesting and going even

261
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:32,480
further it was it was eventually

262
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,310
demonstrated after you know people had

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,720
solved the cubic in the quartic it were

264
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:38,539
working real hard to try to solve the

265
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,000
quintic and eventually through the work

266
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:43,759
of a ball and yell wah they discovered

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,980
that in fact you can have fifth degree

268
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,289
equations and higher where you simply

269
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,019
can't represent the roots in any way

270
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:54,349
using that sort of representation and

271
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,569
whether or not you can get to some sort

272
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,759
of representation like that is basically

273
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,370
dependent on this notion of symmetry

274
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:06,110
among the roots and how how the

275
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,759
coefficients impose constraints upon the

276
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,310
roots whether you can represent

277
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,809
relationships among the roots starting

278
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:14,359
from what they call the field of the

279
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:17,000
coefficients so an example of that would

280
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,039
be cyclotomic polynomials which sort of

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,230
distribute themselves in the complex

282
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,899
plane around circle they have a kind of

283
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,710
a very restricted form and it can be

284
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,389
shown that any any cyclotomic you can

285
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,240
represent the roots in terms of these

286
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:35,240
I've specialized quadratic or not

287
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,870
quadratic but radical towers from the

288
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,909
field coefficients okay well there are

289
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,620
there are other times when taking

290
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:44,509
together a bunch of disparate things

291
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,419
that are simple to deal with relatively

292
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:49,309
simple individually and you try to put

293
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:52,129
them together and things get complicated

294
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:53,929
quickly even when you're doing kind of

295
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,299
the multiplication aspect of things so

296
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:59,109
this is a this is a project from which

297
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:02,059
many of the following examples are taken

298
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,860
an NSF funded project that we've been

299
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,809
working on to try to take a lot of

300
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,600
disparate information resources and

301
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:10,819
unify them in some way you know the

302
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,210
there are some technical challenge than

303
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,490
this

304
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,900
there are many sociological challenges

305
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,419
to actually getting something like this

306
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,549
to work but I won't I won't go into that

307
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,899
too much other than to say that meant

308
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,719
many of what I show would not be

309
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,240
possible without our collaboration with

310
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,339
many of these

311
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,620
groups so here's my first example

312
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,839
cultivated peanut its a recently formed

313
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:38,490
aloe tetraploid that was formed from a

314
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,740
few diploid wild species so the original

315
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,080
genome sequencing was done on the

316
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,419
diploid they kind of recognized early on

317
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,220
that the diploid were close enough

318
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,319
together that it would be challenging

319
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,720
using you know the tech sequencing

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,028
technologies available at the time if

321
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,750
you were to just sequence the tetraploid

322
00:13:54,028 --> 00:14:00,120
directly to figure out which parts went

323
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:04,080
with with which sub genomes so they they

324
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,139
approached it by figuring out which of

325
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,020
which were the actual progenitor species

326
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,549
and actually one of them is for if

327
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,889
there's only one accession of this

328
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:15,629
species out there and they believe that

329
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,659
it was transported down into the range

330
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,389
of the other species by prehistoric

331
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,309
humans allowing allowing this

332
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:26,250
hybridization event that eventually led

333
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:28,769
to the cultivated polyploid so you can

334
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:33,120
see it sort of there amidst the range of

335
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:35,338
the other species so you get you can

336
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,370
kind of synthetically create what the

337
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:41,040
amphi diploid which are I think I think

338
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,649
it's just a fancy way of saying an aloe

339
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,980
tetraploid from these things that were

340
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:50,250
created synthetically and so that that's

341
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,990
the strategic approach and you can see

342
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,409
that there are some you know if you're

343
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,889
comparing chromosomes corresponding

344
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:01,828
chromosomes from the two they are

345
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,419
different structurally in some ways but

346
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:05,729
there's kind of a clear one-to-one

347
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:09,328
correspondence between the two

348
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,789
chromosomes so one one of the

349
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:15,870
interesting things about peanut is that

350
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:17,219
you know because of this extreme genetic

351
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,990
bottleneck that it went through they

352
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,278
think that there was essentially a

353
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:26,820
single hybridization event but ended up

354
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,970
propagating into all of the cultivars

355
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,570
that we have today

356
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,570
so it it's it's very non diverse from a

357
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,230
traditional allelic sense but

358
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,960
phenotypically there's quite a

359
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,450
University associated with things and so

360
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,700
this was kind of a question for people

361
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,460
as to how is it possible for such a

362
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:54,960
limited genetic base to generate all of

363
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,100
this phenotypic diversity so when they

364
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,920
this was actually something that they

365
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,019
they began to see when the diploid were

366
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,389
sequenced and compared to data that was

367
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:08,169
available for the tetraploid but

368
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:12,669
essentially what's happening is that the

369
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:15,219
two sub genomes within the cultivated

370
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:19,809
tetraploid are interacting in different

371
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:23,680
ways such that in some cases you have a

372
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:25,750
segment of one sub genome that's

373
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,489
replacing the other ones this is just a

374
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,889
representation kind of showing copy

375
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,710
number of the two different homologous

376
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:37,330
genomes so here here we have at the end

377
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:39,879
of chromosome 14 I think it is from from

378
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,490
a particular variety of peanut a place

379
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,409
where the B ancestral genome exists in

380
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,680
two copies and the a has been replaced

381
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,399
with it in other regions where a has

382
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,229
been lost

383
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,929
he has been retained or the other way

384
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,700
around so so essentially what's going

385
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:57,399
what seems to be going on to a large

386
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,310
extent with peanut is that different

387
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,029
patterns of this interactivity between

388
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:06,039
the sub genomes are generating this type

389
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:09,009
of phenotypic diversity and they were

390
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:12,250
actually able to show that they made one

391
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:14,410
of these synthetic crosses and kept it

392
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,259
going for a few generations and we're

393
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,830
actually able to reproduce some of this

394
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:25,480
phenotypic diversity with him that

395
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:27,429
pedigree so I thought well okay if that

396
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,950
if that's the case we've got the tif

397
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,490
Runner genome sequenced could we

398
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,470
actually see what they were showing in

399
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,930
that diagram using some of tools that

400
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,029
we've produced so here's that so called

401
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,440
genome context viewer again showing us

402
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:45,730
the two homologous segments of

403
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,820
cultivated peanut and then the

404
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,500
progenitor genomes and at this level you

405
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:54,470
could you can see some cases in which if

406
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,170
seems as though the gene content of the

407
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,230
two homologous segments is reflecting

408
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,330
the bee genome rather than the a genome

409
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,829
but you know it might it might be a

410
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:06,490
little difficult to argue that that

411
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:10,129
couldn't also just be vagaries of

412
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,920
annotation effects or miss miss

413
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:17,000
assemblies and things like that but if

414
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,920
you go ahead and select say if the gene

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,859
right at the end of the chromosomes and

416
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,680
then look at it within the context of

417
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:27,019
the tree you can actually see the

418
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,950
pattern fairly clearly in terms of the

419
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:33,799
sequence level relationships that indeed

420
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,400
in this case the bee genome genic

421
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:40,309
sequence is much closer to the two

422
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,519
copies from the tetraploid than the

423
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:46,339
other genome sequences and you can

424
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,230
interact with this tool in ways that

425
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:50,629
cluck claps down the tree of just those

426
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,579
genes of interest and then see that

427
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,970
reflected in the multiple sequence

428
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:59,149
alignment you can see various places at

429
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,279
which the a genome representative is

430
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:08,240
indeed different from the others at a

431
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:10,490
number of positions but of course if we

432
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,099
take another another gene from that same

433
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,470
region of the genome it might reside in

434
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:18,740
a gene family that's a little bit more

435
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,460
complicated so here again we've got the

436
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,990
B genome with the two tetraploid x'

437
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,840
taken from the same region and behaving

438
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,440
similarly in terms of tree topology but

439
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:32,889
there are other subclades of this tree

440
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,590
with different sorts of patterns

441
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:39,440
associated with them so you can you can

442
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:41,509
pretty easily using this tool again

443
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,890
collapse down to the set of genes that

444
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:45,140
may be of interest in your particular

445
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,900
context and then go in the reverse

446
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,980
direction say well let's look at their

447
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:54,680
genomic contexts and figure out not not

448
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,299
starting with the premise that you're

449
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,000
looking at things that are all synthetic

450
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:02,509
but asking the question how would I

451
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,400
group these things given their kind of

452
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,829
gene family neighborhoods inside

453
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,840
a way that I see the synthetic

454
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:11,689
relationships that exist among members

455
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,459
of this gene family so this I guess this

456
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,960
is the next gene down from the end of

457
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,750
the chromosome that I chose so this

458
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,620
would be our chromosome 14 genes and

459
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:24,410
then this is the other gene family or

460
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,239
other clades that you can see has kind

461
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,490
of a more complicated picture in terms

462
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,460
of the gene duplications within that

463
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,690
region and again you know some some of

464
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,279
the aspects of the way that those

465
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,890
sequences appear in the tree may be

466
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,710
driven by annotation sorts very facts

467
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,770
but we we believe that these sorts of

468
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,059
tools are valuable for people you know

469
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:48,109
who want to ask particular questions

470
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:52,009
that will enable them to browse the data

471
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:53,959
fairly effectively even in the context

472
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,349
of having these kind of fairly

473
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,600
complicated relationships between

474
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:01,699
between and within plant genomes so

475
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,769
we're really excited about our

476
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,140
development of this tool and hoping that

477
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:09,019
other groups will eventually start to

478
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,420
pick it up - alright so moving on to a

479
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,690
different example of challenges

480
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,279
associated with polyploidy this is a

481
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,259
genome sequence project that we've been

482
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,509
involved with for a number of years

483
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,960
actually more more years than I care to

484
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,900
admit

485
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,539
but it's been it's been a bit difficult

486
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:30,190
going both for technical and funding

487
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:33,680
reasons I guess but you know so we

488
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,140
alfalfa cultivated alfalfa is a species

489
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,080
that is an auto tetraploid and making

490
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,030
life more complicated still it's an out

491
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,339
crosser so there's a lot of diversity

492
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:47,750
within the genome itself it's related to

493
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:49,579
metacognitive cargo tranquila which is a

494
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,240
kind of a model of species for the

495
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:56,689
legumes and so you know if you if you

496
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,769
look at something like frequency spectra

497
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:03,289
in medicago you get a really clean

498
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:05,359
result showing you a sort of a plus on

499
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,369
distribution of your Kaymer frequencies

500
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,099
which is what you would expect from

501
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:12,619
single copy sequence content classically

502
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,599
and you can model things about genome

503
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,909
size and hetero zygosity which

504
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,069
effectively this has none using this

505
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,529
type of

506
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:23,589
set up when you try to do the same thing

507
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:26,889
with sativa things get a lot more

508
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:28,480
complicated in terms of the set of

509
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,570
camera Peaks that you're dealing with

510
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,480
and your attempt to fit models of those

511
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:37,029
kind of mixed model distributions of

512
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,569
Kaymer's present at different copy

513
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:41,889
numbers that you're sampling from a

514
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:44,710
large pool that you've generated from

515
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,870
whole genome shotgun sequencing well so

516
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,669
one thing that we did in that context

517
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:52,319
kind of similar maybe to the piano

518
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:55,390
genome there there was a diploid eyes

519
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,639
version of cultivated alfalfa that had

520
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,770
been taken from a tetraploid and made

521
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,929
into a diploid and we thought great this

522
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:04,839
will be simpler we can start with that

523
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,548
and then leverage it to help us with

524
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,970
when we're dealing with the tetraploid

525
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:11,679
itself all right so we had a we had a

526
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,589
lot of different data sets that we had

527
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,150
available or you know we started

528
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,428
thinking it would be easy with Illumina

529
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,048
sequencing and then as that proved not

530
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:23,169
to be the case we moved on to different

531
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:24,940
types of data so packed by a sequence

532
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,669
saying you I'm not exactly sure how

533
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,289
familiar you guys all are with next-gen

534
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:31,390
sequencing but you know there are a

535
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:34,029
number of different technologies not all

536
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,290
of them sequence based but they all have

537
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:39,039
kind of their strengths and weaknesses

538
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:41,649
with respect to getting at complex

539
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,250
genomes and so we've tried it tried a

540
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,140
number of things and one one thing

541
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,230
that's kind of a little bit unique about

542
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,679
Auto tetraploid z' in terms of using

543
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,720
linkage maps is that you do you do your

544
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
linkage mapping typically using say

545
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,400
single single dose heterozygotes would

546
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,009
be they sort of behave from that

547
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,110
perspective like diploid where it's this

548
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,490
or that segregating and you can just

549
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,439
keep your eye on the informative

550
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,390
haplotype and figure out how it's

551
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,600
segregating with other informative

552
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,450
haplotypes from the same linkage group

553
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,879
so I may be maybe trying to stretch that

554
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,970
algebraic analogy but you know as as you

555
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,970
as you think about roots of numbers that

556
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,798
are more than just square root where you

557
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,710
maybe you think about positive or

558
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,650
negative as you go to higher roots you

559
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,870
have to think about all of the different

560
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,310
directions in the complex plane that you

561
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:37,319
could be talking about when you're

562
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,799
talking about the the root of a number

563
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:46,139
so things things with genotyping get

564
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:50,490
more complicated as well so just trying

565
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,840
to get a handle on what the material was

566
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:57,029
in terms of you know what is it that

567
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,730
we're trying to assemble here do we we

568
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,349
essentially want to get eight

569
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,140
chromosomes like medicago house even

570
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:07,919
though we know there are 32 but for each

571
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:11,759
of the 32 four of them should be in some

572
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,950
sense homey oolagah stew one another but

573
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,690
at some level of diversity from one

574
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,860
another or do we really want a 32

575
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,720
chromosome sort of can genome within the

576
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:25,319
context of our single cultivar of

577
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,089
alfalfa you know and in some sense every

578
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,409
time you create a cross of alfalfa

579
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:31,199
you're gonna get a different combination

580
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,090
of these things so in some sense it's

581
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,880
kind of quixotic to try to get the

582
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:38,220
haplotypes but if your clone only

583
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,230
propagating at fuel you'll preserve them

584
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,259
at least and you can ask questions about

585
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,839
you know is is this technology suitable

586
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:49,759
for understanding issues of haplotype

587
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:52,529
phasing across long distances so

588
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,349
probably not surprisingly you know we

589
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:57,899
found that short read assemblies were

590
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:00,209
compressing things down a lot more

591
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,640
towards the expected haploid genome size

592
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:06,269
but there was a lot of fragmentation if

593
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,970
you think about your n 50 s relatives

594
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,710
and chromosome sizes they're they're not

595
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:15,269
looking very good even even with the

596
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,860
long read technologies the context sizes

597
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,139
that we're getting out of those are very

598
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:22,279
small not as small as the short reads

599
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,720
but at the level of smallness that it's

600
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,879
even challenging to kind of take some of

601
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,539
the other technologies and apply them to

602
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,420
them and the other thing is that the

603
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,210
long read assemblies you know were

604
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,130
definitely producing genomes that were

605
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,130
closer to capturing several of the

606
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,680
haplotypes not maybe all four but you

607
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,059
know and even in Kadel which we had

608
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,308
approached as a diploid

609
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,259
it would be simpler well it was in some

610
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:51,210
sense but still there's a lot of

611
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,028
heterozygosity there and enough that

612
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,490
with the high error rates combined with

613
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:58,288
the hetero zygosity there are a lot of

614
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,499
issues with actually dealing with long

615
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:03,329
reads and figuring out you know well is

616
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:05,579
this just a repeat is this Christian

617
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:09,778
high in highly arid sequence or is it

618
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:13,918
actually a divergent haplotype so anyway

619
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:15,599
when we when we finally kind of took one

620
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,820
of the long read assemblies as our base

621
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,498
then we started exploring kind of

622
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,589
higher-order genome scaffolding

623
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:25,679
technologies like optical maps or high C

624
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:27,538
of various flavors and what one of the

625
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,059
companies we worked with phased genomics

626
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,470
their algorithm basically you would tell

627
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,109
it how many chromosomes you wanted to

628
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,409
get out which some ways seems a little

629
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:38,939
bit of a danger sign but you know we

630
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,740
could tell them well we would like to

631
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,470
try it with 8 chromosomes would like to

632
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,700
try it with 32 and you can see that

633
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,499
there were there were some significant

634
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,999
differences and I will say not

635
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,879
differences that always made a lot of

636
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:52,829
sense to us and trying to do that I

637
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:56,579
talked a little bit about the camer

638
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:58,949
frequency spectra so you know depending

639
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,249
on how you what size you choose your cam

640
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,009
or at you will either pick up stuff that

641
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:06,868
is effectively single copy across all

642
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:09,450
the homologues and present at higher

643
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:11,009
frequencies and then smaller Peaks

644
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:16,499
representing things that are single

645
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:19,159
dosage or double dosage I think that you

646
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:22,558
know this this progression as you get

647
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:24,269
closer to you're using longer Kaymer's

648
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,269
and showing that your Peaks your

649
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,839
higher-order Peaks effectively are being

650
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,450
erased

651
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:34,230
you know it's effectively showing us

652
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:36,720
that they're within about 71 base pairs

653
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,700
you know you're going to get two snips

654
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,600
that actually differentiate between all

655
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:46,259
four haplotypes so it's it's quite a

656
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:49,740
complex genome to work with from an

657
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:52,230
assembly perspective but when you look

658
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,798
so these are the same so using 25 MERS

659
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,599
as our basis we're using kind of the

660
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:00,759
camer frequency plots against the

661
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,579
actual genomes that we've assembled and

662
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:06,009
looking to see well for Kaymer's that

663
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:09,879
are in this peak to capture them once as

664
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:12,879
expected or twice and I guess this is

665
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,640
actually the this is the peak of 4x

666
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,799
shared between all four haplotypes so

667
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,690
you might expect that to be captured at

668
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:22,269
4x and you know again it's not

669
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,710
surprising that what you see is that the

670
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:30,250
short read data tends to pick up this

671
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:32,980
you know single copy stuff and you know

672
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,950
some of the haplotypes are not being

673
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,269
represented so there at 0 X but it's

674
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:42,490
it's not really a simple picture and

675
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:44,048
even within Cadle where the the the

676
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,880
camera frequency plot looks a little

677
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,440
ragged because we don't have the same

678
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,620
depth of coverage because we're using

679
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,690
PacBio data which isn't as deep and you

680
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,459
can't you can't really use it prior to

681
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,019
correction which is one reason it

682
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,419
becomes less deep

683
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,879
I think things look complicated again as

684
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:04,419
you would expect with the hair as I

685
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,950
guess genome so boot busca analysis is

686
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,380
something that a lot of people do to

687
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,960
kind of assess how well their genomes

688
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,820
have done in terms of capturing genes

689
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,579
that are expected to be present in

690
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:17,769
single copy and of course whether or not

691
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:20,079
you expect it to be single copy as again

692
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:22,720
kind of relative to your expectation for

693
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,298
the ploidy level and the amount of time

694
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,650
things have had to become single copy

695
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:29,889
again following a whole genome

696
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:33,659
duplication event and you know in terms

697
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:36,309
of genic content again the short read

698
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,559
technologies in general well these are

699
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:42,279
different now assembly algorithms being

700
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,259
applied short read or long read and you

701
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,819
know again you can see that short read

702
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,129
technologies they're doing doing an okay

703
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:50,279
job of picking up gene content but just

704
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,380
you know basically making a single copy

705
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:56,048
whereas the longer read technologies are

706
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,230
picking up two or three copies of these

707
00:30:56,048 --> 00:31:02,168
things and when you when you look at

708
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,329
genes from medicago tranquila just

709
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:05,980
across the board for things that you

710
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,069
wouldn't necessarily expect to be in

711
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,519
single copy you get a somewhat simpler

712
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:16,169
picture but definitely um

713
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:19,349
more mornings appearing in multiple you

714
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:22,650
know for four or five or higher levels

715
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:26,189
of employee so not not a real change but

716
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:30,320
kind of tendency to be able to pick

717
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,320
multi copy gene families I suppose

718
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,740
alright so we had a well we had the

719
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:40,559
medicago trunk hatchling genome and

720
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:44,940
prior evidence made from genetic Maps

721
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:48,029
within sativa showed us that essentially

722
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,100
the two genomes are collinear despite

723
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:54,029
the fact that even at the haploid genome

724
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:56,579
size one is quite expanded almost twice

725
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:59,250
as big as the other one there are a

726
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:01,769
couple of interesting things that turn

727
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,920
out not to really be about differences

728
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:07,049
between styler and Frank axilla but the

729
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,360
particular accession that was chosen for

730
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,609
the genome sequencing of trunk Atua had

731
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,079
some peculiarities and they they show up

732
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:16,709
when you compare it to other tran

733
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:20,309
quechuas but when you when you you know

734
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:24,029
essentially try to use trunk a chola as

735
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:25,730
your basis you would you would expect

736
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:29,129
that it would do a pretty good job of

737
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:31,529
showing you collinearity and depending

738
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,740
on how fragmented your assembly is you

739
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:36,359
know i genome dot plots are a nice way

740
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,390
of showing relationships between

741
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,219
different genomes but when you see

742
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,770
something like this where you know the

743
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,900
labels of one axis are so dense that you

744
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:47,549
can't even read them it basically just

745
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,710
means that you've got a lot of degrees

746
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,389
of freedom that you have to make things

747
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:55,170
look like diagonals and if there are

748
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:57,090
real structural events going on between

749
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,550
your your genomes you're not likely to

750
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:02,730
see them but as you as you start

751
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:05,129
applying more aggressive scaffolding

752
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,549
technologies then you you get the chance

753
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,110
to be wrong and you know this this is an

754
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:11,819
example of some of the things that we're

755
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,549
coming out of the hi-c data where

756
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:17,189
they're doing a pretty good job of kind

757
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,579
of figuring out which chromosome a

758
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,710
particular scaffold belongs to I'm

759
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,759
getting it in the right neighborhood but

760
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,079
effectively what they're doing even

761
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,519
when you you tell them to kind of

762
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:34,419
produce 32 chromosomes is not really

763
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,660
give you 32 chromosome haplotypes but

764
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:41,140
give you each each of the 8 chromosomes

765
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,779
in 4 pieces where each of the pieces

766
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,970
kind of represents a strange little

767
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:48,549
jumble of all haplotypes that you had

768
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,470
for that because the hi-c data isn't

769
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:52,509
really able of resolving these kind of

770
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:54,309
haplotype phasing issues at least not in

771
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:57,039
the hands of the algorithm that was

772
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,389
applied to it so just zooming in on this

773
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,430
a little bit more on one of the

774
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,759
chromosomes you can you can start to see

775
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,380
on the one hand probably some assembly

776
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,050
artifacts that are coming in and from

777
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,730
some of the scaffolding technologies I

778
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,480
would I would not expect this to be a

779
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:15,849
real relationship between a alfalfa

780
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,360
scaffold and trunk Angela you see

781
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,529
another one of those sort of crow's-feet

782
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,039
representations there but you can also

783
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,080
clearly see you know we are picking up

784
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,539
fairly good representation of two

785
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,849
haplotypes along you know in many cases

786
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:35,320
along wide stretches and in some case

787
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:38,679
it's a little bit more fragmented again

788
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,769
if we take if we take our original non

789
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,720
scaffold just long read technologies you

790
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:45,940
can start to kind of trace a picture but

791
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,489
you have a lot of degrees of freedom to

792
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,250
make make this into little you know sort

793
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:54,219
of line segments that are showing you

794
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,730
collinearity as you apply something like

795
00:34:54,219 --> 00:35:00,069
optical mapping these lines become much

796
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,440
longer than more coherent and you know

797
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,620
these seem to represent appetites but

798
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,590
they're still kind of a question about

799
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,089
can you really trust that the phasing

800
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,220
that this is sort of saying that you

801
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,950
have along your haplotype is actually

802
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:16,539
accurate because you know by oh nano map

803
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:18,969
doesn't actually have sequence data

804
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:20,920
associated with it it's just a kind of a

805
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:24,099
pattern which we'll see in a another

806
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,190
slide so this this is the kind of

807
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:30,480
commish of haplotypes that the hi-c data

808
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:33,300
is producing for it for this region

809
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,360
again probably in the right general

810
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,960
vicinity but it's certainly not making a

811
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,849
single

812
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,909
here in haplotype as instructed by the

813
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:46,420
32 chromosomes and then if we apply a

814
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:47,769
high c-plus bio nano which kind of

815
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,869
allows you to make breaks where

816
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:54,730
necessary and you know what one one

817
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:56,289
limitation of the non sequence basis of

818
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,909
something like an optical map is that

819
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,039
your your scaffolds kind of have to be a

820
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:03,429
certain size to begin with in order for

821
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:06,489
them to get purchase into the genetic

822
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:11,409
map sorry no the optical map which I'll

823
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:13,689
show in another slide so this then again

824
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:16,809
is using using the same tool to look at

825
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,599
the haplotypes that we've derived from

826
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:22,960
that region and here's a just kind of

827
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,490
the crows foot sort of thing that we

828
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,409
were seeing in the dot plot looked at

829
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:28,989
from the genic perspective and turned on

830
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:30,659
its side for cattle so that that's what

831
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:34,000
I would consider to be an artifact

832
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:37,108
scaffold but we also see some kind of

833
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,269
interesting things within our alfalfa

834
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:42,819
blocks where you know this this is just

835
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:44,889
kind of a contact that the optical map

836
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,240
was not able to place probably because

837
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:48,279
it wasn't long enough and didn't have

838
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,679
enough restriction sites to really

839
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,530
create a pattern to put it into place

840
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:55,690
but you can you can basically imagine

841
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,240
that it fits right in there here's

842
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,920
another example where you have a little

843
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,319
region we didn't we didn't happen to

844
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,210
pick it up using the kind of synteny

845
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,849
based way of looking at things that

846
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,588
we're using here but another kind of

847
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,660
interesting question then again along

848
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:13,119
the same lines about well what what do

849
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:16,029
people who want to use in alfalfa genome

850
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,858
I really want out of a reference you

851
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,119
know the pretendin C would be to say

852
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:21,279
well let's just choose the longest

853
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,680
haplotype and kind of do a minimum

854
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,900
tiling thing and choose the most

855
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,750
contiguous and least redundant path

856
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,099
through those dot plots that we can but

857
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,530
there does seem to be a lot of evidence

858
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,920
that there's gene loss between the

859
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,540
different homologues as you know some

860
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,970
polyploid theory might lead you to

861
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,869
believe could be the case and so you

862
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:44,199
know if you just chose one

863
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:46,088
representative homolog then you might be

864
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,009
missing important gene content that was

865
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:50,230
actually present on another one of these

866
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,790
copies and so you know as I sort of

867
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,320
alluded to the fact that you've got kind

868
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:54,869
of a

869
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,860
a pan genome for the price of a single

870
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,960
genome with alfalfa and you know I'm I'm

871
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,210
thinking you know eventually we might

872
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,309
come to the place where instead of

873
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,369
thinking about single reference genomes

874
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:10,920
we think about consolidated references

875
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,670
that could basically take all the four

876
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,769
homologues

877
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,079
i've abstract them out into a single

878
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,820
representation that was maximally useful

879
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,670
for somebody actually trying to do

880
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,190
things in alfalfa

881
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,990
alright so optical maps turned out to be

882
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,329
a bit of a surprise for me

883
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:28,559
you know they I was thinking that they

884
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,659
wouldn't really have enough information

885
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,170
to be able to distinguish the homologues

886
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:35,849
but what we what we were seeing is that

887
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,010
when we took the original context and

888
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,319
then started placing them up against the

889
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,640
scaffolds that it would produce we saw

890
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,800
that they were kind of breaking the

891
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,109
context and distributing them across

892
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,000
different scaffolds and in a kind of a

893
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:51,480
pattern that suggested that maybe what

894
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,989
was going on was it was trying to make a

895
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,320
haplotype consistent phasing so this

896
00:38:54,989 --> 00:39:00,989
this is kind of what optical maps look

897
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,140
like you sort of do an in silico

898
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:07,319
digestion of your sequence data that

899
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,480
you've produced where wherever you know

900
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,130
the enzymes that you're using you find

901
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,110
their cut sites and you look at the

902
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:16,050
pattern that this would create and then

903
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,180
you look at all of the labeled molecules

904
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,370
that you've put together using assembly

905
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,919
like techniques and look at the patterns

906
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:26,089
that they show and so in this case we

907
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,000
can kind of see some clear regions where

908
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:33,390
maps created using different enzymes are

909
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,530
showing places where you get a very

910
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:40,409
clear crossover between the sequence

911
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:44,040
scaffold showing a pattern that's

912
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:46,079
associated with this map up to here and

913
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,599
this map up to here and then switches

914
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,069
over to not matching this one but

915
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,049
matching this other one which hadn't

916
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,150
measured before so that seems to be

917
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,310
pretty good evidence in my mind these

918
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:59,460
things are actually heterozygous enough

919
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:01,320
that the haplit haplotypes are actually

920
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,619
fairly well distinguished even when you

921
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,940
don't have the sequence information so

922
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,929
finally you know we're

923
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,150
we're trying to make use of these

924
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:12,538
genetic maps and even that's been a bit

925
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,309
of a challenge because the the markers

926
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:16,410
that were developed were developed using

927
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:18,059
one of the short read assemblies and so

928
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:21,899
those short reader assemblies kind of

929
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,730
represent little mosaic haplotypes even

930
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,130
within the context of you know fairly

931
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:28,588
short stretches of most flanking

932
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,140
sequence so what you'd kind of like to

933
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:34,199
do is to say well you know I know this

934
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,868
was a snip chosen because it had three

935
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,939
copies and you know three of the

936
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:40,588
homologues at one copy of an allele and

937
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,179
the other one so what I really want to

938
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:44,219
do is establish you know what's the

939
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:47,308
informative allele which linkage group

940
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:51,149
did it go to and do up it within the

941
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:53,849
context of the linkage phased sort of

942
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,700
representation of those snips am I also

943
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:59,099
phasing those particular alleles within

944
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,409
the context of sequence analysis and so

945
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,010
this is showing us a dot plot where the

946
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:07,440
different 32 linkage groups genetically

947
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,299
are being represented and you can you

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,750
can see that it's it's fairly collinear

949
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:15,298
with a little bit of noise off the

950
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,608
diagonal showing where a particular

951
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:20,068
allele you know really ought to be in

952
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:22,259
this linkage group that was actually put

953
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:25,739
into a scaffold with something else that

954
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,450
it doesn't really want and then finally

955
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:30,298
getting down to the actual sequence

956
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:33,028
level of the haplotypes it was a bit of

957
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:34,949
a surprise to me to see that at the end

958
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:35,730
of the day even though we didn't really

959
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:38,699
end up using

960
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:41,699
Kadel to be kind of a substrate for

961
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:44,519
working on the higher level putting

962
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,828
together of the tetraploid genome when

963
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,588
you start looking at the haplotype

964
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,269
structure that you have in terms of the

965
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:54,239
different things appearing in these two

966
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:57,838
genomes there actually it seems as

967
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,449
though you're seeing in some cases at

968
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,480
least similar haplotypes resolving out

969
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:05,730
of those two genomes which tamaak tum' i

970
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,349
I don't I don't know that much about the

971
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,048
history of Keadle but I don't think was

972
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:13,318
actually really derived in any way from

973
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:15,750
this material so that was kind of a nice

974
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:18,108
result and then up here we're kind of

975
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,940
showing what a most

976
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:23,420
sequence alignment tool for whole

977
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,059
genomes kind of does when you try to

978
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,298
give it things that actually have

979
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:31,160
multiple genome copies but you're just

980
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,929
sort of saying well you know take take

981
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:35,389
this species and align it here and I

982
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:37,489
expect there to really be one region but

983
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:40,129
it's finding it's finding that you've

984
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:41,900
given it several copies of this region

985
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,230
with different characteristics it's kind

986
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,588
of just mashing them into one consensus

987
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:54,409
like thing that is much more nicely

988
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:56,210
resolved down here alright so this is

989
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:59,118
the kind of the last example this

990
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,970
represents more recent work that it's

991
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,499
actually just a proposal that was

992
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:05,480
recently submitted that we've been

993
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:09,409
generating a lot of preliminary data on

994
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:13,969
and so you know people have been looking

995
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:18,409
at functional genomics omics data in

996
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:20,389
both tissues for a long time now and one

997
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:22,159
will you know it's great it's powerful

998
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,558
it provides us with a lot of information

999
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:28,909
but one problem is that you know in fact

1000
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:31,789
you've got a genome that in some sense

1001
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:33,379
is the same in all of these parts of the

1002
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:37,339
plant but it's doing different things

1003
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:42,548
and you know when when you aggregate

1004
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:44,480
things together you can obviously miss

1005
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:46,670
interesting things that might be going

1006
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,880
into parts and sometimes you can usually

1007
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:51,259
just get patterns which are actually the

1008
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,200
opposite when you look across the

1009
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:55,818
aggregate then the things within the

1010
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,768
meaningful subgroupings that you had

1011
00:43:55,818 --> 00:44:01,608
might might have related and that's

1012
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:03,498
called Simpsons Simpsons paradox so the

1013
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:06,108
question is you know well if we start

1014
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:09,518
looking at things at fine finer levels

1015
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:14,150
of resolution within a system a

1016
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:16,459
multi-cellular complex system will we be

1017
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,809
able to answer questions that we

1018
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,670
couldn't address when we were just

1019
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:22,309
looking at things in the aggregate and

1020
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:26,739
this is this is work that mark LeBeau

1021
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:26,739
has been spearheading

1022
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:32,068
so that just kind of giving a little bit

1023
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,230
more substance to what I was saying you

1024
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:36,808
know the root systems of these various

1025
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:40,949
species although they have in many cases

1026
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:42,990
the same cell types where cell type I'll

1027
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:45,328
just let you decide for yourself what

1028
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:47,098
that might actually mean they look

1029
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:50,460
pretty different in terms of their

1030
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:53,338
structure and the number of components

1031
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,009
of different types that they have so you

1032
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:58,949
can kind of easily imagine that when

1033
00:44:56,009 --> 00:45:01,469
you're averaging out in kind of

1034
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:04,919
different weighted averages across these

1035
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:07,798
different pools you would not really be

1036
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,019
able to compare all that easily across

1037
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:13,349
them in meaningful ways if you wanted to

1038
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:15,449
say look at even if you had done a kind

1039
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,970
of a carefully controlled experiment

1040
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,318
where you defined you know what what is

1041
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:22,709
the section of the route that is

1042
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:25,829
homologous and Arabidopsis to mikado so

1043
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,509
these other things you know you may just

1044
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:30,298
be limited in terms of the actual

1045
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:32,039
biology in terms of what what averaging

1046
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:34,288
is happening and so when you try to do

1047
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,599
comparisons in terms of evolutionary

1048
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,420
questions you just might not really have

1049
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,759
great data to work with

1050
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,190
so recently as I'm sure many of you are

1051
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,068
aware technologies that have been around

1052
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:50,639
in the animal space for a number of

1053
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:53,608
years have just begun to be applied to

1054
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,469
plants you know it's not it's not that

1055
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:57,889
we're slow on the uptake it's that we've

1056
00:45:55,469 --> 00:46:00,538
had you know real challenges in terms of

1057
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:04,858
cell walls and the ability to actually

1058
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:09,089
take plant tissue and dissociate the

1059
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:11,518
cells into say contexts in which you can

1060
00:46:09,088 --> 00:46:13,558
actually do single cell biology but

1061
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:16,469
within the last year a number of papers

1062
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:19,278
have come out including John chief

1063
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:21,449
Williams on the previous slide who's

1064
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:23,670
looked at a rabbit opposite root

1065
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:27,568
development for many years he published

1066
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,358
a paper using proto plasting on Arab

1067
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:34,768
adopts of root cells and basically

1068
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:36,480
created a Arab adopts us root Atlas from

1069
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:40,979
that data as a number of groups other

1070
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,920
groups have been looking at and the eye

1071
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:47,010
recently made aware of an effort that's

1072
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,019
there's a workshop happening soon to

1073
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,000
kind of start thinking about what it

1074
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:54,000
really means to generate a plant cell

1075
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,210
Atlas similar to the sorts of atlases

1076
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,338
that are being developed in say human

1077
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,929
and mouse other systems that are a

1078
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,119
little bit more mature in terms of these

1079
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:06,239
technologies so I think it's a really

1080
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,800
exciting area and something that you

1081
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,029
know I'm hoping that we'll get funded to

1082
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:15,119
work on so Mark's approach has been a

1083
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:17,670
little different in that he's he's

1084
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,220
working with single nucleus data rather

1085
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:23,430
than single cell or protoplast in single

1086
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:26,459
cell data and a number of the possible

1087
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:30,719
advantages to doing that are enumerated

1088
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,639
here so it's one of the ways that I

1089
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,209
relate this to the basic question of

1090
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,098
polyploidy and thank Jeff Doyle for

1091
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:41,338
turning me on to this question about

1092
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:43,109
what happens you know transcriptionally

1093
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:47,400
with cells that have different pendopo

1094
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:51,299
including levels you know a lot of these

1095
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:55,139
platforms will have different biases in

1096
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,539
terms of cell cell sizes that they're

1097
00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:00,358
able to actually incorporate into their

1098
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:02,190
micro fluidics or their droplets and so

1099
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:03,960
that's that's at least somewhat

1100
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,150
minimized with the use of nuclear data

1101
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,880
but I think I think at the end of the

1102
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:12,930
day it's probably just the fact that you

1103
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,160
don't have to tune your system as much

1104
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:16,289
when you're trying to go across

1105
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,379
different species working with the Knife

1106
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:22,739
nuclear isolation protocols so hopefully

1107
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,930
we will be at a point soon where we can

1108
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:28,189
actually engage in some of the

1109
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:30,419
comparative functional omics that we are

1110
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,849
hoping that these technologies will

1111
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,510
really start to bring to bear on these

1112
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:39,859
questions and we're you know we're

1113
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,859
thinking that a lot of the

1114
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,039
biological questions you know it may

1115
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:47,839
actually have slightly different kind of

1116
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:49,550
takes that you get when you're when

1117
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,920
you're restricting yourself to what's

1118
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,750
going on and nucleus but that that could

1119
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,300
be viewed you know in some cases is an

1120
00:48:53,750 --> 00:49:00,619
advantage rather than you know possibly

1121
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:03,110
just a difference there are some some

1122
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,279
real challenges to you know your when

1123
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,809
you're going to the single-cell level

1124
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,940
you're already faced with challenges

1125
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,799
with really low amounts of starting

1126
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,659
material and when you when you're

1127
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,940
limiting yourself to only what's going

1128
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:17,659
on from the nucleus it's it's even more

1129
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,280
challenging but you know the one basic

1130
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:21,409
question with using the single nucleus

1131
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,360
approach is well can we even get a

1132
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:25,909
picture of these systems that's

1133
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,380
comparable in some ways to what's coming

1134
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:30,469
starting to come out of the single-cell

1135
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:33,500
studies and so these are the kinds of

1136
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:35,239
pictures that are created by some of the

1137
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,550
informatics systems associated with

1138
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:40,909
single-cell essentially each data point

1139
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:43,220
is an individual cell and they're being

1140
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:45,049
spread out into this kind of

1141
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:46,639
two-dimensional projection you you can

1142
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:50,630
think about this sort of like a PCA

1143
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:52,759
except PCAs are kind of designed to look

1144
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:57,349
at the dimensions that maximize variance

1145
00:49:52,760 --> 00:50:01,040
across well what are the dimensions

1146
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:03,139
across which most variants occurs these

1147
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:06,219
techniques are a little bit more in

1148
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:08,420
tuned with looking at complex sorts of

1149
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:11,179
relationships where neighborhoods are

1150
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,550
more important T Snee was the one that

1151
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:15,109
people kind of started out using I first

1152
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:17,780
heard about it a couple of years ago tag

1153
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:19,579
and already it's been kind of started to

1154
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,180
be deprecated in favor of more

1155
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:25,250
sophisticated techniques but in any case

1156
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:27,349
you can see that if you if you do kind

1157
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:30,469
of a coke clustering that takes into

1158
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:32,839
account kind of possible batch effects

1159
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:36,259
between the different experiments and

1160
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,200
then you project them into the same

1161
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:42,680
space and then separate out the single

1162
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:45,439
cell dots from single nucleus dots you

1163
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:46,989
get you get a fairly you know coherent

1164
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,970
picture in terms of the overall

1165
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:52,759
structure where different areas are

1166
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:54,230
populated by both cells in nuclei

1167
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,510
but there are some things that we're

1168
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,579
picking up that don't seem to be present

1169
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:02,540
at all in the in the single-cell data so

1170
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:04,550
that it could be a case in which there

1171
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:07,608
are just certain cell types that are

1172
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:11,150
biased for whatever reason against being

1173
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:12,409
picked up in a fair plasting approaches

1174
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:17,180
that we're able to pick up with the

1175
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:18,618
nuclei when when it so it's you know

1176
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:22,578
it's fun to look at these plots

1177
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:24,500
sometimes it's okay if you can see four

1178
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,849
patterns but at the end of the day what

1179
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,588
you really want to do is to sort of

1180
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,000
figure out well what are these cell

1181
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:31,190
types and so if you're working in a

1182
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,358
rabid OPS's you know you have marker

1183
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,909
genes that have been established for

1184
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:36,858
cell types over many years and you can

1185
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:39,588
use the patterns of expression to kind

1186
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:44,210
of tease apart what these clusters

1187
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:49,639
likely represent biologically similarly

1188
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:52,070
in soybean which is paleo polyploid were

1189
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:56,029
we're able to sort of do do a similar

1190
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:58,150
thing figure out what the clusters

1191
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:01,040
represent and then start to look at

1192
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,990
effects of treatments like inoculation

1193
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,150
with sim buy on and show differential

1194
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:07,639
expression between the genes that are in

1195
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,289
the same cluster but being affected by

1196
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:11,150
the treatments differently and so I

1197
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:14,539
probably won't have too much time to

1198
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:17,300
talk about this but you know Jeff and I

1199
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:20,809
have worked since the early days of NGO

1200
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,730
sequencing on questions around well when

1201
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:25,369
you get when you get new polyploids

1202
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:26,030
being formed from hybridization of

1203
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,869
diploid x'

1204
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,790
and you come polyploid complexes

1205
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:33,740
essentially you call them Aalto until a

1206
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:35,599
but they're really different species

1207
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:37,759
different genomes different combinations

1208
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,088
of genomes what actually happens with

1209
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,270
the expression of these homeotic gene

1210
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:46,219
ohms together and can you access those

1211
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:48,170
questions using some of these sequence

1212
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:50,659
of sync technologies where sometimes you

1213
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,190
see you know one one homolog effectively

1214
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:54,348
gets suppressed and the other one is

1215
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,750
sort of dominant sometimes you get

1216
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:58,579
things like sub functionalisation and so

1217
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:01,690
we're trying to take the single-cell

1218
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:04,010
data and basically ask those questions

1219
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,929
by taking

1220
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,090
the data from the single cells that's

1221
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:12,469
been aggregated across the clusters and

1222
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:15,079
then defining indices that describe in

1223
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:17,899
terms of gene pairs related to one

1224
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:20,509
another through homie OG from ancient

1225
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,280
whole genome duplication events you know

1226
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:25,700
what what are the sorts of patterns that

1227
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,190
you can see so this is a case where for

1228
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:29,809
this particular gene pair sometimes one

1229
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,490
gene is the dominant partner sometimes

1230
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:33,949
the other gene is the dominant partner

1231
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:36,229
and sometimes you don't see any bias so

1232
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:37,609
you don't have enough read count data to

1233
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:39,860
really see significant bias

1234
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,690
sometimes you see clear preference one

1235
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,519
home you log over another and then

1236
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,950
similarly you know our different tissues

1237
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:49,969
different in terms of the ways in which

1238
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:52,069
they use different homologs to become

1239
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:54,949
the cells that they want to be through

1240
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:56,539
the developmental processes so finally

1241
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:59,059
you know in addition to transcriptomic

1242
00:53:56,539 --> 00:54:00,650
data we're using attack seek data which

1243
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:03,849
really is looking at chromosome

1244
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:07,309
structure and how how the chromosomes

1245
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:10,219
remodel themselves through interaction

1246
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:12,710
with the histones to try to make gene

1247
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:14,599
expression possible so there are some

1248
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,210
integrative techniques that have been

1249
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:19,000
developed similar to you know what you

1250
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:23,210
might use when you're trying to

1251
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,250
integrate say data set from one species

1252
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,929
to data set from another species you're

1253
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,659
kind of making some assumptions about

1254
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:31,909
you know what expression would look like

1255
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:33,279
with respect to the accessibility and

1256
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:35,299
genes that are being expressed

1257
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,070
integrating that way and then trying to

1258
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,450
figure out what the clustering is and

1259
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,670
then you can start asking questions

1260
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:43,250
about differential accessibility over

1261
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:45,320
the attack seek data aggregator across

1262
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,760
your clusters attack seek being even

1263
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,840
more sparse than the RNA seek data is so

1264
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,070
here are the people who I haven't

1265
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,769
already mentioned and of course this

1266
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:58,780
talk and just like to acknowledge on the

1267
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:58,780
various projects take questions

1268
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:05,239
[Applause]

1269
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:28,699
[Music]

1270
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:43,309
so I don't think a large amount of

1271
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:45,289
genetic kind of are whether or not it's

1272
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:57,829
missing pieces that actually contribute

1273
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:59,719
a lot so you know I would say it's not a

1274
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:01,789
question we've looked at carefully yet

1275
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:05,389
we haven't actually done a gene

1276
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:08,329
annotation of the tetraploid mostly just

1277
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:10,099
for reasons of running out of funding so

1278
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:11,900
the data I was presenting was actually

1279
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:13,670
taking the trunk actual genes and just

1280
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,740
projecting them onto the tetrachloride

1281
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,900
showing it from that perspective so

1282
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:19,849
there's a little bit of guesswork

1283
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,309
involved at that but you know in terms

1284
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:25,130
of the seeing fairly large deletions

1285
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:26,869
present in genic regions when you look

1286
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:29,780
at individual examples I would I would

1287
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:33,970
guess that it's not not uncommon to see

1288
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:52,760
those types of mutations changes being

1289
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:54,829
being maintained with him finding in

1290
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:03,650
terms of the similarity and self

1291
00:56:54,829 --> 00:57:06,440
clusters between right well that is a

1292
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:08,030
question I unfortunately can't address

1293
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,800
at this point mark mark has been very

1294
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,280
active in sort of taking the marker

1295
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,920
genes that he's

1296
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,450
studied and just establishing the

1297
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,220
identity of the cell clusters and I

1298
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:21,239
think you know our soybean data isn't

1299
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:23,009
yet that it's not as good as our Arab

1300
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,109
Dobbs data you know I said I said that

1301
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:26,820
the the nuclear data would involve less

1302
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:29,340
protocol tweaking but I think there is

1303
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:32,730
some protocol tweaking just in terms of

1304
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:36,030
basics sizes of nuclei for the larger

1305
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:38,849
genome he mentioned something about

1306
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:40,740
centrifugation being an issue so I'm

1307
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:49,799
imagining that there are some bursting

1308
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:51,569
issues that he's still working this has

1309
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:57,320
been a production of Cornell University

1310
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:57,320
on the web at Cornell edu
