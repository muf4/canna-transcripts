1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,080
University so first thank you very much

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,880
to The Graduate students of plant

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,000
breeding for inviting me it's always fun

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
to give a seminar to colleagues here on

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,160
the itha campus but it's especially nice

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:21,399
to be invited by graduate students uh

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,000
faculty love that so it is really nice

9
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,759
um also I apologize that I missed lunch

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
I thought lunch was after the seminar

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640
because that's what we do in Plant

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
Pathology so I hope you had a great

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
lunch without me

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,159
I'm a little bit sad about that I have

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,200
to admit um so I guess there's food in

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,119
Michael murk's lab that I can snag

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,600
afterwards uh today I I'm going to break

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,558
a a bunch of rules that I give my

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,160
graduate students when I help them

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,039
develop their seminars um the first rule

21
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,358
being you should never talk about one

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,160
more than one pathosystem it just gets

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:01,280
too confusing and everyone gets confused

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:03,238
but with the title um A Tale of Two Pho

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,079
you can uh get the idea that I am going

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,079
to be talking about two pathos systems

27
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,920
today and we'll see how that goes so um

28
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,959
uh the symptoms that you see on the

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,159
title slide here are symptoms of the two

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:20,639
pathos systems uh here on the left hand

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,000
side is phyo blight caused by phyto

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,879
capsy and in the center and on the right

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,078
hand side you see uh phyto infestans

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,519
which causes late blight of potato and

35
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,639
tomato which which is Infamous uh for

36
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,000
being the pathogen involved in the Irish

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,000
Potato

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,438
Famine so uh before I really got into

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,640
the projects I did want to mention um a

40
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,959
little bit about some of the other

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,560
projects ongoing in my lab in case any

42
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,959
of you folks are interested I'd be uh

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,560
happy to discuss I am a vegetable

44
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,679
pathologist my job is to study all of

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,680
those diseases that occur above ground

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,240
on vegetables in the state of New York

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,759
and there seems to be more and more

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,000
every year um for a lot of years I

49
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,519
worked on bacterial and O myy pathogens

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,438
and we still have some bacterial

51
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,359
projects uh we look work a lot on

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,000
cabbage cabbage is a major vegetable

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,280
crop going grown here in New York um and

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then tomato also uh bacterial Speck and

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,800
bacterial canker in bacterial canker we

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,639
have some interesting projects looking

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,599
at the movement of the pathogen within

58
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,479
the plant we do uh as Lauren said a lot

59
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,719
on pathogen detection and then

60
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,799
population studies today I'll talk about

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,318
uh phyto capsican infestans we do as

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,519
again Lauren said we also work on

63
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,919
cucurbit downy mildew and then in recent

64
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,800
years I've started some projects on the

65
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:40,878
true fungi um uh including alterar leaf

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,159
spot on Braska crops um brown leaf mold

67
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,679
on tomato which hits uh High tunnel

68
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,399
Tomatoes particularly hard and uh the

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
newest project in my lab is a mamser

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,640
rust project it's a willow rust on shrub

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,598
Willow which is now a vegetable in the

72
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,598
state of New York um

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,318
so um so uh I also do a lot of work with

74
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,839
Growers I spend about half of my time

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,479
working with uh Growers and uh helping

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,080
them manage and control their diseases

77
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,878
in both conventional and organic

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,920
production I have a very large outre

79
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,039
outreach program uh to the general

80
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,798
public including home gardeners uh

81
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,239
Community Gardens and uh kada2 project

82
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,360
this is our uh local K to2 project we

83
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,840
help the elementary school with their

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,319
garden and then um this semester I'm

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
teaching a course called skills for

86
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,399
public

87
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:39,399
engagement so on to the phy uh on the

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,360
left we have phyo blight on the right we

89
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,200
have L blight uh you might think that

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
they're very similar diseases they look

91
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,719
pretty similar in culture while they

92
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,438
grow on different media they look fairly

93
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,438
similar the symptoms you see here uh

94
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,400
both on this tomato leaf and on this

95
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,280
pumpkin are the asexual spores of the

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,719
pathogen both pathogens are om my seats

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,719
they're not true fungi please don't call

98
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,878
them true fungi they're in an entirely

99
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,639
different Kingdom and even though they

100
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,438
look in culture like a true fungus

101
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,518
they're really very very different type

102
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,479
of organism I'll bring out some of those

103
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,120
differences as the talk goes

104
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,879
on the host strange of the two pathogens

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,519
uh is is really quite different and

106
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,478
that's the first area that really

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,280
separates the two out here in New York

108
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,719
and and elsewhere um phyo capsy has a

109
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,959
much broader Host range so it attacks

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
all cucurbits almost all of the Solon

111
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,478
acious crops but not potato uh snap

112
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,520
beans and a whole diverse array of weeds

113
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,399
here are some of the symptoms uh showing

114
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,599
fruit rots here on the bottom of the

115
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,079
slide I should be using this so people

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,720
in Geneva can see um and on the right

117
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,240
hand side um is The Host range of phyto

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,479
infestans it does have a much more

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,478
limited Host range um the big ones are

120
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,120
potato and tomato it also goes to

121
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:59,199
petunia The Nightshade weeds um all

122
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,680
these scious guys Nana benana is a

123
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,639
popular ababat uh for p inestan work um

124
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,720
but with even within the solonus it does

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,720
not attack Pepper or eggplant um I think

126
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,000
the fact that infestans doesn't attack

127
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
Pepper or eggplant and uh capsy does not

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,839
attack potato is really fascinating and

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,079
that's one of the areas that I'd really

130
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,159
like to study um over the next 20 years

131
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,758
but I'm not right

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,039
now um so when I I was talking to some

133
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,360
breeders about this and and someone

134
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,038
actually told me

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,400
it broke my heart but someone actually

136
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:38,240
told me please please please don't show

137
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:42,079
us those darn life cycles we don't

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,199
care and I totally care but I don't get

139
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,478
that I get that you guys don't care so

140
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm just going to show you the

141
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,879
highlights if you need more come see me

142
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,758
uh so there are some really important

143
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,560
aspects of the life cycles in New York

144
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,840
of both of these pathogens each pathogen

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,360
is heterothallic that means you need two

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,079
mating types in order to make the sexual

147
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,639
overwintering structures so um we

148
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,279
cleverly call the mating types A1 and A2

149
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,038
each mating type can make both the male

150
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,079
and female parts but you have to have

151
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,759
both of those mating types in order to

152
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:21,959
get the overwintering sexual spores with

153
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,000
phy capsy every field we tested has both

154
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,279
mating types we have a sexually

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,918
reproducing overwintering population

156
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,239
throughout the state of New

157
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,839
York in pH

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,478
infestans the LEL pathogen this is a

159
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:41,038
very clonal population in the US that is

160
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,639
while in Mexico and other parts of the

161
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,360
world both mating types exist and you

162
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,038
have sexually reproducing populations

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,400
here in the US our populations are

164
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:57,120
clonal in any given year we'll have one

165
00:06:52,399 --> 00:07:00,799
or two or three clonal lineages that um

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,478
predominate the epidemic that we see but

167
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,560
we don't only rarely see only rarely do

168
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,318
we see sexual reproduction so we don't

169
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,000
have o spores in the soil so capsy life

170
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,120
cycle it over Winters in the soil

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,839
infestans not so

172
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,680
much um so asexual reproduction is

173
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,359
really really important uh phy the

174
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,000
direct translation is plant destroyer

175
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
and the reason phyas are such excellent

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,360
plant destroyers is because of their

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,038
explosive asexual reproduction

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
capabilities so uh these are sporangia

179
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,279
these are what that white fuzz on the

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,279
tomato leaf or that powdered sugar

181
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,439
appearance on the fruit those are the

182
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,279
asexual

183
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,279
spanga under the right conditions uh

184
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:52,000
each sporangium will produce zo spores

185
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:55,399
that can swim capsy when when these guys

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,959
get wet will produce 20 to 40 swimming

187
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,198
zo spores whereas infestans that'll be 6

188
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,519
to8

189
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,598
zoospores are incredibly interesting

190
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,000
structures and I won't bore you with

191
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,680
immense amount of details but there are

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,879
a couple of cool things that you need to

193
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,560
know um zoospores on their abaxial

194
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,599
surface they have two flagella they're

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,720
bagate which makes them unique among

196
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:25,000
many modal structure modal spores in

197
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,599
nature so they're bagate and the

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,158
anterior flagellum is actually tinsel

199
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:35,519
and the posterior is not the anterior

200
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,759
flagellum actually pulls the zoospore

201
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,080
forward right you know in most swimming

202
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,679
spores you have a flagellum and it acts

203
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,839
like a tail and it moves along but that

204
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,239
is totally not how these guys work they

205
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,839
do the front crawl and that posterior

206
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,080
flagellum actually acts as a Rudder and

207
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,200
in some species they're chemotactic so

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,959
that Rudder can direct them directly to

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,000
the root Zone where they want to attack

210
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,000
and kill the plant so oh my seats are

211
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:10,159
cool so how do they spread so uh phyo

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,519
capsy being that it's in the soil it

213
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,000
spreads in the soil with movement of

214
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,440
soil and with water uh oh my seats the

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,759
common name would be a water mold and

216
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,839
these guys really do love water caps SE

217
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,639
will move wherever water moves it and

218
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,120
wherever someone moves the

219
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,679
soil thankfully there is no aerial

220
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,759
dispersal

221
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,000
they cannot move through the air and

222
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,360
that is really one of

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,039
the Achilles heel of this pathogen that

224
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,959
enables us to manage it at all in New

225
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,719
York uh capsy uh as I said it can move

226
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,278
in water whether it's Splash dispersal

227
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,879
of water flood waters uh and then on

228
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,000
soil cultivation between fields and on

229
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,958
movement of in infected fruit which is a

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,480
very common way that it gets moved from

231
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,439
Farm to farm infestans is all about that

232
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,079
aerial dispersal

233
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,640
this is a picture of a tomato leaf and

234
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:08,479
you see the spanga on the bottom there

235
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:11,278
there're these tiny lemon-shaped guys

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,039
and they actually stick up off the leaf

237
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,200
surface and when the humidity changes so

238
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,039
for example if I had a detached leaflet

239
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,640
in a Petri dish high humidity took that

240
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,838
lid off you decreased the humidity the

241
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:27,958
spria actually twist it's completely

242
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,440
awesome they twist and they deiss or

243
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,518
they break off from from the Spang for

244
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,720
on the leaf and that's how they become

245
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,679
airborne and they can fly for miles in

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,680
the wind so the methods of dispersal of

247
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:44,439
these two pathogens are very different

248
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,278
so uh the infestans because it's

249
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,680
aerially dispersed and it's not in the

250
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,078
soil then how how does it survive here

251
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,638
in New York well it tends to survive

252
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:57,000
over winter in potato tubers so the T

253
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,519
the pathogen can live inside that tuber

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,120
that might be left in the soil or

255
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,600
sitting in a Culp pile um it also uh can

256
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,879
get around by movement of infected

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,680
plants tubous fruit and sadly by

258
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,919
humans sometimes in trucks as we saw in

259
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,120
2009 many of your Tomatoes may have died

260
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,958
from LEL light uh that was due to

261
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,159
movement of infected tomato transplants

262
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,159
in

263
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,639
trucks so one of the things that I have

264
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:31,360
to do every year as part of my job is

265
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,639
when there is total crop failure as is

266
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,720
seen with phyto capsy on this acorn

267
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,680
squash here on the left or with this

268
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,120
potato field when phy infestans on the

269
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,319
right I tend to get called out by the

270
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,519
extension Educators to the field talk to

271
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,000
the grower try to figure out what went

272
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,039
wrong how we can fix it in the future

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,399
and that's a really hard thing to do

274
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,480
because I'm standing there trying to

275
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,278
educate but I get paid whether or not

276
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,240
their crop dies and this person is

277
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,639
dealing with the significant e economic

278
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,759
loss so one of the things that I have

279
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,879
come to realize is that it's after these

280
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,879
experiences of interacting with Growers

281
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,559
after significant crop loss on that

282
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,399
drive home that's when I really tend to

283
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,958
come up with the questions that my lab

284
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,799
is focusing on now so the questions many

285
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:24,559
of the questions in my lab are really

286
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,159
driven by crop failures in the field and

287
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,599
trying to figure out what can we do to

288
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,759
you know to study and find out more

289
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,759
information to prevent this into the

290
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,759
future

291
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:42,519
see so here are some of the questions

292
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,159
that I'm going to cover today um with

293
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:49,600
phyto capsy which has both sexual and

294
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,278
asexual reproduction in the field um

295
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
questions that Growers always ask you

296
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,240
guys will be heartened to know that no

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,480
matter the disease Growers almost the

298
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,959
first thing they ask is are there

299
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,320
resistant varieties so your work is

300
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,319
being used please continue to breed

301
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,040
resistant

302
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,879
varieties um then in in terms of phyto

303
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,399
capsy phyto blight you know what happens

304
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,519
when the pathogen arrives I have it on

305
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,759
my farm you tell me it's mine to keep

306
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,320
it's not going anywhere what do I do now

307
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,439
how long will the pathogen stay in the

308
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,399
soil uh really commonly asked question

309
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,000
is the pathogen resistant to the

310
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,559
fungicides that I use and will the

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,679
pathogen be able to overcome that host

312
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,078
resistance that you're suggesting that I

313
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:44,000
use with Pho infestans because the

314
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,278
pathogen really doesn't survive on Farm

315
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,440
unless you're keeping tubers that you

316
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,600
shouldn't be keeping uh the common

317
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,759
questions are what strain of the

318
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,920
pathogen do I have because we have these

319
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,560
asexual clonal lineages people want to

320
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,838
know um what strain do I have because we

321
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,799
know based on the clonal lineage

322
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,639
is it does it prefer potato or tomato

323
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,639
what fungicides is it resistant that

324
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,919
clonal lineage gives us some information

325
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,600
about that strain of the pathogen are

326
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,120
there resistant varieties uh again uh

327
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,480
what about fungicides uh where does the

328
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,278
pathogen come from every year that is a

329
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
question that um advisory panels ask

330
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,198
Growers panel Growers ask where does

331
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,278
this come from um and then uh again will

332
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,679
the pathogen be able to overcome host

333
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,759
resistance and um

334
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
with phyo infestans sadly there is a

335
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,560
very long history of the pathogen

336
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
relatively quickly overcoming host

337
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,079
resistance uh so we'll start with our

338
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,600
sexually reproducing phy capsy that

339
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,359
causes phyto blight stay with me we're

340
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,759
going to have a a little series on phyto

341
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,560
blight now um I started working on phyto

342
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,720
blate in 2006 because there had been uh

343
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,518
several large outbreaks the pathogen had

344
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,600
been in New York for decades um but just

345
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,480
a a small problems in Upstate New York

346
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,639
with significant problems down on Long

347
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Island however um starting

348
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,560
in 2004 2005 there was some really big

349
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,879
epidemics and the reason for that is

350
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,278
because around that time we started to

351
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,360
have a change in our climate rather than

352
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,720
having a quarter inch of rain a week

353
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,120
throughout the summer we got large rain

354
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,199
ex rain events that that art Deaton

355
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
calls extreme weather events where we

356
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,359
would get two or more inches of rain at

357
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,920
a time so with a water mold you can

358
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,120
imagine that if you get two or more

359
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,399
inches of rain at a time flooding and

360
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,639
puddling in fields those water molds go

361
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
crazy and once you get an outbreak on

362
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,639
one or two Farms then because the

363
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,560
pathogen moves in water and in diseased

364
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,600
fruit and on tractor tires it really

365
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,599
starts to spread around so what we have

366
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,720
learned since we started working on it

367
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,159
is that uh as I said earlier we have

368
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,079
sexually reproducing po populations in

369
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,919
every field in New York that we've

370
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,479
tested uh the pathogen is very

371
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,240
genetically diverse which is not

372
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,440
surprising given that it's sexually

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,159
reproducing um there are Regional

374
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,199
differences in fungicide sensitivity

375
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,318
which is interesting um in the Eastern

376
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,879
side of New York we have some fungicide

377
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,799
resistance to a very commonly used

378
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,318
fungicide whereas in the western part of

379
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,278
New York we don't um we have we did a

380
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,399
significant survey I had a student work

381
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,078
on trying to figure out what what Waters

382
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,919
surface waters in New York uh phyo caps

383
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,120
could be found in and we could find it

384
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,919
she could find it almost everywhere um

385
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,839
irrigation ponds streams the Erie Canal

386
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,439
which people use for irrigation so any

387
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,000
irrigation Source we could find the

388
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,680
pathogen um present in flood waters boy

389
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
after um hurricane remnants from Irene

390
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,399
and Lee and then superstorm standy there

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,039
were many many farms in Eastern New York

392
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,360
that had never had phyto capsy before

393
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,278
that now have the pathogen

394
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,440
uh we learned something about resistance

395
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,119
working with Michael Mich in his lab we

396
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,600
know that some pepper varieties are

397
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,639
resistant to New York isolates we're

398
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,958
working on getting more but there is

399
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
currently no commercially available uh

400
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,480
resistance in cucurbits and again uh

401
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,119
along with uh Michael maerk and my Gore

402
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,078
were were working on that and trying to

403
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,479
identify some resistance in the

404
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,038
cucurbit so that takes out some of our

405
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,880
questions but some of the questions

406
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,879
still remain what happens when the

407
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,360
pathogen arrives into a new field that

408
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,720
had never been infected for and how long

409
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:36,759
will that pathogen stay in the

410
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,720
soil so one of the really interesting

411
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,240
things about this project is that the

412
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,720
growers in the state of New York

413
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,120
especially Upstate were really wanting

414
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,558
someone at Cornell to study phyto capsy

415
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,000
Magrath down on Long Island had has done

416
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,399
a lot of work but the soils are

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,679
different there the climate is different

418
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,440
there and no one on on either the iore

419
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,759
Geneva campuses had been working on this

420
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,600
pathogen

421
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,839
one of the reasons is that none of

422
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,599
Cornell's land was infested with the

423
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,319
pathogen and it I found out that you

424
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,879
know those Horticultural scientists and

425
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:14,558
plant breeders aren't that enthusiastic

426
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,320
about the plant pathologist inoculating

427
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,000
our Cornell land with a pathogen that

428
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:23,639
has an extremely broad Host range that

429
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,200
never goes away go figure I was shocked

430
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,240
um so uh The Growers actually work

431
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,360
together with um legislators Albany and

432
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,599
we had a blight Farm built in Geneva New

433
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,839
York about a quarter of a mile from my

434
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,719
office which is totally awesome there

435
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,038
were some there were nine acres of very

436
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,319
swampy land that Cornell was happy to

437
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,759
have me use for a blight Farm you can

438
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,279
see an Arial Photo of it there on the uh

439
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,839
left this is an outline of the blight

440
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:57,000
Farm here we do a lot of pepper trials

441
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,319
you can see oh shout out to the Missour

442
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,798
lab these are the controls and these are

443
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:06,000
some of mich's peppers there look pretty

444
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,558
good um and we have a barn so because

445
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,679
the pathogen uh survives in the soil you

446
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,918
don't want to use the equipment that the

447
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,519
plant breeders and the Horticultural

448
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,559
scientists might use so we have uh

449
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,319
equipment a barn anything that we might

450
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:23,200
need to do trials on our N 9 Acre Farm

451
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,119
is part of the farm stays there so

452
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,200
that's where we have been doing

453
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:33,000
research okay but but that soil did not

454
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,798
have any of the pathogen in it either so

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,558
how do you inoculate a farm with a

456
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,440
pathogen you know there's not actually

457
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:46,279
that much scientific literature on that

458
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,038
again I I we searched um but in 2008 we

459
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,918
came up with this idea that thankfully

460
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:53,759
worked um we grew uh two different

461
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,080
strains of the pathogen the A1 and the

462
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:01,319
A2 the two mating types in um Big 5 L

463
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,918
flasks that were filled with vermiculite

464
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,879
that had been saturated with V8 juice

465
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,440
this pathogen loves V8 juice so we had I

466
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,200
think we had 50 flasks of each isolate

467
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,400
growing in sterile conditions and

468
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,960
inoculated them and then we took those

469
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,360
and we mixed them up in these very uh

470
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:25,120
scientific plastic garbage

471
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:27,439
bags and we took that cocktail and

472
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,239
spread it around this beautiful

473
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,679
beautiful p pumpkin patch it was an

474
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,079
absolutely gorgeous pumpkin patch on

475
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,519
September

476
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:42,038
8th and October 9th we had

477
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:45,279
Victory so I have to admit that while I

478
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,640
it I truly hate seeing this on a grower

479
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,879
Farm on our research farm this is

480
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,840
absolute

481
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,559
Victory so we were really excited and

482
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,918
happy that we had killed this pumpkin

483
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,279
patch um all of the plant breeders and

484
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,640
Horticultural scientists were a little

485
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,079
bit nervous nervous when they saw this

486
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,759
and they were thankful that we were on

487
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:07,079
our farm um but this was the start of a

488
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,519
biparental population that we have

489
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,839
studied over time this is Marin

490
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,000
Carlson's uh slide and I I use it it's

491
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,399
just absolutely fantastic to demonstrate

492
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,679
what we're looking at in this particular

493
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,200
field so we have our Victory Field here

494
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:24,400
on the left that was inoculated with the

495
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,798
A1 and the A2 strain so in

496
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,559
2008 it was inoculated and then in the

497
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,679
spring of 2009 is the first time we

498
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,200
started to collect isolates we collect

499
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,640
isolates by planting a susceptible host

500
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,679
in the field they get diseased we bring

501
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,679
some of that diseased tissue in culture

502
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,400
the pathogen and that's how we get the

503
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,559
strains the tricky thing is we really

504
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,159
don't know the generation of the

505
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,798
pathogen in the field because those o

506
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,080
spores can survive in the field for a

507
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:59,038
very long time you can have an f1o spore

508
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,480
from the first year germinate

509
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,240
and mate with an oore that was produced

510
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,079
in 2012 so we really don't know anything

511
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,359
about who's mating with whom after that

512
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,359
first

513
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,759
inoculation so what are we doing in our

514
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,879
biparental field

515
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,359
population really one of the things we

516
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,880
really wanted to ask was how long will a

517
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,079
founding oor population

518
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,278
survive um do we observe Generations can

519
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,000
we observe Generations over time is

520
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,240
there

521
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,519
selfing um so the way we did this was we

522
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,400
collected somewhere between 30 and 50

523
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,400
isolates each year uh from 2009 to 2015

524
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,880
and in the beginning uh my graduate

525
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,919
student Amara Dunn used micro satellite

526
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,559
analysis there was a paper from South

527
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,200
Africa that had five microsatellite Loi

528
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:50,918
which remarkably was more than enough

529
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,440
for us to identify variation in the

530
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,200
population she saw variation in

531
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,600
genotypes irregular patterns of

532
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,319
inheritance which is not unusual for the

533
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,119
genus phyto

534
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:04,158
um and appearance of Novel Al within

535
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:08,599
three three years novel microsatellite

536
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,320
Al we also did an F1 cross in the lab to

537
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:14,038
use as a control to know what an F1

538
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:16,319
population actually looked like but we

539
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,759
knew that we needed more than five

540
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,079
markers so when you need more markers

541
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:26,038
what do you do you do

542
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:27,839
GBS that's what we do right so uh we

543
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,038
since that time Marin Carlson took over

544
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,879
the project

545
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,720
and we have 157 individuals from the

546
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,559
field 43 individuals from our F1 lab

547
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,720
cross and um we've done genotyping by

548
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:44,639
sequencing um The genome of phyo capsy

549
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,120
is about 64 megabases uh we used AP K1

550
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,120
which seemed to work fine for our

551
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,719
purposes um some people that are working

552
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,959
with phyto find that AP K1 doesn't give

553
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,079
them enough cut sites but it was fine

554
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,240
for our purposes um Marin was able to

555
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,839
identify about 400,000 Snips before

556
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,000
filtering and after her filtering um

557
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,678
we're now using about

558
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
6,500 so what do we see again um Marin's

559
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,200
data uh we have the A1 parent in blue up

560
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,558
on the top the A2 parent on the bottom

561
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,679
this is a principal components analysis

562
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,399
um with those 6,500 Snips and uh what

563
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,519
you see is different colored dots um

564
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,759
ranging from 2009 to

565
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,558
2013 which is how far we've gotten to

566
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,440
date and then in magenta are the

567
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,359
products of the lab cross that we know

568
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,080
are

569
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:41,839
F1 so happily we saw sort of what we

570
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,678
expected to see more or less from a pop

571
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,558
a biparental population the progyny are

572
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,559
somewhere in between the two parents

573
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,240
there's a couple of interesting uh

574
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,519
individuals here uh these are actually

575
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,880
three individuals from the lab cross

576
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,960
that Mara my previous student had

577
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,278
identified with the five low to be

578
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,278
selfed and Marin found the same thing uh

579
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,398
and then these were two that had not

580
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,880
been previously identified and these are

581
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:11,000
actually uh from the field individuals

582
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,640
from the field that are also identified

583
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,720
as self that is uh one parent mating

584
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,399
with itself because uh in the

585
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,278
heterothallic my each individual can

586
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,319
produce both the oogonium the female

587
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:27,640
part and the anthum the male part they

588
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,639
can self um and so that's that's how uh

589
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,360
we got those individuals out there kind

590
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,320
of interesting Marin has done some

591
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,199
really interesting work on those uh but

592
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,879
for the purposes of this seminar what we

593
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,038
were really looking for was how long do

594
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,080
those original founding o spores stay in

595
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:48,038
the field so what we have in this violin

596
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:51,158
plot is our f1s on the right hand side

597
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,839
we know that they're f1s um the first

598
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,640
time we were able to collect isolates

599
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:59,240
was 2009 uh and so in 2009 and 2010 uh

600
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,159
the heteros osity which is what you're

601
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:06,120
looking at here was very similar to what

602
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,840
we saw with f1s starting in 2011 this is

603
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,278
really great um what we see is that

604
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,079
there are some individuals that have a

605
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:17,640
level of heterozygosity similar to that

606
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:21,199
of the f1s but then we're starting to

607
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,960
see some individuals that have less

608
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,720
heterozygosity which would be an

609
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,440
indicator of inbreeding what we also see

610
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,120
is as we move into 2012 and 20 13 is

611
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,519
again a reduction in heterozygosity so

612
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,359
we're looking at inbreeding and now

613
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,319
while this isn't really surprising this

614
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,879
is actually the first time that we've

615
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,558
been able to show this for a field

616
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,399
population of phyto capsy so it's really

617
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,079
kind of exciting it'll be really fun to

618
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,558
see what happens in the next several

619
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,199
years if we continue uh to see a

620
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,879
reduction in het heterozygosity or if it

621
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,600
levels off because we are selecting for

622
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,080
those individuals that can kill a plant

623
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,240
right we we only can collect isolates on

624
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,119
a plant that is dying from symptoms so

625
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,839
because we're selecting we're probably

626
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,158
losing individuals that are no longer

627
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,079
pathogenic so it'll be interesting to

628
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,080
see what happens in this

629
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:19,200
field so uh what have we learned from

630
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,919
our GBS with the biparental population

631
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,720
uh we have found that the founding oor

632
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,840
stay for about 3 years based on Marin's

633
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,038
work there are there are individuals

634
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:32,199
that appear to be f1s for about three

635
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:36,480
years um and the inbred o spores uh are

636
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,038
there for longer and then uh how so

637
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,759
that's what happens when it arrives and

638
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,879
that's also how long we think the

639
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:46,519
pathogen will stay in the soil now again

640
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,960
because of selection um we we don't know

641
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,079
that this is exactly what would happen

642
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,519
in a grower field but we do hope to

643
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:57,359
compare these data to what we see in a

644
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,359
grower field uh as time goes on

645
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,559
so what's next in with the phyto capsy

646
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,240
which has the sexual reproduction well

647
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,359
we need additional studies um on the

648
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,798
genetics actually Marin is doing a lot

649
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,918
of really fascinating additional studies

650
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,000
on the genetics of this biparental

651
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:21,799
population as I said earlier phyto capsy

652
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,038
is known to have um interesting genetics

653
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,558
um so uh she's actually able to use this

654
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,919
population to learn more about loss of

655
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:33,119
heterozy osity Gene conversion um and

656
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,559
and it's it's really uh been fun to

657
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,278
learn more about the pathogen in this

658
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,240
field setting uh as I said we also want

659
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,319
to compare our research field to grower

660
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,759
Fields sadly there are more than enough

661
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,359
grower fields for us to compare to um

662
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,679
and then uh Marin is actually doing uh

663
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,959
an association study to look for a

664
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,880
region associated with mating type um

665
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,319
but there are other phenotypes that we

666
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,278
will certainly want to look for in the

667
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:02,119
future uh such as fungicide resistance

668
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:05,919
or uh effectors that enable um the

669
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:09,439
pathogen to more effectively attack the

670
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,960
host so we are now going to switch gears

671
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,720
and talk about asexual reproduction for

672
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,519
a little while so this is a whole new

673
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,480
system similar yet completely different

674
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,599
so we're switching to P infestans it's

675
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,000
aerially dispersed but there's and

676
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,519
people have been studying phyto

677
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,038
infestans for6 65 years but it's still

678
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,558
one of the most feared pathogens of

679
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:39,398
tomato and potato Growers across the

680
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,599
world it it's it's a frustrating system

681
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:44,759
to work with research researchers are

682
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,558
frustrated and Growers are frustrated so

683
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,558
one of the biggest questions that the

684
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,918
first question a grower asks is what

685
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,759
strain do I have as I said earlier

686
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,360
because these are

687
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,519
asexual uh asexually propagated you have

688
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,959
these colonal lineages and um people

689
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:01,120
want to know what strain do I have

690
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,120
because that will help them know what

691
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,119
fungicides to use what host to plant

692
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,798
things like that are there resistant

693
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,199
varieties uh is the pathogen resistant

694
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,079
to commonly used

695
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
fungicides and this is a very

696
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,079
interesting question where does the

697
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,278
pathogen come from every year if it's

698
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,918
not coming from our soil um and then

699
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,679
finally will the pathogen be able to

700
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,240
overcome the host

701
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:26,759
resistance so these are data from Bill

702
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,960
Fry's lab and um he as as many of you

703
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:34,200
know is probably the the world expert in

704
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,960
research on phyto infestans and one of

705
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,679
the things that Bill's lab has studied

706
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,440
for a very long time are these clonal

707
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,679
lineages these asexually reproducing

708
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,919
populations and what this slide shows is

709
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,440
uh his ability to identify quickly

710
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,399
clonal lineages and the change in clonal

711
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,759
lineages lineages over time so for

712
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:58,199
example in the potato graph we have from

713
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,879
2009 to 2014 as we do in the tomato

714
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,880
graph each color is a different

715
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,200
asexually reproducing population or

716
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,200
clonal lineage so uh the bottom line

717
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,759
from this slide is that yes clonal

718
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,960
lineages change over time and yes we can

719
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:19,638
fairly rapidly identify them starting in

720
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,399
2011 we really had a boost in our

721
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:24,558
ability to understand what's going on

722
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:26,678
with vther INF Fest an because um a

723
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,119
large group of us about 28 Labs across

724
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,000
the country were in involved in a USDA

725
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,038
cap Grant and Bill Fry's portion of that

726
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,359
one of his uh projects as part of that

727
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:39,638
was that people from around the country

728
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,638
sent phyto infestans isolates to his lab

729
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:44,798
and he genotyped them using um micro

730
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,558
satellites he genotyped them within 24

731
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,558
hours and got that information back to

732
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,200
them now this was great for people

733
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,079
because they would know what colonal

734
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,840
lineage they were working with but it

735
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,158
was also great for us because suddenly

736
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,079
we had this huge collection of isolates

737
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,600
with which we could work

738
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:04,158
as part of the project um several labs

739
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,759
around the country Al also took that uh

740
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,240
isolate collection and tested them for

741
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:12,440
sensitivity to commonly used

742
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,558
fungicides so the resistant varieties

743
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,278
there there are resistant varieties

744
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,918
which the pathogen frequently can

745
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,720
overcome um actually breeders are

746
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,399
working especially in tomato on

747
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
increasing the number of resistant

748
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,918
varieties there's some really nice uh AR

749
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,440
je in tomato that being bred into lots

750
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,360
of different uh commercially available

751
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,720
varieties now which is great um but the

752
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,879
question that remained that we wanted to

753
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,759
look at was where does the pathogen arve

754
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
from every

755
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,879
year so Zack Hansen one of my graduate

756
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,119
students uh has been working on this

757
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,799
project and again we we wanted to use

758
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:56,038
some method to understand if we could

759
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:59,278
identify individuals within that asexual

760
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:02,720
clonal lineage so these would be be um

761
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,519
mutations that occurred over time

762
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,759
through mitosis right completely

763
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,278
asexually um and we wanted to know if we

764
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:15,599
could identify variation and if so could

765
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:18,398
we identify sublineages or or variants

766
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,558
that we could track across the

767
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,678
country uh and the reason we wanted to

768
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,599
do this is that we hope that it will

769
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,080
better enable us to understand how

770
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:29,759
epidemics start right so do they start

771
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:32,960
from some source of an oculum that's a

772
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:36,278
potato tuber in a home grower home

773
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,120
Gardener's you know backyard or are they

774
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,240
starting from transplants that get moved

775
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,119
by truck or potato tuber seed that gets

776
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,278
moved around the

777
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,918
country uh again this was part of our

778
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:52,079
cap Grant it was a huge Community effort

779
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,038
um we looked at we Zach looked at 257

780
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,278
isolates from four different clonal

781
00:33:54,038 --> 00:34:00,440
lineages clonal lineages are named uh

782
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:02,319
they started with us one they're named

783
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,880
by the country that you first identify

784
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,960
them in and then chronologically as new

785
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,240
lineages come along so us8 is the oldest

786
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,440
lineage that we looked at uh it first

787
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,118
appeared in the 1990s and we looked at

788
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,838
also US1 us23 and US

789
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,879
24 most of the isolates were from

790
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,320
between 2011 and 2014 because that was

791
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,639
the time period of the grant that we

792
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,919
were working on those were submitted to

793
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,679
Bill's lab he genotyped them say save

794
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,838
them away and those are the isolates

795
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,838
that we use for this particular

796
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:43,199
study so uh Zack was able

797
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:46,000
to uh use apk1 again identify Snips

798
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,598
within lineages and the first thing um

799
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,918
we wanted to do was look at uh the

800
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:54,079
genetic differences within a lineage so

801
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,879
our hypothesis would be that the oldest

802
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,280
lineage us8 would have the the most

803
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,760
diversity of isolates within that

804
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,720
lineage because it's been around the

805
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,000
longest um and when Zach went through

806
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,000
the culture collection uh we were able

807
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,239
to get by far the largest number of

808
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,719
isolates from the clonal lineage us23

809
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,919
the reason for that is for the last

810
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:18,319
three years that's almost the only

811
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,358
lineage that we've seen in North America

812
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,480
so anybody who sent in an isolate it's

813
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,279
going to be

814
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:28,199
us23 uh and he had between 20 and 30 of

815
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,880
the other three lineages um you can also

816
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,000
see here um after filtering the number

817
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,160
of snips that were identified and used

818
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,039
in these analyses and um the oldest

819
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,920
lineage did have um the highest level of

820
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:45,199
diversity um but even that was really

821
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,880
not it there's not a huge amount of

822
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,679
diversity as one might expect within a

823
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,240
clonal lineage but we did Identify some

824
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,279
diversity uh he did do an experiment

825
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:58,679
where he used the exact same isolate um

826
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,319
and uh performed GBS um seven different

827
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:05,239
times and um so that was sort of our

828
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:08,039
background control and this uh 043 was

829
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,679
the level of diversity sort of within

830
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,199
our control group so that was sort of

831
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,919
our background if it's not higher than

832
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,759
that um we know it's it's not worth

833
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,159
looking

834
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,720
at so Zach also did a principal

835
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:25,199
components analysis and on the entire um

836
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:28,078
group of 257 isolates and thankfully and

837
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,078
happily um we he was able to

838
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,160
uh differentiate the four clonal

839
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,318
lineages that we're working with it was

840
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,078
known prior to this study that the two

841
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:40,440
lineages us8 and US 24 were fairly

842
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,000
closely related so we knew that the the

843
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,679
system was working at least at some

844
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,599
level um what I'm going to show today is

845
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:54,480
actually um only the data from the US 23

846
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,079
clonal lineage because we had 166

847
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,000
isolates and and this really um gave us

848
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,079
the most interesting story with only 20

849
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,719
to 30 isolates we really did not have

850
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,640
enough data to to try to look at um

851
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:12,480
Regional differences compared to annual

852
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:14,358
differences but with the us23 isolates

853
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,559
um in this particular neighbor joining

854
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:21,039
tree um that they're categorized by

855
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:23,599
collection year and um you can't really

856
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,880
see very many yellow 2009 was the first

857
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:29,240
year that uh the colonal inage us23 was

858
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,000
identified we only had two isolates from

859
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,919
that inaugural year um three isolates

860
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,079
from 2010 you can see here that two of

861
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,760
the three isolates from 2010 clustered

862
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,440
together uh but then again because of

863
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,000
this Grant and people sending isolates

864
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,440
in in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 we had

865
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,318
many more isolates um so interestingly

866
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:57,159
uh in in uh 2011 and 2012 um the

867
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:59,239
isolates are fairly evenly dispersed

868
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,480
across Ross the neighbor joining tree or

869
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:05,919
up and down the neighbor joining tree um

870
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,838
but in 2013 and 2014 we could actually

871
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,440
see some grouping by year so these green

872
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:15,400
isolates here um in group a are 11

873
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,119
isolates all collected in 2014 uh and

874
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,079
they were collected from these states

875
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,079
Florida Massachusetts New York North

876
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:27,960
Carolina and Idaho so while phyto Fest

877
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,760
stands can fly a long way uh it it's

878
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,679
pretty unlikely that it w it would have

879
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,200
the ability to fly from Florida to Idaho

880
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,960
in the average season of the potato or

881
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:41,199
tomato crop so that was pretty

882
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,159
interesting to us um in group b we had

883
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:47,480
14 isolates collected from 2013 again um

884
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,480
with a fairly wide ranging group of

885
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,960
states uh when we tried to categorize

886
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,880
these by state or region we didn't come

887
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,720
up with any groupings but uh when we did

888
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,640
these categories by year we came up with

889
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,719
several groupings even in just 166

890
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:07,480
isolates one of the problems with this

891
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:09,959
study is that we don't have the same

892
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,838
number of isolates from every year for

893
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,280
sure so yes we need more data but I was

894
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,119
really excited about these initial data

895
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,000
that we

896
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,559
got so as I said we did not see any

897
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,400
evidence for Geographic sublineages so

898
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,599
if all of our inoculum was coming from

899
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,000
infected tubers or there's been a report

900
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,599
that tomato fruit uh the seed and tomato

901
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,358
fruit can can house uh phyo infest

902
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,920
stands over winter in Wisconsin so if

903
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:44,480
all of our inoculum were coming from

904
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,480
local sources we would expect to see

905
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,119
Regional Geographic sublineages

906
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,358
right if all of our inoculum if inoculum

907
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,400
were not coming from local sources but

908
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:02,199
were was rather being moved around on

909
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:04,160
seedlings or tubers or people um then

910
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,639
you might expect to see clustering by

911
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:10,759
year and that's what what we see So

912
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:13,159
based on these data um my current

913
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,960
hypothesis is that at least in some of

914
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:18,719
those cases the pathogen is moving long

915
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,639
long distances in a short period of time

916
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,239
probably in a truck um and and this is

917
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:26,400
what everyone has assumed that you know

918
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,078
the pathogen can move around but it's

919
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,760
really interesting to to have some data

920
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,800
to start to look at that and certainly

921
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,599
um you know some of these individual

922
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,240
lines here um when we get more data we

923
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,760
might see both Regional you know

924
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,039
sublineages as well as annual

925
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,560
sublineages because the most likely

926
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:51,759
scenario is that both Regional sources

927
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:54,920
and trucked sources are uh moving an

928
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,680
oculum around the country so in the last

929
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,400
so the last question this is perfect in

930
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:04,159
the last two minutes um the area that

931
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,200
we're going to be looking at next is

932
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,920
will the pathogen be able to overcome

933
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,879
host resistance and when anyone asks

934
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,880
this a PL pathologist is always going to

935
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,599
say of course the pathogen will be able

936
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,200
to overcome co host resistance history

937
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,800
165 years of History tells us that

938
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,439
certainly the pathogen will overcome

939
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,880
host resistance but can we get some data

940
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,559
to back that

941
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,000
up so one of the areas of Plant

942
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:34,480
Pathology that I have been watching from

943
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,079
the sideline is a really fascinating

944
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,400
area of studies on affectors it actually

945
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,760
has its own little term called eector

946
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,160
omics affectors are uh proteins that are

947
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,880
secreted by plant pathogens to help them

948
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,480
infect the plant and one of the

949
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,559
interesting things about infectors is

950
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,318
that R proteins from Plants will

951
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,679
recognize the affector and that's how

952
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:00,199
the r protein works so if we can get a

953
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,559
better idea of what effectors are

954
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:07,639
present in a pathogen population and you

955
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:10,480
guys have enough diversity in our genes

956
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:15,118
then we might be able to say hey this

957
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,280
field has this set of effectors mourich

958
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,920
what plant do we want to put there that

959
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,000
would be awesome that's like Precision

960
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,760
agriculture at the pathology breeding

961
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,800
level and and I absolutely believe that

962
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,920
this will be possible within the next 20

963
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,480
years

964
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,720
the reason I believe that is because of

965
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,880
my friends Paul Burch and Ingo Hine at

966
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,838
the James Hunton Institute and um they

967
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,599
came up with this technology that they

968
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:43,279
called in eector enrichment and

969
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,519
sequencing and I personally did not come

970
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,200
up with the with their name but it's

971
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,519
called eff and

972
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,318
seek and Paul said you always know if

973
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,199
the audience is listening when you say F

974
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:54,880
and

975
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,358
seek

976
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:02,160
um so eff and seek uh what they have

977
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:06,558
done is they have made uh biotinilated

978
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:09,920
RNA baits for a huge number of affectors

979
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:13,680
from both phyo infestans and phyto

980
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,720
capsy um they have from phyto capsy the

981
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:20,879
OM mys the most famous type of affector

982
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,879
is an fector that has a a protein Motif

983
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,039
amuno acid Motif called rxlr so they

984
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,838
have 509 rxlr effectors in cap capsy and

985
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,838
then in capsy there's also an

986
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:34,599
interesting group of affectors called

987
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,799
crinklers uh because when they

988
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,599
infiltrated them into neosan anamon it

989
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,318
crinkled the leaf um anyway uh so they

990
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,440
have 65 uh crinkler effectors and then

991
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:49,400
in infestans you can see um they have uh

992
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,280
a lot of uh infector baits for infestans

993
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,240
as well so they have these RNA baits

994
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,480
that are ready to go that have been

995
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,719
biotinated and the way it works you take

996
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,760
your genomic DNA from each of the isolet

997
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:05,919
of interest uh you uh cut it add a

998
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,800
adapter so that you'll be able to

999
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,280
amplify it in the end take your RNA bait

1000
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,559
hybridize them together the as I said

1001
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,880
the RNA bait is um coated

1002
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,319
in biotin then you take your stripped

1003
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,838
avidin coated magnetic beads put them

1004
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,920
together the strip avidin binds to the

1005
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:27,358
biotin you add a magnet because the

1006
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,480
magnetic bees will then come into the

1007
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:33,078
magnet you have your little pool of

1008
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,880
affectors you then um degrade the RNA

1009
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:39,680
away and you have after amplifying the

1010
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,400
entire affector set of every isolate

1011
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,799
that you can then sequence so they've

1012
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,079
done this on a small number of isolates

1013
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,119
and it's been effective they've done it

1014
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,079
on isolates that have genome sequences

1015
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,200
so they know the effector complement

1016
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,039
that's there what these guys don't have

1017
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,358
is a huge collection of isolates that

1018
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,719
you could then identify the affectors

1019
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,159
and go back and test them on host plants

1020
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:04,159
to see if that pathogen was then

1021
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,399
susceptible or resistant on that host

1022
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:11,440
plant so validation so that is our next

1023
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:15,119
step uh for both the phyto capsy and the

1024
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,679
phyto infestans um we plan to perform

1025
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,800
eff and seek uh with the folks at James

1026
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,358
Hunton um again as I said this will give

1027
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,200
us some functional testing of the uh Al

1028
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,400
and alic variants that they have

1029
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:32,279
identified to see um if a alic variant

1030
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,000
uh will actually enable enable to the pa

1031
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,480
the pathogen to get around the

1032
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,800
resistance of the plant the goal would

1033
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,719
then have this lead to a diagnostic

1034
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,119
where in fact you could go into a field

1035
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:48,358
fairly rapidly get 50 isolates determine

1036
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:50,358
what effectors they have and then figure

1037
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:52,598
out what would be the best plant to put

1038
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:56,199
in that field for capsy that would work

1039
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:58,838
because you have relatively few new

1040
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:01,318
individuals coming into a field for

1041
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,358
infest ANS um what would be really

1042
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,599
interesting is to understand the

1043
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:09,719
variability of affectors within those

1044
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:12,280
asexual clonal lineages you know so bill

1045
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:14,358
frb has some some evidence that there is

1046
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,400
some variability especially in the older

1047
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,639
lineages but it would be really

1048
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,358
fascinating to know what kind of

1049
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,719
variability there is that would help us

1050
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,799
manage the pathogen and also it would be

1051
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,639
interesting to see if the effector

1052
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,440
variability um corresponded in any way

1053
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,960
to the variability within lineage that

1054
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:36,079
we saw with the

1055
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:39,119
GBS so even though I hope you agree that

1056
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,359
even though uh two phyto species are

1057
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,119
very different uh my lab has been able

1058
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,679
to use similar strategies to understand

1059
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,960
the pathogen populations and by

1060
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,239
understanding these populations um we

1061
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,480
firmly believe that we will be able to

1062
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:56,919
improve disease management

1063
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,559
strategies acknowledgements uh this is

1064
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,240
my lab here on the right the phyto capsy

1065
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:03,559
work was done by a previous student

1066
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:07,318
Amara Dunn along with Marin Carlson the

1067
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:08,880
infestans work uh done by Zach Hansen

1068
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,239
and um Marin did a lot of the

1069
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,720
bioinformatics a whole list of

1070
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,679
collaborators we've been funded by uh

1071
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:18,558
for the capsy through the state of New

1072
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,598
York um Department of agen markets uh

1073
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,800
along with uh several different Grant

1074
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:24,240
panels from Nea a long list of

1075
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,960
collaborators that are also very

1076
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,239
important and with that I will answer

1077
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,240
there any

1078
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,838
questions ah

1079
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,720
yes yeah so the question is is there a

1080
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:41,400
possibility of hybridization between

1081
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:45,519
caps and infestans and um in some phyto

1082
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,519
species you can hybridize but not these

1083
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,679
two so the question is um do we know

1084
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,480
which are genes map with which or match

1085
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:58,399
with which effectors and in some cases

1086
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,199
yes and in some cases no um for for the

1087
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,160
defeated R genes uh we tend we tend to

1088
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,799
know what they are um for uh some

1089
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,318
actually in the for the r Gene that's

1090
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,240
most common in Pepper we do not know um

1091
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,000
the effector yet but there are a lot of

1092
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,318
folks working on that so I feel like by

1093
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,960
the time we were to a point where we

1094
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:22,119
could actually do some field based

1095
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,920
diagnostic that information would be

1096
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:27,079
available I should ask for questions

1097
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,079
from Geneva

1098
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,358
right so Larry's Larry's question is

1099
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,000
what's driving that change in uh

1100
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,078
population structure and infestans so

1101
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,119
there's really one dominant clonal

1102
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:44,318
lineage um and and the answer is that no

1103
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:47,559
one knows for sure but uh my hypothesis

1104
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:52,039
is that um that particular clonal

1105
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:55,798
lineage is is being dispersed widely it

1106
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:58,679
was widely found in several regions that

1107
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:02,239
um are both tomato transplant production

1108
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,759
and uh potato seed production and um so

1109
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,199
so I think it's just at the moment the

1110
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,920
lineage that's being most widely

1111
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:10,519
dispersed what we've seen um history

1112
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,519
would tell us that in the next two or

1113
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:14,199
three years we'll have a new clonal

1114
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,639
lineage that arrives probably from

1115
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:19,919
Mexico that is bigger and beefier and

1116
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:22,000
has less genetic bottlenecks and that

1117
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,838
will start to take over the over the

1118
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,599
world but it would be fantastic if that

1119
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,960
one same clonal lineage stayed around a

1120
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,280
bit longer because we actually know how

1121
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,639
to control it why do you say you think

1122
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,880
it would come up from Mexico oh right so

1123
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,358
why why would it come up from Mexico um

1124
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,039
so Mexico is the center of origin of

1125
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:41,679
phyo fans and it has a sexually

1126
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:43,719
reproducing population and we have a

1127
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,199
fairly significant trade with the

1128
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:49,358
country of Mexico so the most likely

1129
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:51,239
source of Entry would be Mexico um just

1130
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,798
because that's where the largest amount

1131
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:56,000
of diversity is um in other parts of the

1132
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:58,559
world the pathogen is predominantly

1133
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,159
clonal so if we get a new lineage from

1134
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,000
somewhere else in the world we would

1135
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,759
immediately know that because those

1136
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,199
lineages are already

1137
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,720
known in the

1138
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,039
back right so uh Matthew's question is

1139
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:13,959
the founding o spores last about three

1140
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,719
years based on the data that we've seen

1141
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,480
that in in bread o Sports last longer we

1142
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:23,199
don't actually know that um what we'll

1143
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:26,358
find that out um what we know right now

1144
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,399
is that that they're there my guess just

1145
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,719
I guess

1146
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,280
because what I've seen in Growers

1147
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:34,838
Fields the pathogen remains for a fairly

1148
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:38,200
long time um so that's probably why I

1149
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:41,358
said oh chances are they last longer but

1150
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:43,279
and and over time you'll get new new

1151
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,078
inbreds right I guess my thinking would

1152
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,680
be that any o Spore will live for three

1153
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,039
years but after you lose the founders

1154
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,199
like in Marin's little diagram you know

1155
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,239
the guys over here are always going to

1156
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:55,639
be inbreds um what we don't know is if

1157
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:58,759
we're going to see a reduction in

1158
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,279
pathogenicity due to inbreeding and we

1159
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,040
it's hard to tell that in a grower field

1160
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,000
because you never know if new inoculum

1161
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,358
has come in but we should be able to see

1162
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,358
that in our

1163
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,400
field right so how much genetic

1164
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,319
variation is there um within a clonal

1165
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,240
lineage or among between between the

1166
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:21,838
clonal lineages yeah that's supposed to

1167
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:26,118
be very

1168
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:28,880
right right so within lineage variation

1169
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:32,720
is more rare between than between

1170
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,680
lineage variation and the numbers for

1171
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:38,239
between lineage variation with our GBS

1172
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:41,719
data are known but I don't have them off

1173
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:44,039
the top of my head but there's much more

1174
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:46,679
variation between the lineages then

1175
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:50,039
within the lineage so it it is true that

1176
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,558
this is the first time that um we've

1177
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:56,159
really been able to look at variation

1178
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,480
within a clonal lineage um with uh micro

1179
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,279
satellite

1180
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,798
um a lineage you know all of the 166

1181
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:07,119
isolates were not identical but about

1182
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:10,920
150 of them had the exact same SSR

1183
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,640
genotype with 12 microsatellite Loi um

1184
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,200
there were some variants um and so a

1185
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:18,639
variant individual I think there were

1186
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:22,118
maybe 10 to 15 variants would have a new

1187
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,358
alil at one of the 12 Losi

1188
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:26,519
interestingly when we looked at those

1189
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:30,679
variants in the location in the neighbor

1190
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:33,559
were joining tree the GBS data was

1191
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:36,118
unrelated to whether or not there was a

1192
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:36,119
SSR

1193
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,599
variant that's what we know okay if

1194
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,599
there no further questions thanks
