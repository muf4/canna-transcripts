1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,480
it's pruning season and i wanted to show

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,519
you what the vine looks like before we

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,679
prune during prune and after pruning

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,960
so this is a pretty standard grapevine

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,399
here for the finger lids we're in a

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
riesling block

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,320
this is called a double geo or a two

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,198
tier flat bow system

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,238
so this was a cane pruned vine uh last

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
season

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,119
and so here's our first cane that comes

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
out this is another cane

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,718
came here

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,799
and then a cane here too

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
and from our canes we grew the shoots

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,839
right here these are some nice shoots

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,640
uh and on the shoots are buds

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,480
and so basically our fruiting zone

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,120
was right through here

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,000
so our our buds would have gone leaf

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,079
leaf

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
and then cluster cluster and you can see

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,799
where some clusters came off here

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,118
and then it would go up from there so up

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,200
above here this was all leaf area

28
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,200
our fruit was in here hidden in some

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
leaves

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,320
so now what we need to do

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,478
is prune these so that we are laying out

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,199
some canes again for this year

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:22,000
so i'm going to move up the row here

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
i prepared a vine and cut out a little

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
bit of the stuff around it so that you

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,520
can better see what we're doing

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
so here's a vine that i'm preparing for

38
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,438
pruning

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,118
so what we want to do is get rid of

40
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,000
these old canes

41
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,719
and we need to lay down new canes so

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,118
that they'll produce shoots this year

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,519
so we're going to look at what we have

44
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,640
that's going to be decent for laying

45
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,319
down

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,320
and in this case

47
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,039
this wood is quite poor i just snapped

48
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,879
it as i was bringing it around the wire

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,960
but it has a gray wood that's up here

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,759
and so that means that the cane is

51
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,078
basically dead or is in very poor shape

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,478
so this is not going to work to be a

53
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,878
cane to lay down there because none of

54
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,639
that is going to grow that's all gray

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,239
when you cut through there

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,318
so that's not going to work for me to

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,000
lay it down

58
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,359
so we're looking for something to lay

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,680
down here

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,680
i don't particularly want to use this

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
one for two reasons

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
one is that it's very thick in diameter

63
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
this is what we call bull wood

64
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,799
and we want something that's a little

65
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,639
more narrow

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
like this

67
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
uh the second reason is that this is

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
quite far out from this region that we

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,598
call the head of the vine

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,319
and if we use this one then we'll have

71
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,719
no fruit production along this area

72
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,479
so that's not great either so basically

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,120
there's nothing on this cane that i can

74
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,318
use so i'm going to cut it out we don't

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
need any of this down here

76
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,919
so i'm just going to get rid of some of

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
this

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
clean it up and get it out of here

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,479
and get rid of the rest of this cane too

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,439
you can see it actually entwines into

81
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,439
the neighboring vine

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
so

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
that's gone

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,158
and what we're gonna have to do is find

85
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,079
something else to lay down in its place

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,759
and in this case this

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
might be

88
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,639
a pretty decent choice

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,158
it's got some nice periderm as we would

90
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,479
say this nice brown wood along here and

91
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,679
would probably tie out reasonably well

92
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,119
here

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
it gets a little gray at the end but uh

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
it might be our best choice i think for

95
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,959
what's going to go along here

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
so for now

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,000
i'm gonna go like this

98
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,280
and get rid of this gray stuff at the

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,598
end

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,199
so that's one cane

101
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,359
now we need to lay out another cane

102
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,719
along this fruiting wire

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,799
this one looks not too bad uh

104
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,199
a little speckled

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
a little thicker than i would like

106
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,199
but we don't really have any good

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,799
options left here

108
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,798
so i'm gonna get rid of this

109
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,679
cut off this old cane

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,279
it's just easier to

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
get these out of the way by cutting

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,239
and that one's gone

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,439
and i think the plan is going to be to

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,439
lay this one down

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
got to get it through our catch wires

116
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,280
here

117
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,599
got a clip on our wires

118
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,319
so this one's clearly a little long it

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
goes into the next vine so i'm going to

120
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,199
snip that off there

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,439
so that will go down along that wire

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,840
this one

123
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,839
along here

124
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,159
so moving to the other side of the vine

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,520
we're looking for some killings to lay

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,520
down we've cut this one off already

127
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,519
we've got some nice uh gray wood here

128
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,239
that we know is not going to produce uh

129
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,279
very good buds or shoots it's actually

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
got some

131
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,519
spots from phomopsis

132
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:28,079
right along the cane here and so that is

133
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,079
probably why the cane is mostly dead

134
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,478
so in this case we're looking for two

135
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,879
canes that are close to the head of the

136
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,879
vine that we can lay down on these

137
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,680
fruiting wires

138
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,439
so let's see this one does not look too

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
bad

140
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,439
that one is gray at the top so that's

141
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,360
not going to be very good

142
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,240
and then this one gets out a little bit

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
far

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
so in this case i think this is probably

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,360
my best shot

146
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,359
i'll get this out of here

147
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,680
and so then i'll lay this one down along

148
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,240
here

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,918
now we need a cane for on the other side

150
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,918
uh neither of these is perfect again

151
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,159
that this one gets more gray towards the

152
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,560
top but this one is a little bit bigger

153
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
with longer internodes

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
so hard to decide exactly what to use

155
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,839
here i think i'd probably go for this

156
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,199
one

157
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,439
so in this case i'm going to cut this

158
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,439
off

159
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,240
get rid of all this

160
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,759
clean up this mess you can see this is

161
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,759
all dead wood it's had famous on it

162
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,638
this comes from the neighboring vine so

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,639
i'm gonna just cut this out of the way

164
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,639
here

165
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
and this here

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,918
is actually a really really long shoot

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,720
so we've left this one as a potential

168
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,879
trunk renewal so often our trunks will

169
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
get damaged from the cold

170
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
in the finger lakes region we normally

171
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,038
leave a couple of trunks so that we have

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,560
a backup if one gets damaged we've still

173
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,478
got another one

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,959
we've left this here in case we want to

175
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,598
replace one of the trunks in this case

176
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,879
it's not necessary there's no visible

177
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,478
damage here

178
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,240
having said that when there's cold

179
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,560
damage on the trunk it can often show up

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
a couple of years later

181
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
but this is actually this huge shoot

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
that comes up and across here so i'm

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,079
going to get rid of this whole thing

184
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,840
cut it out of the way i'm going to leave

185
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,000
a bud down here though

186
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,560
so that we can use this as a potential

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,279
renewal again so the butt at the bottom

188
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
here will grow into another shoot that

189
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,478
will grow up and then if we want to

190
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,478
replace a trunk next year

191
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,079
we'll have that

192
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,279
so let me cut this out and i'll show you

193
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,279
what this is going to look like

194
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,680
so i'm going to cut off the top of this

195
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,439
because it's longer than we need

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
so this is going to be our cane for this

197
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,759
side

198
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
and then this one again is longer than

199
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,199
we need

200
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,198
and it's really big here at the top

201
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
but this is going to be our cane that

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
wraps along this fruiting wire

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
right here

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,120
so this is a cane pruned vine now so

205
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
we've got our four canes one two three

206
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,639
four

207
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,799
and each of these has a series of nodes

208
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,600
on them right here and each node is a

209
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,359
bud

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
and these buds are going to grow into

211
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,039
shoots and those shoots are going to

212
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
produce group grapes this growing season

213
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,080
this has been a production of cornell

214
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,080
university on the web at cornell.edu
