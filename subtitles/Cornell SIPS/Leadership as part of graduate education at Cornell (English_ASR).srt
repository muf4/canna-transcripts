1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,280
University

3
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,179
last semester so I'm going to introduce

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,800
them

5
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,420
um most of us probably already know

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,219
Marvin since he's been our department

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,980
chair since 2000

8
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,018
but um you didn't always start out oh

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,020
and his research interests include

10
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,960
stable fairy Crop Production but even

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,359
though we start out doing Horticulture

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,219
um you first got his fastest Bachelors

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,320
from Bucknell University

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,660
um in biology and then

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,878
um his master's from University of South

16
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,558
Carolina also in biology then finally

17
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,799
when he went to Michigan State

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,699
University for his PhD he switched

19
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,359
Horticulture

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,219
um

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,839
those of you who know a little bit

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,179
better probably know that he's a man of

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,840
many interests and

24
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:06,420
um when he loves to play his own and

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,079
travel and play volleyball is a really

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,879
great Supply at his house I think if you

27
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,079
want to dress as an alligator she might

28
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,079
show us a picture later

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,938
um and then if you take his leadership

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,699
course to find out even more about him

31
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,879
for example that is Myers-Briggs

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,400
personality type is intj which means

33
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,079
introverted intuitive thinking and

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
judging

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,319
um and the reason you got interested in

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,579
this leadership course is he realized

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,258
there was a difference between what

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,700
Colonel said it was going to do that it

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,618
was going to prepare its graduate

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,478
students to be leaders in the kids in

41
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,159
their communities and what it actually

42
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,340
offered graduate students in terms of

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,560
learning how to become leaders so he

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,659
decided to organize his class and he

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,340
called it the big guns so that's where

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,359
the pan function

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,000
um Pam is a uh the president of the

48
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,399
cosmos Hill Associates and also a senior

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,259
human resource consultant and

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,478
organizational development here at

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,099
Cornell

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,920
she got her bachelor's from Harvard

53
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,840
University and then her master's at the

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,699
New York State School in industrial and

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,479
Labor Relations

56
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,219
um

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,000
he's a really experienced Human

58
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:20,340
Resources consultant

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,598
who's worked with a variety of private

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,219
and private businesses and institutions

61
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,859
that have range from local businesses

62
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,080
like moose food restaurants

63
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,599
to huge corporations such as Johnson and

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,860
Johnson and Nestle chocolate Corporation

65
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:41,518
and Rubbermaid and then also to Federal

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,819
programs such as U.S IRS and the

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,039
department of the army so two really

68
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:51,139
impressive resumes and now I'm going to

69
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,139
I'd like Margaret panties

70
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,860
it's a real pleasure to be here today

71
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,859
and talk to you about leadership the

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,420
Quran I want to make the case that I

73
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,760
think we need more opportunities for

74
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,159
leadership development particularly

75
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,719
amongst our graduate students and the

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,658
second case is sometimes what we think

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,519
is leadership sometimes isn't really it

78
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,060
doesn't really mean

79
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,060
so

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm going to start off with an uplifting

81
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,738
article it came out this summer the

82
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,759
Republicans are most widely read article

83
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,860
ever send your kids

84
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,419
and turn your kids into zombies There's

85
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,000
a large critique about ivy league

86
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,859
education but the one piece of relevance

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm going to pull out there is this

88
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
particular few serious one idea of a

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,940
ball is communicated it was a speaker

90
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,939
supposed leadership Harvard Wisconsin

91
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,939
today

92
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:57,000
what these institutions mean is

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,039
leadership is simply getting to the top

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,658
and it doesn't occur to people in charge

95
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,620
of elite colleges and the concept of

96
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:03,359
leadership

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,980
ought to have a higher meeting or really

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,500
many

99
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,539
so that's a pretty skating critique of

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,680
what we teach at the United school and

101
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,179
if you want more critique you can go

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,739
ahead and read the article

103
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,299
but

104
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,459
one of the things I thought we could

105
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,060
start off doing is think about what it

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,139
means to be successful now people

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,478
sometimes shy away from the term

108
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,519
leadership because I don't want to ever

109
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,159
be a leader most people want to be

110
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,719
successful and most people who end up in

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,060
leadership positions were judged to be

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
successful at some point in their mind

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,500
and people have written a lot about what

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
it takes to be successful

115
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,399
and so what we're going to do is to

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,560
spend a few minutes get any groups and I

117
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,539
want you to come up with a list of some

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,040
things that you think characterize

119
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,199
successful people and then we'll compare

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,600
your list with what people who study

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,460
these things

122
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,259
okay let's take a few minutes you can

123
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,099
stop select just get into groups and

124
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,939
just someone described a necklace like

125
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,939
characterizing successful movies

126
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,060
I can see by the level of conversation

127
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,939
that you all have

128
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,899
an abundance of ideas so we want to hear

129
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,360
from you

130
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,779
let's start in the back with the rump

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,780
caucus

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,020
um enthusiasm organization satisfaction

133
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,638
with life path resilience make the most

134
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,560
of interpersonal relationships

135
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,160
passionate about what you do but not

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,740
insanely passionate

137
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,800
able to focus translate share

138
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,478
um humble humility acknowledge one

139
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,759
shortcomings and be okay with that

140
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,758
ability to listen to other perspectives

141
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:57,740

so many times yet for Mastery of a given

172
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,098
skill set vision and poor thought being

173
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,319
able to specific problems and another

174
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,360
thought was success depends on how you

175
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,000
define it

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,139
well our group came up with empathy

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,339
missionary hard-working inclusive

178
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:45,960
capable of decisions is enthusiastic

179
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:49,799
communication skills within the group

180
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,000
can also outside and heifer and I

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,020
realized we missed the most important

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,019
one which is humor yeah

183
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,598
decisive and then delegating well

184
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,759
do you have anything on your list

185
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,620
um yeah yeah you covered a lot of it we

186
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,259
put a self-evaluation the ability to

187
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,660
give and accept criticism uh and

188
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,360
attention to detail for the on the

189
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:28,020
Baylor game okay great that was a

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,400
wonderful list yeah yeah so you know

191
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,338
people write books on how to be

192
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,458
successful so I try to do is go through

193
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,440
those and bleed out the top

194
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,538
characteristics they say are try to be

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,360
successful and I think a lot of people

196
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:44,218
also have all these in one form or

197
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,360
another on the list of her vision and

198
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,980
vision enthusiasm working hard

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,300
no one said management conflict that's

200
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,100
an important point

201
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,219
be accessible so a lot of these others

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,379
are communication and so forth

203
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,778
but you know I didn't hear anybody

204
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:04,639
mention the thing that we spent almost

205
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,639
95 of our time doing

206
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,958
which is having specific knowledge of

207
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,159
skill we spend a lot of our time

208
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,579
teaching people how to do things

209
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,719
having uh

210
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,639
okay so I've missed that so the master

211
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,259
is sort of skill set

212
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,360
the point I want to make though is we

213
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,179
spend most of our time teaching and

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,740
working on that piece of it at the and

215
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,759
these kind of I don't really ignore

216
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,680
these others but we don't really

217
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,539
deliberately focus on that and try to

218
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,939
build expertise in some of these other

219
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,559
things but a lot easier innate they kind

220
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,600
of come naturally people but others can

221
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,539
be improved upon in the middle of time

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,700
and that's why I think that we need to

223
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:51,419
offer opportunities for our students to

224
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,700
build those skill sets now part of the

225
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,639
bottom I think we have in our community

226
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,320
is this thing called science

227
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,480
fundamentalism this is the definition

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,700
that you know the only thing that's

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,620
important is science if you don't do a

230
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,759
science there's nothing else really

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,459
matters

232
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,679
and I think sometimes you know feel that

233
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,539
a lot or at least fear that sunlight so

234
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,159
the question when I ask is there a place

235
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,259
that research one University is like

236
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,240
Cornell we're developing skill sets in

237
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,639
addition to Scientific confidence

238
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,339
if so the answer is yes you all listed

239
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,559
all these things that are key to success

240
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,540
can we make room for developing these

241
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,299
skill sets in our students

242
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:34,559
and do we model those ourselves as

243
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:37,139
faculty how do we teach those skills

244
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,379
so those are the questions that um

245
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,600
I want to Grapple with today and if you

246
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,159
look across the University

247
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,659
there are lots of opportunities for

248
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,179
leadership programs throughout your

249
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,219
students and you know Pam happy with

250
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,319
this because she's travels in those

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,639
circles quite a bit and we listed all

252
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,220
these up here

253
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,220
well what's missing that list

254
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,980
there is no real program directed for

255
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,679
scientists

256
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,700
you know that even the engineers figured

257
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,699
out this is important

258
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,159
so as Maria mentioned the introduction

259
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,439
that was a Genesis for a tribal at least

260
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,659
something at least the chorus providers

261
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,079
to help teach some of these efficient

262
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,078
skills

263
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:31,259
now the course generally has 20 to 25

264
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,139
students in it how many graduate

265
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,838
students are there in college

266
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:39,838
on hundreds hundreds hundreds and the

267
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,399
number one reason we hear why people my

268
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
students don't take that class because

269
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,659
my major advice would that will only be

270
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,659
spending time outside the lab recently

271
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,120
classes they consider it well not

272
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:53,578
important and yet all of you just

273
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,839
collectively identified all these trades

274
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,159
that make people successful to make

275
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,920
people good leaders

276
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,319
yeah those are the run in the market

277
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,939
positions don't want our students

278
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,140
doing these other things because they

279
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,940
should be in the lab of working on

280
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,699
design so I think that's a real problem

281
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,440
with our culture here at Cornell

282
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,399
can we claim to develop leaders when we

283
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,019
don't provide our students with

284
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,200
opportunities to develop skills for

285
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,799
Success other than confidence in science

286
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,839
well I don't know if you can but we do

287
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,759
we have lost leadership abilities civic

288
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,500
responsibility and curiosity assessment

289
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,500
of the front page of this house

290
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,120
then there are lots of courses at

291
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,820
Cornell that

292
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,459
uh sort of get out in leadership in one

293
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,320
aspect or another this is a course

294
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,078
inspiring leadership

295
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,060
and the goal of this is to expose you to

296
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,859
the habits practices skills and mindset

297
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,899
common twists during our leaders through

298
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,000
discussions meetings exercises films and

299
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,159
guest videos

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,059
it sounds to me like a class where you

301
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,919
go and sit

302
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,379
and typical things happen but I'm not

303
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:05,219
sure whether it actually engages you in

304
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:09,179
a significant leadership experience

305
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,259
Hotel offers a program where they expose

306
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,059
you to meaningful leadership

307
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,939
opportunities by interacting with

308
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,099
hospitality leaders so put students in

309
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,820
the room the people that are leaders and

310
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,320
somehow

311
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,180
okay now I'm saying this is that this is

312
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
a good thing to do but I'm not sure if

313
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,620
it's really comprehensive in this

314
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,179
approach the vets do you know they have

315
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,459
something too leadership program here

316
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,539
it's an intensive research oriented

317
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,219
initiative

318
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,838
but again I would argue that yeah

319
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,399
there's nothing wrong with that but I'm

320
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,800
not really sure what that really teaches

321
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,639
leadership in the sense that we should

322
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,639
be teaching this because

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,559
so I think too often our approach to

324
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,740
leadership training even when we said

325
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,819
we're going to do it is on the plasmosis

326
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,200
put people in the room with leaders and

327
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,379
they'll somehow become leaders and stuff

328
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,120
and often doesn't work out and we also

329
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,559
don't address the day-to-day issues that

330
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,379
must be dealt with quite good leaders

331
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,259
it's fine had a vision and all that but

332
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,419
you know it's the implementation that it

333
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,519
doesn't make or break and oftentimes the

334
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,379
devil's in those details and you can't

335
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,578
just be a big picture person in ignore

336
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,179
the details you've got to kind of work

337
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:20,179
in both levels

338
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,359
a lot of Business Schools you know

339
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,159
that's kind of a forte if you look at

340
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,778
almost every mission statement a very

341
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,059
business school in the country it's

342
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,399
going to say you know we developed the

343
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,719
leaders for the future and the CEOs and

344
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,278
Business Leaders and so forth and this

345
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,019
is one I just pulled out of Chicago

346
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,419
School business

347
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,220
it's 1898 we produced ideas and leaders

348
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,479
that shape the world of business our

349
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,100
rigorous system and based approach

350
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
business education transform our

351
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,220
students into competent effective

352
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,680
respective Business Leaders compared to

353
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,259
face upon this challenge that's a great

354
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,919
mission statement and you know I I hope

355
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:58,500
they do that another article that came

356
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,958
out this summer was five MBA programs

357
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,419
non-produced leaders and it was a

358
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,539
critique of the Chicago business up 100

359
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,159
programs like that but today we produce

360
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,860
leaders but they really kind of miss a

361
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,500
mark and these are the critiques that

362
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,720
Drew Hansen made of course Magazine

363
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,120
first of all he said that leaders

364
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,339
understand people mbas and then again

365
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,320
oil everything down to numbers

366
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,120
you want to try to lead despite looking

367
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,800
at the numbers and metrics and so forth

368
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,320
like that you're never going to succeed

369
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,958
because behind those numbers and metrics

370
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,879
are people they have Ambitions and

371
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,159
passions and feelings and sensitivities

372
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,458
if you ignore that you know you ignored

373
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,198
your own curl and the Jews has a few

374
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:42,359
skills compatible with the rest of the

375
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,578
curriculum and they've got lost in that

376
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,899
all the hard analysis of technicals so

377
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,399
that's one critique mix of the

378
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,980
businesses

379
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,139
big three the second one is the leaders

380
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,339
see the big picture the NBA's

381
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,100
unfortunately you learn about business

382
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,360
in the street Parks I know I've never

383
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,740
went to business school I don't know

384
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,079
whether that's right now

385
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,399
about a critique or not but he says it

386
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,138
is that you learn about things in the

387
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,759
position but you don't really step back

388
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,500
and look at how everything's connected

389
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,559
how one thing connects with another

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,600
connects to another and they tend to put

391
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,578
things in silence and this but this

392
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,980
isn't

393
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,919
and then the third critique he makes uh

394
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,839
Business Schools leadership is that

395
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,539
strategic plan is essential we don't

396
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,060
have to do it but executing the plan is

397
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,578
what sets good companies apart from that

398
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,619
and schools teach strategic planning

399
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:33,479
where they fail to teach how to execute

400
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,278
because they do not understand how to

401
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,959
bring people together to work in teams

402
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,120
to get things done

403
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,859
it's one thing the Strategic plan here's

404
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,500
what we're going to do but then how do

405
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,060
you implement that and make it happen do

406
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,860
that you've got to understand people on

407
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,958
how to build teams and how to carry

408
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,940
things out and a lot of times people

409
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,778
that are leadership positions fail to

410
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,279
pay attention to the details and so

411
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:58,278
it failed the contacts

412
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,399
Harvard Business review of Marcus

413
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,899
Buckingham says those who taught on the

414
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,759
field of leadership development the

415
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,859
model Works something like this we can

416
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,959
be the top performers pick your brains

417
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:14,279
with the best techniques codify those

418
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,380
techniques into a formula and we have

419
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,818
best practice so once we discover it

420
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,559
turn into formula it's just a matter of

421
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,119
bringing you in line to perform this is

422
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,259
what works you do it you'll be

423
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,698
successful too

424
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,500
but he was honestly it could it be

425
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,179
otherwise your leadership development

426
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,099
instead of being tailored to individuals

427
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,780
the answer is yes

428
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,219
it's feasible to build a system that

429
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,019
delivers perfectly different training

430
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,019
context to different types of leaders

431
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,080
so having said all that sort of

432
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,798
background

433
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,379
what I felt years several years ago was

434
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,900
needed was a course about leadership

435
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,419
skills for emerging scientists build

436
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,860
confidence and people skills it will be

437
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,840
an important component of success after

438
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,459
graduation

439
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,500
also of course it doesn't teach

440
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,819
leadership through osmosis don't put

441
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,579
people in room leaders and hope that it

442
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:04,019
rubs off by doing and experiencing

443
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,418
the course it recognizes that

444
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,740
individuals have different strengths

445
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,480
and that there are different types of

446
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,538
leadership needed for different types of

447
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,860
situations and understand suspect

448
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,839
academic leadership may look different

449
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,399
than successful leadership and other

450
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,259
sorts of organizations

451
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,419
I mean that's why we probably don't take

452
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,000
you know a four-star in general and

453
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,380
bring them in to run Cornell you know

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
there's a type of leadership that works

455
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,679
really well

456
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,359
here so there's different sizes

457
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,579
understand that this isn't one size fits

458
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,079
all additional model and I understand it

459
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,579
there's different types of leadership

460
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,460
stuff different types of organizations

461
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:45,359
so that's what we're about in our course

462
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,579
in LS 5100 our philosophy is we learn by

463
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,740
doing you don't learn by listening you

464
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:53,819
learn by doing and engaging in

465
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,759
activities that serve you

466
00:18:53,819 --> 00:19:00,139
you know condition your brain to fuel

467
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,140
and experience my life

468
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,038
the course is individualized people are

469
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,959
very different than Maria her

470
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,119
introduction

471
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,579
told you my Myers-Briggs Timberland

472
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,939
index type I'm Poinsett Valley is the

473
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,379
same as pans and you covered five to

474
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,419
this I think that way a lot of you in

475
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,640
the room are probably the same way but

476
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,080
it's important to realize the way you

477
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,759
are and the way you see things because

478
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,178
there's only one percent of the

479
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,700
population that are like us like some of

480
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,440
you one percent and there are other

481
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,720
types of 10 percent of the population

482
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,160
that way so it makes a real difference

483
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,558
whenever we're working with other people

484
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,759
understand why we by the way we are my

485
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,918
other people

486
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:44,038
that's why I mean by individual lives

487
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,960
and then contextual a lot of the I just

488
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,279
sort of mentioned that leadership in my

489
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,860
contacts whether you

490
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,500
know we didn't military or medium

491
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,839
University or the department or section

492
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,058
is very different depending on what the

493
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,418
context is and the type of relationships

494
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:02,399
and decision making you have if they do

495
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,720
and it's intensely personal

496
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
the

497
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,740
stories and things that are shared to

498
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,419
really be meaningful they don't come out

499
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,099
of the textbook they come from

500
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,679
Individual sharing very personal

501
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,939
experiences with each other and how they

502
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,160
felt how they reacted in those

503
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,480
situations we were taking you know what

504
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,279
they could have done differently what

505
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,798
went well but didn't know what else was

506
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,480
very personal and so a lot of the

507
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,259
conversations have happened in that

508
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,779
class

509
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,700
stay within that classroom the reason

510
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,178
what she learned about me in class I

511
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,179
like Grace

512
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,798
so our course has a syllabus it's 10

513
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,319
weeks long it starts in the winter

514
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,519
semester It Ends by spring break and we

515
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,740
do these 10 different things so I'm

516
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,900
going to show up and talk about what

517
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,740
we're going to talk about the others the

518
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,179
first week we talk about about

519
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,579
leadership is and what doesn't mean to

520
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,798
be a leader so what of the activity that

521
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:58,439
you engaged in here

522
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:00,359
we would have time we always kind of

523
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,400
like put a little twist in things what

524
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,558
we might have done is pick the group

525
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,259
leaders ahead of time and told one of

526
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,819
the group leaders I want you to be very

527
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,160
opinionated and obviously what anybody

528
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,720
else says

529
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,419
it used to be that way another person

530
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,779
would be really bushy and not have any

531
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,980
opinion and the third person might say

532
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,240
oh you don't want to say anything the

533
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,360
Mind offend the administration so let's

534
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,339
not say that so while you're engaged in

535
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,359
this exercise these people behaving in a

536
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:30,418
certain way and you're forming as

537
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,939
opinion about them oh man all right

538
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,520
and then when you talk about and resolve

539
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,440
you can you get the information but you

540
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,058
also think how did you think about how

541
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,179
science and Power in that as a leader

542
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:43,619
and he said wow how did you feel about

543
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,298
that when the person went to a charge

544
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,918
listen to you and said what it kind of

545
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:50,279
brings that out so those are the sorts

546
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,259
of things we do in this class

547
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,619
uh we talked already a little bit about

548
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:56,759
personal style on leadership using the

549
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:58,619
Myers-Briggs temperament Index this is

550
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,319
originally developed during World War II

551
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,399
when all men went off to war and there

552
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,558
were all these jobs that needed to be

553
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,960
done here in the United States you know

554
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,538
people have to do them were women most

555
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,579
of the women hadn't received any kind of

556
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,200
training they were Housewives and now

557
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,939
there was opportunities to do work and

558
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,798
they were needed to do work by the

559
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,179
country but you didn't just want to pick

560
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,319
somebody up and say oh you're going to

561
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,240
work in the steel mill and you're going

562
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,619
to work in the the library and you're

563
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,460
going to do this and that

564
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,678
so a baseball program doesn't work

565
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,240
they developed this personality

566
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,880
tournament and actually take this test

567
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,339
and it can tell you what career what

568
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
sort of types of work really fit your

569
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,899
personality well I don't think

570
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,400
successful hardly successful and it's

571
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,280
still used to this day

572
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,280
more than a thousand PhD uses written on

573
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:51,000
the BIOS events how many people here

574
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:54,798
have done Myers Briggs oh okay so

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,798
probably about whoever happened

576
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,500
so we do that with the students

577
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,259
and we talk about the whole

578
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,119
education to that we also do something

579
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,158
called strength binders this is a

580
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,798
another

581
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,320
way to understand yourself that was

582
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,679
developed by Gallup and those folks that

583
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:19,980
identified 34 strains that people have

584
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,059
and with for you you answered a bunch of

585
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,700
questions to support that identifies

586
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,500
your top five strengths so you know what

587
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,640
you're good at you can play your

588
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,460
strength I mean the big part of

589
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,600
leadership is understanding this stuff

590
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,640
that's the first step understand

591
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,959
yourself know where you're strong where

592
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,340
you're weak so you can kind of

593
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,019
compensate for those weaknesses and go

594
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,079
understand so we do that for the first

595
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:41,700
three weeks and then the last thing we

596
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,319
do on the part about understanding

597
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,179
yourself is how do you present yourself

598
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,980
to the outside world

599
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,798
now we know one of the first things that

600
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,860
happens when you apply for a job

601
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,960
is that the employer potential Reporter

602
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,939
Goes on Facebook to see what kind of

603
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,798
person you are and that is definitely

604
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,000
the case there are people here in the

605
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,158
admissions office that's what they do

606
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,079
you have people who go on Facebook a

607
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,520
prospective students and then judgments

608
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,279
based on that

609
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,720
now one of the things about Facebook if

610
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,759
you hang out with some shooting

611
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,179
characters like I do you don't have any

612
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,940
control over what they post on Facebook

613
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:20,220
so I'm one if you have the folks looking

614
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,080
about me something I want to give it to

615
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,759
them so they don't like search around I

616
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,178
want to print up something really easy

617
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,679
so they can understand who I am and one

618
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,120
of the things that we do in the class is

619
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,340
we ask the students to develop the

620
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,678
electronic portfolios sort of captures

621
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,538
what they're about so they can send a

622
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,519
link to their electronic portfolio as a

623
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:39,900
potential employer so they can look at

624
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,700
their portfolio and learn about them

625
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,980
that way instead of like fishing around

626
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,440
with all those dark corners and trying

627
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,538
to find out what's out there so I'm

628
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,159
gonna

629
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:53,058
show you

630
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,059
careers

631
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,220
so much for what happens

632
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,019
basically they're attacked across the

633
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,460
potty and each of the tabs

634
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,558
says something about you and a lot more

635
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,079
detail in the resume anyway so I've

636
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,879
heard Maria she has a little bit here on

637
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,460
her research project and including some

638
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,380
pictures and

639
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,360
linked to her resume or poster that she

640
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,860
did it's really nice to be able to do

641
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,839
that

642
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,099
class she did some reflexes on

643
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,740
leadership but when it needs to be a

644
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:30,480
leader did an essay on Rachel Carlson

645
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,099
and what that how that influenced her

646
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,679
personally and so you can put all that

647
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:38,178
on your electronic portfolio your

648
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,179
teaching and learning experiences

649
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:43,859
Peace Corps and so forth and a little

650
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,679
bit about her own interests and things

651
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:50,298
that you might not know about in reality

652
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,298
swim teams you're going to Marathon and

653
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,079
employees are so just those little tabs

654
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,580
that I tell you a whole lot I think

655
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,019
about Maria that you wouldn't have

656
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,519
gotten from a resume

657
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,058
and so we want our students to do that

658
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,058
with that

659
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:08,460
I I did one for myself

660
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:10,740
because I think it's great to put up a

661
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,880
page about me a little bit about my

662
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,980
research

663
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,559
pictures and so forth

664
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,720
teaching experiences

665
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:22,379
some links to other websites

666
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,740
my own reflexes on leadership

667
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,860
transformative experiences

668
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,319
a lot to me and then okay since you said

669
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,819
my special talents and skill sets some

670
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,700
of the work I do in Guatemala I put

671
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,019
there some of the trips I've done I

672
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,500
think down here is my alligator

673
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:39,500
wrestling

674
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:47,099
so they're really great there's

675
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:48,778
electronic portfolios so we have

676
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:51,178
students do that so then after that

677
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:52,440
fourth week they you know learn about

678
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,580
themselves and they put that out there

679
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,798
for the world

680
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:59,099
that from there on

681
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,079
we go into some other things

682
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,058
so

683
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,439
people in this class generally aren't

684
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,240
from all over the world

685
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,340
and they're going to go back out to

686
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,400
organization that are full of them or

687
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,720
touch clients or

688
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,538
parts of the world that are different

689
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,579
than internet so we spend a lot of time

690
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,379
talking about cultural fluency it's part

691
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:22,439
of the context for you if you do

692
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,440
leadership basically textual and it's

693
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,840
important to understand the Norms of

694
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,759
different cultures before you insert

695
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:33,599
yourself into the culture you're using

696
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:36,379
Western norms and fail literally

697
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,359
so that's a lot of the news in the next

698
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,278
experiential work with that people share

699
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,639
stories about things that have been

700
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,798
particularly interesting or jarring in

701
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,919
other cultures even if

702
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,819
this culture and experiencing odd things

703
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,759
here

704
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,259
it's usually very funny and very

705
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,359
interesting and stimulates more

706
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,778
conversation about how it is to work in

707
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,759
a different and diverse workplace than I

708
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,140
ever hear of any form of seminar from

709
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,778
the subject

710
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,259
so we think it's really really broadly

711
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:11,240
then we really talk about how you think

712
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,099
about

713
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,319
including different opinions different

714
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,899
kinds of culture

715
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,759
different backgrounds different sites

716
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,980
I'm trying to Interior leadership

717
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,079
practice

718
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:27,960
and spend time doing that

719
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,720
and then we get into simulation we've

720
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,460
built a simulation that makes the

721
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,620
participants actually

722
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,798
become members of an organization with

723
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:42,019
some roles and goals things they have to

724
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,019
do timetables they have to use

725
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:49,140
and we let them go or better or worse

726
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,178
things happen people are encouraged to

727
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,340
reflect upon what happened

728
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,960
talk about how they felt about what

729
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,480
happened

730
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,819
what surprised them about the

731
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,058
experiences what might be done

732
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:05,939
differently again it's a lot of fun but

733
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:08,038
there's a lot of Applied trying of

734
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,659
things on precise trying things on

735
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,000
precise that people have already learned

736
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,620
from each other and from the things that

737
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,880
we've talked about earlier

738
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,859
and

739
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,039
and trying to make a difference in the

740
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:22,319
actual simulation

741
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,658
then we talk about how to motivate which

742
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,740
seems like it's an obvious thing I'm

743
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,620
trying to spend a lot of time with

744
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,659
corporate leaders who have assumptions

745
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:33,058
that are fairly old dated and based on

746
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:36,059
no science whatsoever

747
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:37,500
how you actually motivate people

748
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,778
and

749
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,000
the link to Bear all the different

750
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,640
cultures that we're working on Union and

751
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,619
how motivation really differs across

752
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,720
culture but we also talk about what

753
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,639
science really does know

754
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,000
think about how to try it out for size

755
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,000
and

756
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,240
graduate work that you're doing graduate

757
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,559
organizations you might be in an

758
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,960
organizations where you're actually

759
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,599
people are working as a deviation

760
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,100
certain organization or summer job or

761
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,099
ultimately going out

762
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:12,298
then we talk about conflict which is of

763
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:15,418
course for those of you who are not only

764
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:18,418
one of my favorite things to do really

765
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:21,240
not be in Conflict but because it's an

766
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,259
opportunity really to change things for

767
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,019
the better

768
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,940
will get unhappy they complain

769
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,500
playing it's an opportunity to

770
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,940
understand

771
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,700
that's how we think about leadership

772
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,740
generally when things blow up it's a

773
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,419
time to think about what it is we are

774
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,700
you know missing

775
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,799
we can be better

776
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,600
role plays with that and go through

777
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,700
cases about the

778
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,798
work with you know protocols and things

779
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,919
that actually work and I think a lot of

780
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,720
fun will actually

781
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,100
encouraging people to go out and try

782
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,519
size

783
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,359
not starting conflicts

784
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,639
figuring out some ways to make

785
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,278
situations

786
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,038
work better

787
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,140
and then lastly the evaluation that we

788
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,379
do of the program is actually built by

789
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,380
the students in the program

790
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,659
so how you think about what it is you

791
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,299
should be learning and how you really

792
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,980
get the students to share whether or not

793
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:23,639
they've learned it

794
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,980
it's a difficult thing that people are

795
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,038
asked at the end of the class to fill

796
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,899
out a sheet

797
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,778
it can often leave things open to

798
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:35,579
question do they really get to share all

799
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:39,898
the things they wish they shared about

800
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:43,259
the a class impact of them or do they

801
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:45,898
not so this is a full class where we

802
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,140
really spend it on

803
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:51,000
how do you know if you've become

804
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,880
successful how do you know if the class

805
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,880
would work to do the things

806
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,620
so the students design the questions and

807
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,539
then we worked

808
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,579
what the answering other questions and

809
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:04,879
analyze the answer

810
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,879
test

811
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,759
classes are three hours long

812
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,759
so it gives us a lot of opportunities

813
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,740
so that's the syllabus

814
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,000
any question on that before we put you

815
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,000
into an exercise

816
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:26,960
yes if you've kept track of the

817
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,819
graduates and where they have ended up

818
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,319
since you've been teaching it well some

819
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:35,158
of them are now by Facebook friends

820
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:38,278
Parish of thought right it

821
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,899
many are with us on LinkedIn Marvin may

822
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,940
have some more formal links I know I

823
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:45,058
hear from the students many of the

824
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,960
students myself via email as they travel

825
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:47,960
throughout the world

826
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,658
that they've learned yeah I guess that's

827
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,759
your question do you not have a formal

828
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,740
way of collecting information on what

829
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,839
these students do we're lucky if we can

830
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,759
do that in our own apartment section and

831
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,339
we have students that come from all over

832
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,720
the campus so it's really hard to keep

833
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,918
track of them unless they voluntarily

834
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,960
let us know what you're doing it's

835
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,220
something but I don't really have a way

836
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,538
of comparing that group with six I think

837
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,058
it's made a real difference in their

838
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:17,879
success but I will say because I've had

839
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,798
people tell me that even though they may

840
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,419
not ever go into a scientific career

841
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,500
they feel what they've learned in this

842
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,019
class is going to help them be a better

843
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,339
person helping with their families I

844
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,538
have them with their friends and all

845
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,939
sorts of relationships they have

846
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,319
throughout their life because this

847
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,298
course essentially is understanding

848
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,079
people how what makes people taken out

849
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:36,079
the operating so

850
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,298
hopefully it helps to become a better

851
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:48,119
person in the relationships

852
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,859
yes which departments have contributed

853
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,719
the most participants to this class

854
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:54,000
where do you think you have the best

855
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,038
buy-in or or where do you think you have

856
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,778
to make more in ruts that's a really

857
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,000
good question I think probably the worst

858
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:02,640
buying or planned scientists and from

859
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,898
there but it's a hard sell for the

860
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,038
planet science Community I mentioned

861
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:07,079
earlier you should be working in your

862
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,239
lab we've had really good buying from

863
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,980
food science almost every year we got

864
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,319
food scientists natural resources have

865
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,440
been really good about exciting students

866
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,859
that way and I'm trying to think we've

867
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:24,780
had students from all over cows actually

868
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:26,279
and increasingly from engineering

869
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,919
again it's different from the business

870
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,019
school last year

871
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,699
an indication that uh

872
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,159
it's interesting when the scientists are

873
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,939
doing more about managing than the

874
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,940
social business

875
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,079
and we have had students that you know

876
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,358
we Define life sciences in a very broad

877
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,338
sense and here you know anything that

878
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,440
involves people in a sense with a

879
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,179
scientific approach scientists so we

880
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,519
have been getting quite a few students

881
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,820
from the safe development sociology as

882
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,139
well as a one or two from maybe out so

883
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,240
it's really it's one of the things that

884
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,799
makes it really fun is that the students

885
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,439
come from all over and their experiences

886
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,460
that if you want to talk about you know

887
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,260
bad examples that's great yeah

888
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,059
well have you ever seen this happening

889
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,440
there's all that lots of stories if

890
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,239
everyone were from planet Sciences we

891
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,039
wouldn't have that basically but because

892
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,659
of all over the place that's the good

893
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,480
but I would like to see more plant

894
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,539
scientists

895
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,059
it was interesting I participated

896
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:30,838
focus groups or the strategic planning

897
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,820
process that is the last year and and

898
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,279
one of the things we heard from graduate

899
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,559
students in these groups is that they

900
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,540
are routinely exploring

901
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,940
leadership training where they can find

902
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:44,940
it and often thing it's a dumbass don't

903
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,700
tell proposition they don't tell their

904
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,460
advisors that they're pursuing it for

905
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:51,960
fair they'll have a discussion about

906
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,420
maybe the time could be differently

907
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,858
spent and with no malfeasance on the

908
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,358
part of the people who are guiding them

909
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:59,159
it's just that they have a lot to do in

910
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,679
a short time to do it let's actually

911
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:05,598
funded so the students were very mindful

912
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,598
of that but craving these

913
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,779
yeah

914
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,880
and there were actually some people

915
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,039
who've been through the class who were

916
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,119
in their

917
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,960
proselytizing for us I didn't have to

918
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,960
say the word it was great

919
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,578
another question

920
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,099
yes okay I just I haven't formulated

921
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,780
this really well but when I think about

922
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,760
my own experiences learning to work with

923
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,500
people and organize with groups and

924
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,119
things like that many of the most where

925
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,820
I've learned the most has been actually

926
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,500
trying to do it so working in community

927
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,019
groups and things like that and so I'm

928
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,659
just wondering how you think that might

929
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:45,059
be better incorporated into a graduate

930
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,819
education opportunities to do authentic

931
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:50,820
working groups and reflect on it in

932
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,980
community with other students

933
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,619
this is an interesting question I think

934
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,838
it's it's

935
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,640
students who come to Ithaca have to get

936
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,259
their feet wet and how it is to wear a

937
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,199
winter coat you know what I mean they

938
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,240
have to learn the local culture learn to

939
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,279
kind of opportunities there are not just

940
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,919
to be a graduate student organizations

941
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,280
or clubs but to be involved where they

942
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,280
live and doing other volunteer work or

943
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,380
not doing Project work and some of them

944
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,040
do and some of them don't

945
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,900
I don't know if I have any guides or how

946
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,940
this should work are there any thought

947
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,740
about this it's a good question it's a

948
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,200
really good question and I mean I think

949
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,578
for the same reasons that students feel

950
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,559
they didn't have time to take the class

951
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,240
they also don't have time to get heavily

952
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,420
involved in the community to work or

953
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,039
other than certain activity so I don't

954
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,539
know how we can

955
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,880
I don't know if we can enforce that

956
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,639
change but I think what we can do as

957
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,059
professors is we can model that behavior

958
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:53,338
and show you can also be an excellent

959
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:55,559
scientist but also be involved in the

960
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:57,420
community group or two and do things

961
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:01,039
outside the classroom and invite

962
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,039
students into that community

963
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:07,760
between role models is an important to

964
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,760
sort of open the door

965
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,079
sort of related to the earlier question

966
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,800
um as you know there's this thing called

967
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,700
engaged engaged learning at Cornell

968
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,260
primarily I think targeting

969
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:21,299
undergraduates

970
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,740
he's also engaged for search which would

971
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,960
be appropriate for The Graduate students

972
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:27,179
but it raises the question for me is

973
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,679
this restricted to grad students or

974
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,500
would it be open for upper level

975
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:33,358
undergrads but for that matter if

976
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,800
engaged Cornell is going to succeed if

977
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,358
we're going to have students out there

978
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,039
in communities during the summer or

979
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:40,319
otherwise engaging with real

980
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,519
organizations real communities you see

981
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,220
this big Cornell is going to need a

982
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,500
suite of courses like this that all

983
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:50,219
students may be required to do before

984
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,159
they go out there yeah so you know our

985
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:54,659
class has the Supreme 20 and 25 and

986
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:57,358
that's like ideal

987
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,219
for this sort of this thing and if we

988
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,500
open it up and we want I wouldn't

989
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:03,259
necessarily want more than that probably

990
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,440
30.

991
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,540
but I also think that we did have one

992
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,559
undergraduate kind of she's not getting

993
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,559
somehow I don't know exactly

994
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:17,219
she was a good contributor but the life

995
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,900
experience was very different for her

996
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,819
than it was in graduate students like

997
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,980
Maria yep it's been a couple years

998
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,740
overseas and Peace Corps and she just

999
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:29,039
had a life experience it was quite a bit

1000
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,379
more bricks than them so I think that

1001
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,179
yeah absolutely courses for undergrads

1002
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,099
used to be good but I don't know if you

1003
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:38,338
can mix them in the same classroom and

1004
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:42,300
have the same result and accounts asked

1005
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,659
an undergraduate leadership class that's

1006
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,519
we're here I believe they have it was so

1007
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,299
popular that I think they're now running

1008
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,300
two sections

1009
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,099
hey Marvin yes this is uh Kristen smart

1010
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,660
I was wondering if you guys talk about

1011
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:02,280
diversity and Leadership I know that in

1012
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,440
Academia that's one thing that we're

1013
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,000
frequently looking for and so I'm

1014
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,740
wondering if there's any way to include

1015
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,780
that in the leadership experience it's

1016
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,838
already in there we talk about it an

1017
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,119
awful lot we try to challenge

1018
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:18,119
assumptions that are made about how to

1019
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,539
do this work but we try to really talk

1020
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,940
fairly openly and honestly about what we

1021
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,219
know to be going on some of the pitfalls

1022
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,780
of doing this kind of work and how to be

1023
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:29,098
thinking about it in the viruses

1024
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,740
different players or anything wouldn't

1025
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:34,260
that be a fair assessment yeah I would

1026
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:36,618
say it's first and foremost on our minds

1027
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,060
as we go through all these is

1028
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,220
appreciation of diversity and how to

1029
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:43,500
handle diversity how to manage it and

1030
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:45,139
work with it to be organic I think of it

1031
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,820
as a productive

1032
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:49,980
here's a person with a perspective a

1033
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,559
different skill set it won't that really

1034
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,380
help our country

1035
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,078
did that answer the question

1036
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,320
yeah

1037
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:05,640
Pam I'm in your research what do

1038
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:09,119
employed employers leaders uh point out

1039
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,759
as the chief motivators for the

1040
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,760
employees with whom they work

1041
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,760
hilariously

1042
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,180
corporations in particular

1043
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,099
tend to rely on things that can be a

1044
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:28,980
more than one size of its own approach

1045
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,859
okay

1046
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,240
we all have Performance Based today this

1047
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:37,858
is a popular approach to motivation the

1048
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,799
assumption is particularly after the

1049
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:43,219
economic downturn that if you have a job

1050
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,220
you should

1051
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,480
you know and if we're willing to give

1052
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,119
you an amk and increase based on some

1053
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,880
way that we assess how you've done then

1054
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,680
you should be more motivated

1055
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,960
enforce but the research literature

1056
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,659
really doesn't support that except in a

1057
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,300
few very specific very different contain

1058
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,639
cases so we sort of take apart the

1059
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,440
populists about leadership whether it's

1060
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:09,480
motivated

1061
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,280
talk about what kind of research is

1062
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,320
there actually

1063
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,599
um

1064
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,920
especially as we're looking at it

1065
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,140
important non-western thinking into how

1066
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,780
is that all about working in the U.S

1067
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,779
with you know Western based ways of

1068
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,760
different businesses so what other

1069
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,560
motivators are there that are the most

1070
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,540
successful particularly in a

1071
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,480
non-corporate setting well I think

1072
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:37,920
you've heard some of it even at the

1073
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,980
beginning we asked people to talk about

1074
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,720
characteristics the notion of being

1075
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,338
passionate about what you do if you're

1076
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,578
going to be passionate about what you do

1077
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:49,259
you have to be given some autonomy to do

1078
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,760
it

1079
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:57,359
so for some freedom to be able to do the

1080
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,800
work that you're tested to do within

1081
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,639
certain matters too but to be able to

1082
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,140
add something of yourself to that part

1083
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:06,779
second thing is really to be able to be

1084
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:08,519
a lifelong learner you can't just be

1085
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,400
doing the same thing day in day out you

1086
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,500
have to be able to explore and add to

1087
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,599
your skill set if you like your

1088
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,940
computer anymore

1089
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,280
which those are two really big things

1090
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,980
that people need to have and they need

1091
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,200
often to be able to be recognized as

1092
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,719
being a value member

1093
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,578
whatever that is and

1094
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,139
what we often see

1095
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,119
when I talk to people in the corporate

1096
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,699
world

1097
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:38,579
and also not the non-profit world is

1098
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:40,259
this notion that what people really want

1099
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,060
is more pay

1100
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,560
and then if I give a person you want to

1101
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:45,719
pay a promise to give them more pay

1102
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,880
they're going to do more work

1103
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,858
I don't think there's anything to back

1104
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,280
that up or there's some slim data again

1105
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:55,078
very finite cases but if you say to a

1106
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,540
person that you bring meaning you bring

1107
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,640
skills you bring competencies we don't

1108
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:02,159
have here's what we trust you to do

1109
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,659
here's what you know how can you help us

1110
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,838
do it better

1111
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,098
people tend to open up so what we focus

1112
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:09,659
on is if you're thinking about

1113
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,720
leadership

1114
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:15,199
it's not taking a person as a finite

1115
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,539
contribution

1116
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:21,480
plugging them in and sort of lashing

1117
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,679
them over the head things like to pay a

1118
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,960
nice desk

1119
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:27,139
to make them work hard and we're talking

1120
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,818
about optimizing

1121
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:31,980
you want to see people bring more of

1122
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:33,659
themselves to the work because they're

1123
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,159
the last of doing because they're

1124
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:37,940
getting something out of it even as

1125
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:37,940
they're added support

1126
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,099
I like to say too that that's one thing

1127
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,500
I sort of fall coming out for we spent

1128
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:49,140
an ignorant amount of time performance

1129
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,000
dialogues and then rating people and

1130
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,980
figuring out how much they're going to

1131
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,818
make and it's always around two percent

1132
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,920
getting parsed out per second and all

1133
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:00,599
the days you know that doesn't motivate

1134
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,599
people at all yeah as a research

1135
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,940
institution we continue to follow the

1136
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,559
the model which so it doesn't work good

1137
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,300
we spent a lot of time go ahead

1138
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,219
Department chairs it's been a huge

1139
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,660
amount of time worrying about that a

1140
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:14,159
little bit of money just doesn't really

1141
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,598
give us other things about motivate

1142
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,078
people and we don't talk about those

1143
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,079
people

1144
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,599
well thank you we're out of time really

1145
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,599
appreciate your attention

1146
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:36,420
this has been a production of Cornell

1147
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,420
University on the web at cornell.edu
