1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,330
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,330
University

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,349
to start we'll just sort of walk through

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:17,050
some of the basics behind vegetable

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,149
raita trial garden project a little bit

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,849
of the background and where you can find

7
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,799
more information find footage for the

8
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:30,789
special variety trails garden project

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:32,859
you'll go to citizen science and scroll

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,929
down a little bit and then here it is if

11
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,780
you click here this will bring it to the

12
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:41,378
page that have all the information for v

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,480
vtg so this project is sort of a

14
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:46,179
demonstration garden and we've done it

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:51,219
in the past I think for maybe four years

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:52,738
in 2011 to 2014 or so but it's sort of

17
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:56,950
been on hold so we're really happy to

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:59,140
relaunch the project for 2017 every year

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,590
has a different theme think of the

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,198
pastures in some companion garden theme

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,060
or ideological card games or pollinator

22
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,938
friendly games but this year's theme

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:17,590
we're just doing big yields in small

24
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:25,388
places so here you can find the design

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:27,609
draft so this spirit there um are

26
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:30,429
several plantings we have a spring

27
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:34,149
planting that will go in you know march

28
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:39,189
to april and here are the nine beds so

29
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:42,670
each bed is three feet by three feet and

30
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:45,938
then we'll have a summer planting goes

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,829
in and around May some of the events

32
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:52,508
stay the same throughout the season and

33
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:56,168
some of them change and then we'll also

34
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:58,329
have a fall planting but not all of the

35
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:01,090
beds will be planted in the fall but if

36
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,649
you'd like to plant all of them that is

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,118
totally cool and you can do that but

38
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,829
here are just some suggestions so we

39
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:07,828
have some garlic and some cover crafts

40
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,439
so also

41
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,900
on the website you'll find a timeline so

42
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,229
this will sort of guide you through

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,209
month by month everything that should be

44
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:30,060
done so here we are in December today is

45
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,030
opening day for registration and

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,949
registration closes on the very first in

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,370
March will be mailing out seeds for that

48
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:42,039
spring planting so you will receive the

49
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,829
seats by mail and then you can directly

50
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,378
so them early in the spring we'll also

51
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:48,670
have another webinar in mid-march to

52
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:52,030
sort of get everyone on the same page

53
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:56,679
touch base answer any questions and go

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,140
forward to the planting season and then

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,870
may amazed a big month so we'll have a

56
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:04,179
plant pickup day at Cornell I'm a fourth

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,759
so these are the transplants that will

58
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,760
be started by an organic gardening class

59
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,739
here on campus and then you can pick up

60
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,358
the transplants they'll be at the

61
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,908
tomatoes you know more of the tender

62
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,760
perhaps I'm maybe forth and we'll also

63
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:21,039
have some educational opportunities on

64
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,810
campus as well we're going to connect

65
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,759
with the Cornell botanical gardens and

66
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,669
for one of their vegetable gardens there

67
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,918
and also toured the dolmen Hill student

68
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,799
farm here on campus so it will be a day

69
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,620
to pick up your plans but also to

70
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:44,049
connect with other educators and tore

71
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:45,730
some some relevant gardens then in July

72
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,150
we'll have another webinar another

73
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:51,729
opportunity to touch base as you are

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,699
planting and maintaining and also

75
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:57,310
harvesting part of this project really

76
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,780
focuses on the vegetable varieties for

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,719
gardeners database and I'll talk about

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,489
that in a few minutes but this will be

79
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,799
the webinar in July will be a time to

80
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,889
sort of go over the database how do you

81
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,280
use it big questions will be answered at

82
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,280
that point

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,160
so I guess I'll just use that as a

84
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,569
springboard to show you the database so

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,280
this is the vegetable varieties for

86
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:29,129
gardeners database and it's a really

87
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:32,399
excellent resource um I think it's used

88
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:35,668
nationally is it used internationally at

89
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,038
all it is yeah so it's pretty cool so

90
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:40,168
say you you know pardon if the guy New

91
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,478
York for a beer today and you're really

92
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,339
curious about what tomatoes do well in

93
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,219
your area well you can go on in this

94
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,529
database and see what have what what

95
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,770
varieties have done well for others and

96
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,959
it's similar climate um you just create

97
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,089
an account it doesn't cost anything you

98
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,120
don't get any spam emails or any day is

99
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:03,439
really simple um and you'll be able to

100
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,250
read a little bit about the variety um

101
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:12,360
you know about the plant type and you

102
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,160
know how prafulla fruitful it is and you

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,229
can maybe discover if it would be a good

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,169
fit for what you're looking for when

105
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:21,240
this gives you an idea of what this

106
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,879
databases I look out so you can see I

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,569
mean people are coming from all over the

108
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,000
country it's pretty neat so now I'd like

109
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,560
to talk a little bit about

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,220
responsibilities so if you do want to

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,589
participate in this project um I'll tell

112
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,510
you first everything that that we do on

113
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,049
our end and then tell you everything

114
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,719
that you would do on your end so we

115
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:49,199
provide seeds and plants for the spring

116
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,729
and summer plantings um we provide you

117
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,819
the design plan which is right up here

118
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:58,709
um we provide you with signage so each

119
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,860
of these beds would get their own sign

120
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:04,439
for visitors to read and I learn a

121
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,389
little bit about what's going there we

122
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:14,668
provide you that timeline and checklist

123
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:16,408
which I showed you um and then we also

124
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,689
provide you a template for your local

125
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:20,519
plan of work including evaluation

126
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,769
templates and lorries going to talk a

127
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,680
little bit about that from the end of

128
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:27,599
the webinar and then we

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,918
support and guidance throughout the

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,350
growing season so if you have any

131
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,508
questions or concerns we're happy to

132
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,550
help you out we do have two other

133
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,629
webinars scheduled so those will be

134
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,100
great times to touch base as well and

135
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,918
then sort of your end with the

136
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,960
responsibility so you plant maintain and

137
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,418
harvest the vegetable variety trial

138
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,258
gardens you'll enter data into that

139
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:54,149
database that I just showed you you will

140
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,740
share progress and photos throughout the

141
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,709
season we'd love to see how things are

142
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,240
doing and just hear about the different

143
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,370
varieties maybe some are doing better

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
than others maybe some counties are

145
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,149
having different experiences we just

146
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,519
love to hear about it and then you'll

147
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:11,029
also complete an evaluation at the end

148
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,490
of the season and so this helps us know

149
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:20,429
any1 1l and what we could do differently

150
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:24,990
for next year so here you'll see there's

151
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,569
the design the and then the timeline and

152
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,939
the registration form so what kind of

153
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,348
David do you need to collect well Fiona

154
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,240
said it would be great for us to get

155
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:35,848
just general updates that would be just

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,120
anecdotal data but what data we really

157
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:42,029
want what's one of the varieties that we

158
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,280
have planned yeah um black seeded sixth

159
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:49,339
and lettuce okay so we would put in the

160
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,339
finder um Simpson I think that will work

161
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,709
and then do search and then his black

162
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,019
seeded since and lettuce alright so you

163
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,839
if you choose to grow black seed Simpson

164
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:06,870
lettuce what we want / encourage you to

165
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:10,049
do and ins to register your garden as on

166
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,699
this site so you might choose a name you

167
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,000
know if you're not registered as an

168
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,038
individual I would register you as a as

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,658
a county organization so you would go

170
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,949
under blog and sorry I should've ugh it

171
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:25,408
in first I forgot you might not be

172
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,439
registered so you might go under log in

173
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:30,779
and you say not registered with our site

174
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,719
you would add a garden profile I

175
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,538
wouldn't call that garden use some name

176
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,060
um that recognizes your Cornell

177
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,879
Cooperative Extension site as the name

178
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,109
and it's little an individual might do

179
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,450
it differently if they're doing it at

180
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,070
home and then you fill this out so you

181
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,589
do need to register if you're not

182
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,379
registered and then you would go back to

183
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:59,970
that lacks of once you're registered um

184
00:08:52,379 --> 00:09:01,919
you can um then you can add a review I'm

185
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,290
logged in now and so once you're

186
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,599
registered get this blog and successful

187
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:09,480
this is what we're expecting you each

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,829
each demo site to share so just a

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,899
general review that would just be

190
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:15,149
verbally what you thought of what

191
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,120
happened and then you provide overall

192
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,129
rating and maybe you can run the mouse

193
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,519
over that drop-down menu and you

194
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:27,509
basically give it 125 start on overall

195
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,789
rating taste yield ease reliability and

196
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,069
that's just you know how easy was it and

197
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,929
unyielding taste is obvious and it's

198
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,629
kind of personal so you might have to

199
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:38,969
take a consensus and then if you want to

200
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,338
upload a picture you can upload a

201
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,560
picture I think that's works this is

202
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,779
like a interface that we developed a

203
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,958
long time ago and it functions usually

204
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:50,759
but uh and we think the load picture

205
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,429
still works but let us know if it

206
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,889
doesn't and then you just save it and I

207
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,929
will save my excited right anything so

208
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,990
that's that's what we're expecting for

209
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:04,019
that and though can you participate only

210
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,198
part of the programming yes you can so

211
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,698
if you feel that the spring planting is

212
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:11,819
something that you're super interested

213
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:16,198
in but maybe you don't have the capacity

214
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:20,970
or the volunteers to do it like a summer

215
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:23,939
in the fall that's totally fine um you

216
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,310
can also substitute plant say oh man I

217
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,050
really don't like microgreens our

218
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,059
volunteers feel like my grades we don't

219
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:32,789
know how we would use these so you can

220
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:35,099
do a different planting in that bag you

221
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:39,629
would have to just adjust the signage

222
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:43,290
template yeah so if you do do the

223
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,789
partial season planting you would have

224
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:47,159
to provide your own seeds and

225
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:48,838
transplants so if you do the full one

226
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,990
you get to see to the transplant sweet

227
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,880
if you just do partial

228
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,310
planting you get you have to provide

229
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,649
them is that clear so what we're doing

230
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,379
is incentivizing people who do the whole

231
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,970
thing get the plants from seeds if we

232
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,278
have extras we will share those with

233
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,959
people from doing partials and we've

234
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:09,009
still even if you're doing partials

235
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,419
please register because um we might be

236
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,610
able to accommodate that but we're

237
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:16,088
giving priority to people are doing the

238
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,759
full thing with our budget and if we

239
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,589
don't have a budget all spent on those

240
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,179
people who are doing the full thing we

241
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,370
might be able to accommodate partial

242
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:29,289
it's in place but they're not the same

243
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,269
size um you can still that's okay so we

244
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,990
just give this design based on this 3 by

245
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,208
3 bed if you have bigger beds you know

246
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,600
you wouldn't have to think through your

247
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:43,269
own adjustment of how many plants so you

248
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,730
can still do it but you'll have to think

249
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,829
through those adjustments or you know

250
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,680
consult with us and we certainly help

251
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,509
with that and where can i interject is

252
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,159
really plan so if you are starting from

253
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,600
scratch and you don't already have the

254
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,269
garden beds established we have a

255
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
document that will help you sort of walk

256
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,549
through the process so this is on the

257
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,009
website recommended site prep so walk me

258
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:08,620
through the soil to lay out building the

259
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:12,929
bags what materials are best fencing

260
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,669
signage and there's even a video on our

261
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,949
website that you can watch this just

262
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,719
three minutes and it shows how one of

263
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,470
these gardens sites was established

264
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:28,720
before and then another question was

265
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:31,480
will this only be for 2017 no we have

266
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,300
been trying to do this I think since 20

267
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,740
but what was that year 2012 yeah we've

268
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,528
been doing been trying to do this

269
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,019
special varieties trial project for the

270
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:44,439
last five years so we're very thankful

271
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:47,919
that fiona is is taking the lead ins

272
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,529
developed all this support network for

273
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,469
it so that's why we're launching yet

274
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:55,600
full on this year and our plan is to do

275
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,240
it every year so come up with a

276
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,509
different design in future years or

277
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,850
maybe because they're all annuals we can

278
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,639
modify the design

279
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,680
based on your on how it goes for you and

280
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,049
the feedback you provide maybe you would

281
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,088
even throw out suggestions on what you'd

282
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:15,508
like to see is part of the plantain and

283
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:20,220
2080 so the hope is that this is on

284
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:22,680
going into the future all right let me

285
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:30,079
just show you one more thing it's not

286
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:32,669
asking questions I love this project so

287
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,099
under garden guidance we do have that

288
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:37,948
pollinator friendly thing under garden

289
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:43,019
guidance we have food gardening and

290
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:45,299
growing vegetables we have this selected

291
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,810
list of Edgehill varieties / gardeners

292
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:52,049
in New York State and so again this is

293
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:55,588
for 2017 we create this every year and

294
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:58,318
so there's some varieties you want to

295
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,940
get some of those varieties off this

296
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:01,860
list but some of them aren't on this

297
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,620
list so the other thing that you'll be

298
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,690
helping us do is if you put the data

299
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,429
into the federal varieties for partners

300
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,040
website that helps inform this document

301
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,679
if if the stuff is good right the only

302
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,799
what's the recommended stuff in here but

303
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,769
you can see one of sorry this is got a

304
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,379
mouse out of control so some of the

305
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,839
varieties on this list that have this

306
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,328
asterisk on them they came from

307
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,459
recommendations from New Yorkers from

308
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,379
the vegetable variety list so that's

309
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,989
ultimately where we're going we want to

310
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,049
repeat this many years and we want New

311
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,889
York State gardeners and our

312
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,620
associations you're doing vegetables

313
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:47,339
trial gardens to be informing this

314
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,060
document that's the overarching of a

315
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:54,300
long-term goal is that gardeners are the

316
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:58,619
ones who who help help us come up with

317
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,448
this list um question comes in do you

318
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,970
have suggestions on how to break up the

319
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:07,919
maintenance work among volunteers oh oh

320
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,680
wait I got an answer from Laura in wayne

321
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,729
county in wayne county we assigned each

322
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,278
interested volunteer a bed

323
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,560
an avid signage this bed is maintained

324
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:22,620
by Mars Master Gardener volunteer and

325
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:26,708
their name there's some accountability

326
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,209
it maybe it's a couple names and so the

327
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:36,429
bed is only three by three and um and so

328
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:39,939
that's that that was on there we go we

329
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:42,009
did this beautiful bed mmm and anybody

330
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,100
else have any suggestions I like that

331
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:49,269
one I think every county is so different

332
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,159
and you know their volunteer force and

333
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,198
the time that their educators have to

334
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,299
maintain this so it might be a little

335
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,069
bit different for everybody but if you

336
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,750
have done this project in the past and

337
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,519
you've found that your way of

338
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,120
maintenance works really well please

339
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,310
share another strategy that I've heard

340
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,490
is so there's always a time in the

341
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:12,518
garden and here each week when there's

342
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,100
an educational opportunity but while

343
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,730
you're doing the education you might do

344
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,610
a little maintenance at that same time

345
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,980
so other resources on this page yeah I

346
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,440
didn't dive into those okay what we also

347
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:32,889
wanted to share with you is some tools

348
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:35,079
to help you a report your annual

349
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:39,399
reporting as we always do and also

350
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:42,159
measure your success so we have an

351
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:47,078
evaluation some sample evaluation forms

352
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:49,149
and they open up in words so I think I

353
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,088
got it down they'll download if I click

354
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:55,120
on them and then so these are just some

355
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,060
sample questions I guess I'll open it up

356
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,649
it's going to be okay it will open up in

357
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,778
word and I think I have to scoot over to

358
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,549
word are you showing the screen desktop

359
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:06,910
so they should be able to see it okay

360
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:09,279
good so it's opening up hopefully y'all

361
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,990
can start to see the word document open

362
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,039
up so you can see she has a simple

363
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:18,338
evaluation form that you might have ever

364
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,568
you have an event or some other that

365
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:26,750
maintenance learning time you can use

366
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:29,180
this form and then we also we have

367
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,109
other form of the other evaluation form

368
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:37,640
is more open-ended questions the other

369
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:41,299
thing i want to share is some about your

370
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,550
plan or your local plan of work so some

371
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,009
of you educate errs might think that

372
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:49,099
this looks familiar because you've had

373
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:52,099
to fill out a local plan of work so you

374
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:55,699
might choose your food gardening and the

375
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,980
special friday trial garden to meet one

376
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,279
of these outcomes which is part of our

377
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,990
whole plan of work and so she really

378
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,819
just put this document here with the

379
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,769
thought that you would pick the you

380
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:09,710
would delete the things that weren't

381
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:13,039
relevant to what your focus was and then

382
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,440
you would keep the others and so um that

383
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,099
was a little background and so she she's

384
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,120
kind of filled this in for you um so it

385
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:25,699
would be easy for you to do your program

386
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,919
planning paperwork that you all have to

387
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,240
do you can sort of choose she made in

388
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,370
different colors so you can sort of

389
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,680
choose your theme and then work through

390
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,349
the whole thing that way with the hope

391
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,049
that this really leads into writing a

392
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:42,740
very easy success story once you've

393
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:47,389
collected some information too so she

394
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:50,089
added that tool right to that website so

395
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,540
if you go to the staff webpage under

396
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:55,279
units organizational development program

397
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:57,440
planning and development I just want to

398
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,269
point out some changes and state by plan

399
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,360
of work that impacts our Master Gardener

400
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:04,970
volunteer program so that local plan

401
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,089
work template here it is right here you

402
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,860
that that's the one she filled in but

403
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,529
you can get it on that staff website

404
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:16,579
there's the statewide plan work from

405
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:18,589
which Fiona drew those outcomes from and

406
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:20,960
I just want to point out how it has

407
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:24,679
changed in the realm of the Master

408
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,569
Gardener volunteer program and there are

409
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,940
six parts than the plan of work and

410
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:31,730
sorry I'm going to scroll electro rather

411
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,500
fast all going to the last number 61

412
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,559
because that is community economic

413
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,349
vitality examples of statewide regional

414
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,819
initiatives at all within this plan

415
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:42,668
work include the Master Gardener

416
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:44,829
volunteer program land use in public

417
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,600
spaces you know we might be doing some

418
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,279
work related to land use in public

419
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,699
spaces with a restauranteur volunteer

420
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:53,529
program and this is a brand-new point in

421
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,620
the plan of work it was worded

422
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:58,660
differently previously it was not called

423
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:02,739
land use in residential spaces before

424
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,570
and and you can see here the number of

425
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,279
residents practicing management tactics

426
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,538
and home lawns and gardens and

427
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,408
landscapes that support environmental

428
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:14,019
stewardship and a sustainable community

429
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:17,230
so I think the bulk of our support of

430
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:19,889
our community falls in this area for

431
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,839
Master Gardener volunteer program and

432
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,850
there are some footnotes here because

433
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,639
you might be doing something a little

434
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:30,038
more specific and that you might want to

435
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,830
affiliate with a different outcome in

436
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:34,808
the plan of work and so I wrote those

437
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,879
out here if you're doing something

438
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:39,940
focuses on climate change adaption and

439
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,970
mitigation Water Resources biodiversity

440
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,759
natural resource protection you go back

441
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:49,150
up this whole document scroll back up to

442
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,849
the second portion of the plan of work

443
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:58,380
under climate change there's a check out

444
00:20:51,849 --> 00:21:00,908
2.1 2.4 and 2.7 there that's really a

445
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,190
bank codes by i think i want includes

446
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:08,260
biodiversity and then in 3.7 in the

447
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,929
natural resource the environment and

448
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,269
natural resource one also covers those

449
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,720
sorts of things if that's a thrust of

450
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,759
your program and your head or in the

451
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,220
future if by chance you're focusing on

452
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,440
compost waste management if you look at

453
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,740
the third part of the plan Environment

454
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,110
and Natural Resources sustainable energy

455
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,599
3.6 and 3.7 deal with composting and

456
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:34,000
waste management and then if you're

457
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,969
focusing on school community home and

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,710
food gardening you would refer to the

459
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,069
plan of work of nutrition food safety

460
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,019
and security and obesity and prevention

461
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,149
4.4 talks about food security one

462
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,240
there's some background and Fiona pulled

463
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,280
some of that back

464
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,808
into that plan of work they've already

465
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:55,428
spelled out for you here so this usually

466
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:57,200
it also includes activities include the

467
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:59,870
Master Gardener volunteer program seeks

468
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,049
supper program youth grow is also

469
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:04,669
affiliated with us so that might be one

470
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:08,480
of the things that you're the thrust of

471
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,970
your program is to to see changes in the

472
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,558
number of people growing their own food

473
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,089
well thanks everybody and look for you

474
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,579
reach out with questions we're happy to

475
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:19,220
continue this conversation this has been

476
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:23,169
a production of Cornell University on

477
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,170
the web at cornell.edu
