1
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:09,939
yeah and so I emailed Simon just kind of

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:12,349
on a whim while I was in Indonesia

3
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:16,670
jet-lagged and thought that it would be

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,829
cool if he was able to speak to our

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,440
class and within the first we melee

6
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:23,059
agreed which was really surprising

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,890
something why I thought maybe podcast

8
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,989
producers were more intimidating when

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:34,219
they are there's very nice people too

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:36,379
and so he is very graciously agreed to

11
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,780
kind of talk about how radio lab puts

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,270
together their podcasts and kind of

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,399
targets the general public but a lot of

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,130
the podcasts are wrong kind of current

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,350
science trends or kind of philosophical

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,179
questions that kind of are pretty deep

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,219
and they're trying to repack them for a

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,850
way that the general public finds

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,899
interesting or not you guys I mean just

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,350
in case some of you guys aren't aware

21
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:02,570
radio lab in 2007 got the National

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,790
Academies communication award for its

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,459
imaginative use of radio to make science

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,590
accessible to broad audiences and in

25
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:12,319
2010 and 2014 they got the Peabody

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,829
Awards for their podcast which I'm

27
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,869
pretty sure is basically like the Oscars

28
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:21,319
they do a very good job and I'll pass it

29
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:28,189
over to Simon and youth ourselves now is

30
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:30,199
it recording yes yes he does all right

31
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,810
cool um yeah it's good to be here good

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,079
to see all of your happy faces this this

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,478
afternoon so yeah it's like I guess I'm

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,060
more interested in having a discussion

35
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,129
than me lecturing about anything in

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,530
particular but a little bit about what

37
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:48,140
we are what we do and what I do

38
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,299
specifically for the show so yeah as

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,349
we've mentioned we're we're like a radio

40
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:56,630
documentary program so if you think like

41
00:01:54,349 --> 00:02:00,609
I think like feature writing for a

42
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:03,349
magazine turned into the audio form or

43
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:06,049
like a film documentary turned into the

44
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:09,378
audio form and particularly what we try

45
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,480
to do is we try to find stories that are

46
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,068
filled with narrative tension so like

47
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,139
any movie or television show that you

48
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,579
watch they're creating a story that

49
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,019
makes you want to stick

50
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,320
makes you want to listen to what's or

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,760
watch what's gonna happen next but not

52
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,189
just that in our stories as well we're

53
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,370
trying to explore some question

54
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,900
typically typically through the

55
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,750
characters or through the individuals

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,789
story that we that were that we're

57
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,909
telling so I think the best example of

58
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:40,159
that was a couple years there one of one

59
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:44,120
example of this is I did a story several

60
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:47,539
years back profiling this Texas oil

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,689
tycoon who also happened to be a trophy

62
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,409
hunter and essentially he went to

63
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:55,879
Namibia

64
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:59,319
he paid $350,000 and bought the right to

65
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:03,829
shoot an endangered rhino in Namibia and

66
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:06,019
essentially this story then is from like

67
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,489
the moment he buys this thing through to

68
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,439
him shooting the thing exploring the

69
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,680
question like okay on its face this guy

70
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,000
seems like a total who is doing

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,520
terrible things for the world but is

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,469
that the case so it becomes a six

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,269
exploration of what is conservation in

74
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,769
the 21st century and how do things is

75
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:27,319
sort of an intuitive or ironic is

76
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,810
killing animals how does that feed back

77
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,879
into protecting them

78
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,269
now it's specifically what I do here is

79
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,789
I split my time about 50/50 between

80
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,670
being a reporter and being a producer so

81
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:43,250
that means half my time I'm reading

82
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,689
calling people conducting interviews and

83
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,579
then half the time essentially I'm

84
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,209
taking all of that tape that we get and

85
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:52,549
turning it into the thing that you hear

86
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,400
and that's a very long process or we'll

87
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:59,150
do sort of Draft after Draft after draft

88
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,689
of the story until we think it gets to a

89
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,840
point that we want the world to hear it

90
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:08,959
so yeah that's a little bit of what I do

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,509
what we do and I guess yeah let's I open

92
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
it up for questions or some sort of

93
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,699
discussion you guys can kind of direct

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:21,530
what you want what you want out of me

95
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:26,550
okay cool thank you does anybody first

96
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:29,639
burning question yes

97
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,250
[Music]

98
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,009
hi Carolina so I guess I was just

99
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,100
wondering with all caps you only have

100
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,279
like the ability to hear like voices

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,520
sounds like I guess how do you find that

102
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,369
against challenging or unique if you

103
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,560
don't have written words or any visuals

104
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,819
or anything like that

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,780
yeah well it's interesting it's why it

106
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,639
like writing for radio and storytelling

107
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,469
in radio is obviously different than in

108
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,500
other forms and so a lot of what we're

109
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,700
trying to do is take moves that are

110
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,139
being done in film or in in film

111
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,539
documentary typically actually film

112
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,610
we're looking to to good television

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,900
shows or movies and figure out like what

114
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,930
are the storytelling devices they're

115
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:21,129
using and how can we sort of recreate

116
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,759
those in an audio in a just a purely odd

117
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:27,610
audio medium so like an example of that

118
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,449
is like a one of my colleagues here that

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,330
was watching the opening scene - there

120
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:37,029
will be blood which is this just it

121
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:40,930
opens up to this panoramic shot of like

122
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:43,809
guessing it's western Texas and it then

123
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,550
goes into this story of this man like

124
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,980
picking at the ground trying to find oil

125
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,329
and so the question became like is there

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,990
a way to create a sort of sonic

127
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:55,120
representation of a place like like it

128
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,590
like a desert landscape and how do we do

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:04,360
that in a way that feels authentic to a

130
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,769
degree also subtle and I think what

131
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,360
ended up being done was like there was

132
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,740
some tape of somebody one of our

133
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,060
reporters who was out in the desert sort

134
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,350
of walking through and used hear them

135
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,939
breathing and you hear the wind blowing

136
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,640
through the microphone and then like

137
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,980
maybe a little little bit of music comes

138
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,599
in to not even further to the fact that

139
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,710
okay we're in the southwest this is

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,379
where the story is going to take place

141
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:28,060
the desert is a character in and of

142
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:30,459
itself in this piece so essentially it's

143
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,370
it's a strange act of translation from

144
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,439
from one medium to another but like just

145
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,530
as a practical note one thing we're

146
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,500
always trying to do in audios give you

147
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:44,049
the listeners something to look at which

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,670
sort of counterintuitive but uh like we

149
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,329
think of it that we're making movies for

150
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,189
your ears and in those movies like you

151
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:54,550
got to be able to see exactly what's

152
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:56,170
happening and we're where you need to be

153
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,730
able to imagine exactly what's happening

154
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,790
and we're using different sounds or

155
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,200
we're using different people's voices or

156
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:30,939
a variety of different techniques which

157
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:33,909
I could go into to accomplish that right

158
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:37,120
now how would you get those recordings

159
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,220
without recording like every step of

160
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,189
your day or do you do that like how do

161
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:46,240
you determine what time to bring out a

162
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:50,469
recorder yeah I'm just always like words

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,850
we're just always rolling and so yeah

164
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,760
it's a pain in the ass like I did a

165
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,979
piece a a couple months back following

166
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,099
this City Council New York City Council

167
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:04,569
candidate around for it was a profile of

168
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,550
this guy and I followed him around for

169
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,949
about eight months and at the end of it

170
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,889
I had like a hundred or 120 hours of

171
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,469
tape that was eventually cut down to an

172
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,209
80 minute story so yeah we're just like

173
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,169
we're always recording in the hopes that

174
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:23,259
you that you can capture some tiny

175
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:26,879
little moment that that in fact captures

176
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,879
the idea you're trying to explain I

177
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:33,279
don't care it seems like you're checking

178
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:37,299
me and unbiased as possible when you're

179
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,429
presenting these stories but oh do you

180
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:42,359
keep that unbiased especially if you're

181
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:46,029
doctoring into sometimes story format

182
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,320
yeah that's a really good question I the

183
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,539
like I don't know I don't know if

184
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,350
unbiased is the is the right way to talk

185
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:55,059
about it um what we're doing is we're

186
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,329
telling a story and a story inherently

187
00:08:55,059 --> 00:09:00,659
has

188
00:08:55,328 --> 00:09:00,659
a point of view and it inherently has

189
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,528
some sort of agenda like we're

190
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,719
manipulating you as the listener in very

191
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:09,879
specific moments to feel very specific

192
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,819
things or ask very specific questions

193
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,438
and like that's the actual craft of the

194
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:18,149
production processes like how can we

195
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:23,318
take this sort of mountain of tape and

196
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:25,659
sculpt it into something where you as

197
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:29,469
the listener have an experience and I

198
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:34,139
think what we try to do is with everyone

199
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:37,329
we talk to to meet them

200
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,499
simultaneously in a generous way where

201
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,638
we actually want to hear what they're

202
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,019
saying and we want to understand them

203
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,048
but at the same time in a very critical

204
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:46,419
way where it's my job as an interviewer

205
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:47,948
to stand in for you the listener and ask

206
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,078
the question that though it may be

207
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:52,149
uncomfortable in the moment is the

208
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:57,099
question that needs to be asked and so I

209
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:59,708
guess we're constantly we're constantly

210
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,239
forcing ourselves to stare logically at

211
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:03,878
the things that people are saying and

212
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:05,110
see if they make sense and if they don't

213
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,989
make sense we're gonna tell you it

214
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,360
doesn't make sense but if it does and we

215
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,949
can't argue our way out of it even if it

216
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,688
feels wrong to us in some way we're

217
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:15,328
gonna present that and I think that's

218
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:19,539
one thing I love about the Rhino hunter

219
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:22,118
story is like here's a guy they you

220
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:24,488
really hate with the get go you're we

221
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:26,949
and we sent you up to hate him and yet

222
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:29,829
at the end like I if we did our job

223
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:32,139
right like you're you certainly you

224
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:35,378
might like the guy and if you don't like

225
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,698
him at least you think he's reasonable

226
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,100
whereas you probably thought he was off

227
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:42,519
his rocker in the first 10 minutes of

228
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:46,629
the piece so I think if the I don't know

229
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:49,720
if it's about bias or I think it's about

230
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:52,839
just critically engaging with the ideas

231
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,939
and you as the listener essentially as a

232
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,679
listener to a show like radio lab or

233
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:59,588
This American Life or any number of

234
00:10:56,678 --> 00:11:01,208
documentary programs like you you and

235
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,209
you as an you as a listener saying like

236
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,918
I trust you to manipulate me I trust you

237
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:08,328
to play with my emotions in a way that

238
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:11,838
will be fair

239
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:14,169
and to the people you're presenting and

240
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,420
that's how I look at it and I try to I

241
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:29,118
try to keep that in mind that make sense

242
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:31,988
or if you want you can try okay how like

243
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:35,059
what do you use before you go into

244
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:38,899
creating that podcast you have like a

245
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:42,438
storyboard or like like a scripture or

246
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,409
just kind of come to me you go in yes so

247
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:49,539
the process is so let's say I go and

248
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:51,379
report look Keith or a couple months

249
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,389
what I'm gonna be doing well I'm

250
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:54,739
reporting is taking all that tape so

251
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,239
typically an interview we do here is

252
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:58,970
about 90 minutes long I'm gonna take

253
00:11:56,239 --> 00:12:02,809
that 90 minute interview and and cut it

254
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,610
down to like a 20 minute set of selects

255
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:06,588
as we call them and that sort of like

256
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,568
the hot hot tape from the from the

257
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,149
interview as well as sort of like a

258
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:13,698
presentation of like the arc of the

259
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,778
interview so let's say after two months

260
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:17,748
of reporting I've done ten interviews

261
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:19,578
I've got ten interviews that are now cut

262
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,899
down to 20 minutes long and at that

263
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:23,628
point I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna

264
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,249
listen to everything my editors are

265
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,569
gonna listen to everything and if I have

266
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,439
another producer who's gonna be working

267
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,729
with me they're gonna listen to

268
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:31,938
everything everything meaning the

269
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,220
selects that we have cut from there then

270
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:35,958
it becomes this sort of we'd call it a

271
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,369
storyboarding session and essentially

272
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,198
they like we just go around the room

273
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:42,199
telling each other what we think the

274
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:44,208
story is like I think we start so back

275
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,878
in 2015 buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh

276
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:48,048
buh but then Papa Papa ba and so to

277
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,789
understand this you got to back up

278
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:51,230
buh-buh-buh-buh-byeeeee and we just do

279
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:53,659
that sort of around the room over and

280
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,028
over again until we start to land on a

281
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,100
structure that sound that that seems

282
00:12:56,028 --> 00:13:00,528
like it's going to work and by work I

283
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:05,839
mean like the that we can do it with the

284
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:07,759
tape that it's honest so for most more

285
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,529
than that that it that the emotional

286
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,269
moves that we're trying to make the ways

287
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:14,328
we're trying to make you feel we have

288
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,798
the tape to do it and like one thing

289
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,958
that sets us apart from other shows is

290
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:20,328
brief tangent is just how much we lean

291
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,599
on tape like this American life for

292
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:27,089
example I would

293
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,639
yes 70% of the of the words you hear in

294
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,889
an episode are are tracked narration

295
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:38,730
whereas I would say in our episodes it's

296
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:40,710
closer to 30% or 40% but anyway so once

297
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,659
we have what feels like a structure we

298
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,490
lay that out on paper just super basic

299
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,379
like the basic beats of the story like

300
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,299
we start here we meet this person here

301
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,480
then this happens this is because of

302
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:54,839
that the end and then essentially it

303
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,220
becomes this this game of running into

304
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,250
all of the problems that you didn't

305
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,660
predict when you built this storyboard

306
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,929
or this roadmap for yourself so

307
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,459
obviously like you're it's never gonna

308
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,809
translate perfectly you're never going

309
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,000
to have foreseen all of the potential

310
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,500
problems you're gonna run into when

311
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,419
you're writing in that storyboard and so

312
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,059
then we're just constantly revising or

313
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:19,979
trying new ways new structures either

314
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:24,000
macro or micro to present the ideas in

315
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:28,470
an order that is both compelling and in

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,480
a hopefully informative so it like and

317
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,690
I'll say like when an episode that we do

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,990
in most cases we go through like 20 or

319
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:42,540
30 iterations like we remake episode 20

320
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:45,000
or 30 times before I never goes out so

321
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,679
you're just guessing you're constantly

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,870
guessing until you get to a place that

323
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,229
you that you feel like you've landed in

324
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,379
the right spot so what's kind of an

325
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,850
average like you decide this is a topic

326
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:59,250
up for a podcast they're gonna work on

327
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,980
and then that final product is that is

328
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:06,450
that like a year in the making or is

329
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:12,149
that often yeah it totally totally

330
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:13,560
totally varies um I would say on yeah

331
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:17,000
it's so hard to even give an average

332
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,929
because like I said we just put out

333
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,759
essentially we threw together in three

334
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:22,229
days which we had never done before like

335
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,009
prior to this the quickest thing we've

336
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:28,700
ever turned around was a month but I

337
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:32,669
would say on average the stuff I work on

338
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:35,079
or I have worked on it's typically like

339
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:38,838
three months of reporting

340
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:42,258
and then you're looking at like a month

341
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,939
or two months of production so you're

342
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,798
gathering your tape for three months and

343
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:49,639
then you're making the actual thing for

344
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:51,108
to tip it like again it can be totally

345
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:57,229
different than that but that's some sort

346
00:15:51,109 --> 00:16:00,199
of average I'm gonna pop in with one

347
00:15:57,229 --> 00:16:02,028
more specific to kind of the podcast

348
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:06,588
that you guys do with related to the

349
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:09,198
sciences mm-hmm I guess I'm working with

350
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:11,689
the scientists first off is it is it

351
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:15,099
tough so you to get them to commit to

352
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:17,358
kind of taking a scientific finding or

353
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,509
advanced and technique and turning that

354
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:23,329
into a story that are long I guess like

355
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:25,579
in the sciences what is your approach to

356
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:27,048
kind of take Chris I mean your podcast

357
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:30,168
on CRISPR let's say or something like

358
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:31,759
that like what is your guys's approach

359
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:34,808
to taking something that's very

360
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,129
technically complicated and maybe a

361
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:38,028
scientist that is very knowledgeable and

362
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,788
turning that into something that's

363
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:45,229
digestible for the general public and

364
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:48,318
interesting right yeah and it's not just

365
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:51,528
in Sciences but in any interview I'll go

366
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,389
into like you just have to be dumb like

367
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:55,249
you have to like and you have to be

368
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,629
really certain of the things you don't

369
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:58,308
understand that they're saying so then

370
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,729
you can clearly articulate a question

371
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:04,490
that that answers that for you cuz yeah

372
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,370
a lot of times people are particularly

373
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,138
if it's a if it's a technical issue

374
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,818
they're talking about it with with a

375
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,769
fluency that nobody outside the field

376
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:16,908
has obviously so it's your job as the

377
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:18,888
interviewer or as the producer to to be

378
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:21,559
the idiot in the room and force them to

379
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:22,638
articulate it in a way that even the

380
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:24,199
dumbest person who's going to be

381
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:27,979
listening to the podcast would be able

382
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,330
to understand and also so you can truly

383
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,308
understand it because not only are we

384
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:33,079
talking to these people and using their

385
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:35,089
voice to explain what the ideas are but

386
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:40,189
we're intercutting our own voices so I

387
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:43,278
need to really clearly understand let's

388
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,169
say if I don't know like I keep coming

389
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:47,009
back to the Rhino hunter but I I need to

390
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,370
actually understand

391
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:54,960
the history of Namibia's conservation

392
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:58,859
policy be able to talk about it in a in

393
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:04,680
an educated let alone compelling way so

394
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:06,209
it's really about you in the moment very

395
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,019
very critically listening to the person

396
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,269
and then quickly coming up with the

397
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,609
question that resolves the issue that

398
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,200
you're feeling yourself have which is

399
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:17,929
which i think is just a great skill to

400
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,970
have in general

401
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,940
yeah just like being a very very active

402
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,319
listener and it's also about like

403
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,539
knowing when you're bored like that

404
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,710
that's one thing that we're always

405
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,269
trying to do because we're trying to

406
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,600
make stuff that's interesting and fun

407
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:34,440
right like we're we're not going to put

408
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,129
something out if it's not interesting

409
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,250
and so it part of the job is to also

410
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,970
just know what I'm interested in what

411
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:48,890
I'm curious about what I find a modicum

412
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,269
of Wonder in and then to chase that and

413
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,340
it's through the act of very critical

414
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:55,950
listening and like deep critical

415
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:58,079
awareness of of my own emotional states

416
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,640
as I'm taking in information that I that

417
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,199
I'm able to then hone in on not only

418
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,200
what I don't understand but what I do

419
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:22,009
truly find interesting so yeah it's a

420
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:24,779
it's a deep act of listening to you and

421
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:32,309
you have multiple going to tell me how

422
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:34,619
you idea yeah so again it totally varies

423
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,409
but I'd say about like five to six

424
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:42,059
months is probably a decent average and

425
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:45,330
so we've got what like six to eight

426
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:47,009
producers on staff at the moment and a

427
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:50,490
typical story is gonna have two

428
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:54,509
producers on it sometimes more sometimes

429
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,519
less and so we're sort of always trying

430
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,379
to have three or four things at

431
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,779
different phases of the production

432
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,400
process so that when we put one episode

433
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,200
out it's not like we're starting back at

434
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,930
square one and having to do in two weeks

435
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,900
all this work but rather we've got a

436
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,029
piece that's like 50% or 60% of the way

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,920
sort of produced and then it becomes

438
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:16,769
like polishing at the end those last two

439
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:21,810
weeks that very rarely happens and we're

440
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:23,460
constantly sprinting to try to find the

441
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,629
next thing or sprinting to try to finish

442
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,039
the thing that needs to come out next

443
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,010
but yeah in a perfect world it's like

444
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,569
this machine that has different

445
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:35,099
different stories moving at different

446
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,519
paces through different forms of the

447
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,519
production process

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:21:03,360
but yeah it's a show most of the

449
00:20:39,809 --> 00:21:09,089
time kind of the integrity of what

450
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:12,929
whoever you're interviewing yes so there

451
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:14,669
are a couple I think when you down an

452
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:19,620
interview from 90 minutes to 20 minutes

453
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:23,360
there there's sort of two competing two

454
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,709
competing goals that you have one is to

455
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,569
preserve the character of the person as

456
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,610
much as possible and by that I don't

457
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:31,710
even necessarily mean what they said but

458
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:34,259
sort of how they said if they're giggles

459
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,240
they're the moments where they pause to

460
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,650
think if they're if like you as the

461
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,019
interviewer have a nice back-and-forth

462
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,240
of rapport with the person that's

463
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:43,319
important to capture and maintain and

464
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,490
then the other thing you're trying to do

465
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,259
is you're trying to cram in as much

466
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,990
information into those 20 minutes as

467
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:53,670
possible right there's many different

468
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:56,160
ideas as you can and it's a it's an

469
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,650
impossible balance in that you're always

470
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,000
gonna feel like stuff that you left on

471
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,170
the cutting room floor should have made

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,180
it into that little 20-minute cut but

473
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,620
the act of keeping them both both those

474
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,269
priorities in your head as you're moving

475
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,089
through the tape I think it's the best

476
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:13,740
way to approach it and how I do it is it

477
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,369
can 90-minute an interview I just listen

478
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,620
through it from

479
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:18,719
beginning to end the first time and I'm

480
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,899
literally cutting and pulling down the

481
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,029
moments I like very liberally so and

482
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,980
typically after my first passed through

483
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:27,889
a 90 minute interview I'll have about 40

484
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,410
minutes of tape that I pulled as my

485
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,900
favorite parts my favorite 40 minutes

486
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,029
and then from there what I do is I'll

487
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,430
sort of go through and listen through it

488
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:40,139
front to back again and start reordering

489
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,890
fills because what often happens in in

490
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,470
an interview is you're gonna have a lot

491
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,270
of the same ideas repeated throughout

492
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,679
different parts of the interview or even

493
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:58,019
in quick succession and so if I don't

494
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:59,400
know what what's an example here so I

495
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,460
was talking with these Content

496
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,070
moderators in the Philippines folks who

497
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,230
essentially it's their job to if you

498
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:09,240
flag something on facebook as

499
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,039
inappropriate it gets sent to Manila and

500
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,539
somebody sitting behind a computer then

501
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,279
has that image come across them and they

502
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,769
have to click yes is inappropriate or no

503
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,910
this is not inappropriate and so like

504
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:21,240
throughout the course my interview with

505
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,070
this guy I like came at him four times

506
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,870
with essentially variations of the same

507
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,639
question like wait so what does it look

508
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,139
like in your office like I'm trying to

509
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,690
actually imagine when you're sitting at

510
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,130
your computer what this looks like so

511
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,170
throughout the 90 minutes that's that

512
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,730
question is speckled through after I

513
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,679
pulled the 40 minutes of tape down I

514
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,480
started rearranging things so I have

515
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,059
like okay here are my four takes of the

516
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,980
guy answering this question maybe the

517
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,359
four it takes add up to a total of four

518
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,190
minutes long but he kind of says the

519
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,219
same thing each time I'm gonna be able

520
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,019
to cut that down to a minute or a minute

521
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,009
and a half sort of scrambling together

522
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,569
the best versions of him explaining that

523
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,579
and so after going through in a second

524
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,678
time you've reordered things then you

525
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,359
just start hacking stuff down and you

526
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,610
can usually get it down to 20 minutes

527
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:11,009
like it's sort of amazing in a 90 minute

528
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:12,449
conversation yeah you don't list off

529
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:14,519
times you don't actually need that much

530
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,259
more than 20 minutes to get the mate and

531
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,410
like the majority of the substance of

532
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,519
the conversation I hope that's not true

533
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,980
with what I'm saying right now I'm

534
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,210
hoping if they got down it would be hard

535
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,750
to get it down to 20 minutes but

536
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,750
partners

537
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,250
yes Oh like the reporting process or

538
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,849
like the ideation like how do we come up

539
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:56,279
with wit stories is that the question

540
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:57,899
okay yeah it's really hard because

541
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,849
they're like for something to work as a

542
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,730
radio lab story and this isn't true of

543
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,869
all podcast documentary programs but

544
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,670
like it there are a certain number of

545
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,500
boxes that need to be checked like you

546
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,610
got to have a character you have to have

547
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,549
a character that had something

548
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:13,799
interesting happened to them and then

549
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,460
that interesting unexpected thing that

550
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,409
happened to them

551
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,880
has to lead to some unexpected

552
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:24,269
interesting consequence so like that's

553
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,950
box one and that sort of near the the

554
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,210
building blocks or the foundation of the

555
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,680
narrative tension that I talked about

556
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,120
before it like you need to have

557
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,680
something happen that causes something

558
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,739
to make you give a damn about whatever

559
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,330
the hell this person has experienced on

560
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,349
top of that then like they have to be

561
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:39,059
able to tell their story in an

562
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,279
interesting ways so that you feel like

563
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,919
you can emotionally engage with them and

564
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,960
then on top of that like there has to be

565
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,279
as I said before like a question that

566
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,529
you're exploring and you need to have

567
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,299
like you you need or I need to be able

568
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:53,250
to articulate very clearly like I want

569
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:59,579
to do this story because I'm curious

570
00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:00,930
about buppa buppa buckin a pro ch trying

571
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,949
to check all those boxes or finding

572
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,990
something that checks out those boxes

573
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,549
one is I come up with a question on my

574
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,630
own that I'm like oh I'm really curious

575
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:12,500
about like content moderation I was like

576
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:17,370
why is it such a hard problem to solve

577
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,539
the misinformation the rampant

578
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,069
misinformation on these social media

579
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,849
platforms why is that such a hard

580
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:25,049
problem to solve and that led me to go

581
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:27,149
find a bunch of people who are thinking

582
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,440
about this and doing this and and are

583
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,850
trying to solve it and could explain it

584
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,980
to me and through that I bumped into

585
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,659
people that have a story like the one I

586
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,160
mentioned before that something strange

587
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,500
happens to them and then they do

588
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,389
something strange in return the other

589
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,808
way is you just

590
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:45,548
like you just you can start with a

591
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:47,859
character like you find somebody who's

592
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:49,990
interesting like the the piece I did

593
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:51,939
about the city councilman like a year

594
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,528
before I even started reporting that

595
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,880
piece I reached out to the guy because I

596
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,730
had read an article about him and I

597
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,409
thought he was interesting and we like

598
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,870
would get coffee every couple months and

599
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,278
then from there as your report once I

600
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,750
started reporting out the story it's

601
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,058
figuring out what is the question that

602
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm actually exploring through this but

603
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:12,579
Ness ins like I and its most basic is

604
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,909
just about input like you have to be

605
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:19,509
reading a lot you have to be talking to

606
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:21,009
a lot of people you have to be just sort

607
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:23,009
of a where you're like you're trying to

608
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:28,360
soak up as much of the world as you can

609
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:30,730
to then be able to figure out or feel

610
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:33,000
what in all of that mess is the most

611
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,259
interesting or the most confusing to you

612
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,419
but like if I'm if I have a day where

613
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:39,639
I'm just reporting and by reporting I

614
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:41,679
mean like looking for a story if I'm if

615
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,028
I'm hunting for stories I have just have

616
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,700
sort of a checklist that I go through

617
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,589
like I need to read five articles I need

618
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,710
to make two phone calls and I need to

619
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:53,648
schedule two more phone calls and if I

620
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,028
do that it becomes a numbers game and if

621
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:56,378
I do that enough days in a row I know

622
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:59,109
I'm eventually going to stumble into

623
00:27:56,378 --> 00:28:02,548
something that gets me excited but it's

624
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,548
really hard it's really really hard

625
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,669
[Music]

626
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,589
sorry do you mind

627
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,668
sorry I don't mean interrupt but can you

628
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:33,788
talk a little bit louder I can't quite

629
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:35,620
hear you yeah sorry the question is like

630
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:38,079
how do you how you get people to agree

631
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:38,949
to talk and then how do you sort of make

632
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,298
them comfortable throughout the

633
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,038
interviewing process to talk about the

634
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:47,980
things that you want to talk about yeah

635
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:50,679
okay yeah it's weird it's a it totally

636
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,890
depends it depends on who they are it

637
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,210
depends on what their

638
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,410
why they're feeling ambivalent about

639
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,490
whether they want to talk to you or not

640
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:05,950
in the first place and then for me it's

641
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:09,069
it's about getting out in front of those

642
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:11,049
concerns that they have and to a degree

643
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:13,480
convincing them in a way that is

644
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,759
slightly manipulated but not maliciously

645
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,690
manipulative that they should talk to

646
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:22,539
you so for example there's this guy Judd

647
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,850
Hoffman who was Facebook's head of

648
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:27,339
global policy he was the guy who

649
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:30,099
essentially wrote the rulebook for what

650
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:32,319
is allowed to be on Facebook guy with a

651
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,059
ton of power guy with the story that I

652
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,289
think's fascinating and that I haven't

653
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,539
heard many people talk about like this

654
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,099
is the guy I want to get and we have

655
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:40,809
this wonderful phone call together like

656
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:42,639
I don't even bring up the possibility of

657
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,779
talking on the record and then at the

658
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,100
end of this hour and a half on the phone

659
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,839
I'm like so by the way would you be

660
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,059
comfortable talking on the record like

661
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,569
to be sort of have this conversation

662
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,359
again

663
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:53,289
but record it and he says like I don't

664
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,609
know if I'm gonna be able to do that

665
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:58,509
like I've really enjoyed this

666
00:29:54,609 --> 00:30:00,579
conversation I'm just like I'm worried

667
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:02,619
that I'm gonna look like on Monday

668
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:04,599
morning quarterbacking here if I talk

669
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,129
about what Facebook's doing and more

670
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,469
than that like the company I work for

671
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,870
now and he worked for Pinterest he was

672
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,640
worried that they are going to like he

673
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:16,509
doesn't want what he says about Facebook

674
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,220
to in any way hurt Pinterest and so what

675
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:20,890
I did was I'm like I totally understand

676
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,120
that if nothing else can we just plan to

677
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,500
talk again because I'm sure I'll have

678
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,359
more questions off the record and he

679
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,180
said sure get shoot me an email with

680
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,889
some times to talk and so then when I do

681
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,470
is I spend like two and a half hours

682
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,600
crafting an email where in the first

683
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,029
paragraph I set up I propose some time

684
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,809
to talk but then like the real heart of

685
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:42,579
it is like this is I'm pitching him on

686
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:44,470
why he should go on the record and I'm

687
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,629
addressing point by point the issues

688
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,440
that he had when not wanting to do so

689
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:54,040
and obviously doing so in a in a

690
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,450
transparent way like and like winking at

691
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,299
the fact that I'm pitching you on this

692
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,680
and I know that you know that I'm trying

693
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:03,099
to get you to do something you don't

694
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,900
want to do but really just leveling with

695
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:05,919
them and I guess when I'm trying to get

696
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,650
people to talk on the record

697
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:13,690
in general I'm trying to use

698
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:18,040
transparency and authenticity as a tool

699
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:20,980
to get people to talk which is sort of

700
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:22,450
an odd thing because it's not

701
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,839
particularly authentic to use

702
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:31,870
authenticity in a calculated way but it

703
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:33,159
works and then as to like being on the

704
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:36,039
record with someone it's this weird

705
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,230
active sort of feeling it out at the

706
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,549
moment because the things that the

707
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,170
people don't that people don't want to

708
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,909
talk about are typically the things that

709
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,080
are the most interesting so it becomes

710
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,180
this game of you like walk the

711
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,649
conversation closer and closer to

712
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,750
whatever the question is that you really

713
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,430
want to ask and then you feel them sort

714
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,960
of bristle so you back up and you move

715
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,990
somewhere else but then again you push

716
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,180
back on it and then in the last 20% of

717
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,950
the interview is like hopefully you've

718
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,150
warmed them up to the idea of talking

719
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,410
about this hopefully they trust you a

720
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:06,070
bit at that point hopefully you are

721
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,450
trustworthy at that point and yeah you

722
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:29,470
just got to sort of hit him with the

723
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:32,830
question that really relates to me when

724
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:35,200
when you say that do you mean yeah I

725
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:37,389
guess I can you clarify the question a

726
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,150
little bit like like one that resonated

727
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:53,259
emotionally with me or yeah what exactly

728
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:56,820
what exactly do you mean yeah well I

729
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:59,799
guess what what I'm lucky in that my job

730
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:02,289
like every story I go after is because

731
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:05,379
I'm actually curious about some aspect

732
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:07,299
of it and occasionally I'll have to help

733
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,770
produce a story for someone else that

734
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,930
I'm not all that interested in but I

735
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:17,289
think every story I've certainly every

736
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:18,700
story I have I've reported what it was

737
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:21,339
was personally people in some way

738
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:28,150
because I just got to learn a lot and

739
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:29,769
satisfy a genuine curiosity recently I

740
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,519
did a story that I got to do with my dad

741
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:36,670
which was really fun so like that just

742
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,529
on a very personal level was very it was

743
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:43,630
very sad dying and it was just cool to

744
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:46,930
hear his voice on the radio but yeah I

745
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,120
think like hopefully and like whatever

746
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,920
field you all end up going into like

747
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,000
hopefully whatever you're doing does

748
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,470
satisfy you

749
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,029
both intellectually and emotionally

750
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,440
hopefully on like a regular basis I

751
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,569
think that's what everybody should be

752
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:29,619
striving for and I I I'm very lucky in

753
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:41,230
that my job does that for me so how do

754
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:42,819
you guys yeah interesting question I'm

755
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:49,690
trying to figure out how honest to be

756
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:51,419
here yeah maybe even that question was

757
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:56,590
planned by me to make you trust me more

758
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:58,719
I it's really I'll say two ends of the

759
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,600
spectrum here right one end of the

760
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:06,809
spectrum is we do have an audience and

761
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:10,329
it is reliably college educated and

762
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:13,420
reliably liberal or at least skews

763
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:15,929
Democratic we know that about our

764
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,579
audience we know what they want to hear

765
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:23,589
and we know sort of how far we can push

766
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:25,000
them so we're sort of always keeping

767
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,990
that in mind like we want to challenge

768
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,639
the audience with reason because we

769
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:34,239
challenge them too much

770
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:36,608
there can be backlash nobody's happy we

771
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,139
come off sounding tone-deaf so there's

772
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:41,230
that calculation being made of like we

773
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:43,210
got we got a we can't do too much here

774
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,369
but at the same time there's sort of the

775
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,079
Miles Davis approach which when Miles

776
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:49,720
Davis in his later years would play like

777
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,130
he'd go up on stage and he would instead

778
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:52,480
of having a microphone in front of him

779
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,220
looking out at the audience that he'd

780
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,068
play into he'd have a microphone like on

781
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:59,318
the ground at the back of the stage and

782
00:35:57,068 --> 00:36:01,000
he'd just turned his audience never

783
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,699
turned his back to the audience and play

784
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,099
into his microphone sort of saying

785
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:08,679
you I'm gonna do my thing if you want to

786
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:12,338
listen to it you can't and so there's

787
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:14,798
like there's a there's like a swagger to

788
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:19,808
that and there's a confidence that like

789
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:25,088
what I find interesting will be

790
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:26,410
interesting to people that clearly if

791
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,818
you do that too much you're gonna come

792
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,808
across as an and you probably

793
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,690
are an

794
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:33,250
but uh like there there's a degree of

795
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,500
that that needs to that needs to be

796
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,119
inside of you as well when we're when

797
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:43,170
you're figuring out what it is you want

798
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:45,670
to spend six months of your life so like

799
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,220
sort of love the audience but forget

800
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:52,150
about the audience I think is one way we

801
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:54,219
think about it I don't know if that's

802
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,358
applicable to what you all do to push

803
00:36:54,219 --> 00:37:29,798
back on me if you think I'm totally

804
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:31,088
wrong yeah yeah yeah I think I'll sort

805
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:33,639
of go back to one of my earlier answers

806
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:36,818
and just say like I think it's being

807
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:38,828
able there's a confidence in being able

808
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:42,009
to be stupid in front of very smart

809
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:43,750
people and to be able to be stupid in a

810
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,490
very smart way

811
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,230
to know when they're not quite

812
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:49,089
articulating their themselves well

813
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,889
enough for the average person to be able

814
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,420
to hear and for you to be able to jump

815
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,589
in and say like whoa I'm sorry I didn't

816
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,599
quite understand that are you saying it

817
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,530
this way or is this what you mean or is

818
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,059
this what you mean because I'm not quite

819
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:03,850
sure and that again is a is a can only

820
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:06,759
happen when once you've really developed

821
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:27,789
an ability to listen critically so being

822
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:33,700
at being a critical listener yeah are

823
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:37,960
you actually kind of know they kind of

824
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:46,089
say but trying and when you do that have

825
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:47,400
you I guess not come across as fake yeah

826
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,320
good question

827
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,809
I'm totally playing them like I don't

828
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,010
know if I Drive I don't know if I would

829
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:58,659
use the term playing devil's advocate

830
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:03,820
but but certainly I'm making arguments

831
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:05,859
that I don't agree with at times to push

832
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,280
someone to more clearly articulate their

833
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:11,380
argument or I'm even oftimes I'm playing

834
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,180
dumb when I understand something or it's

835
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,890
as straight it's as small a thing is

836
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:16,719
like well I'm saying something like I

837
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:19,089
hear that they bumped the microphone I

838
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,349
might say like sorry I didn't quite

839
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,410
understand that could you say that again

840
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:26,049
just so we have like a clear piece of

841
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:27,519
tape of them saying it and as far as

842
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,240
like doing it in a way that doesn't feel

843
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,980
over the top or performed like I think

844
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,739
at least for me like I I approach

845
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,599
interviewing as a sort of active

846
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:41,049
performance like I am a different person

847
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:44,739
when I'm interviewing than I am in the

848
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:46,660
rest of my life I don't think I'm a it's

849
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,549
a version of myself like it's a slightly

850
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:52,799
more heightened version more excited

851
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,800
version or more easily excited person

852
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,670
and and as far as like do I know what

853
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,460
they're going to say when I enter

854
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:03,099
the room I all off times have a good

855
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,900
idea and if I do then that gives me some

856
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:10,809
lead time and prior to the interview to

857
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:13,710
to sort of prepare a list of counter

858
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:15,760
arguments for what I expect them to say

859
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,190
but at the same time like you know any

860
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,839
at least the ethos here is you don't

861
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,490
want to prep too much because you want

862
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,900
to be able to have an actual genuine

863
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:24,729
back-and-forth with the person and be

864
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,490
present and allow yourself to think

865
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:33,099
through something with them in any given

866
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:34,539
moment so yeah it's it's a I think it's

867
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,750
something you can only learn by doing

868
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,230
and sort of dialing dialing yourself in

869
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,000
and how how you want to be in that space

870
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,719
which is a totally unsatisfactory answer

871
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,719
and I'm sorry about that

872
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:55,088
even just popped in with a question that

873
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:59,588
they wanted to ask elaborate on training

874
00:40:55,088 --> 00:41:01,328
specifically yeah the question is like

875
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:05,078
how did I how did I learn how to do some

876
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:09,730
of this stuff like particularly critical

877
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:11,950
listening and okay so I didn't I didn't

878
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:17,530
study journalism I have no background in

879
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:19,389
it I when I was 20 22 I was living down

880
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,359
in South America

881
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:25,828
working at a couple restaurants just

882
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:27,969
trying to master the Spanish language

883
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:29,109
and while I was doing that I realized

884
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:31,689
like what the hell am I going to do with

885
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:33,190
my life and felt like you know I like to

886
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,349
write I listen to a lot of public radio

887
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,769
I had played in bands so I understood

888
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:41,650
audio to a degree and so I decided like

889
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:43,989
well let's move somewhere new in Latin

890
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,119
America and just try being a reporter

891
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:47,529
for the freelance reporter and I knew

892
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:49,780
that there were interesting things going

893
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,339
on in Venezuela and that nobody are very

894
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,670
few english-speaking reporters were

895
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:58,389
there so I moved to Venezuela and just

896
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,099
started pitching places like going out

897
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:02,769
trying to find stories pitching those

898
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:06,010
story ideas to different editors until I

899
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:10,239
eventually got picked up by the BBC's

900
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,440
the world and from there I moved to

901
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,169
Ireland I did that again

902
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,250
and working for an English speaking

903
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:20,670
German radio show and then from there I

904
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:24,570
got I got an internship here at the show

905
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:26,590
so like what can be learned from that I

906
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,730
think the most important thing is just

907
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:33,309
to stuff like if you if and not not that

908
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,860
you all want to be journalists but just

909
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:37,210
like you just have to start making stuff

910
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,190
you just have to start doing stuff and

911
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,289
don't wait for somebody to don't wait to

912
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,179
get permission don't necessarily wait to

913
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:45,489
have all of the skills before you start

914
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:47,739
just you're gonna learn stuff as you're

915
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:51,159
probably gonna learn things more quickly

916
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:53,019
potentially by just doing them so

917
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:56,799
there's that aspect of it I will say I

918
00:42:53,019 --> 00:43:02,409
showed up to the show here and was

919
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:04,930
totally like out of my depth like and I

920
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:07,119
mean that in not just a journalistic way

921
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:08,679
but like I grew up in Wisconsin I didn't

922
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,299
get a great education I went to a state

923
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,190
school in Oregon for college and

924
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:16,480
suddenly I'm with all these Ivy League

925
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:19,059
who think super fast and and

926
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,199
are just way better read than me and so

927
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:25,000
it was like this three years of just

928
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,869
educating myself so that I could even

929
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,179
have conversations with people and so

930
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:35,799
again like there was a lot of self

931
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:40,059
education there and I was surrounded by

932
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,820
really as you all clearly are really

933
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:46,779
smart thoughtful people who were patient

934
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,910
with me and helped me along the way so

935
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,540
yeah I think they're all very learnable

936
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:53,710
skills I don't think there's any sort of

937
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,230
yeah I don't know if there's an innate

938
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,030
miss to it at all the only other one one

939
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:00,309
thing I will say is I think the way I

940
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:03,040
learned and I didn't even know I was

941
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:04,449
learning to be an interviewer but the

942
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,610
way I learned how the interview was like

943
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:08,019
I hitchhiked a bunch in college and when

944
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,340
you're hitchhiking like you're just

945
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,989
sitting in the passenger seat and you

946
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,840
have nothing to do but talk to the

947
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:15,459
person and they're giving you arrived so

948
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,870
to a degree I felt sort of indebted to

949
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,000
them and the way I would pay them back

950
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:22,440
was by asking them questions about like

951
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,820
who they are what they were up to and

952
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,829
I think I honed that skill in those long

953
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:36,710
car rides I don't know if I suggest that

954
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:39,269
people do that or not but it works okay

955
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,980
yeah really really do you have any

956
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:42,989
stories like Chris was saying that

957
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,460
really failures or flops that like you

958
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:52,009
know he was like across earth there was

959
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:56,010
background or anything like that oh yeah

960
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,900
yeah I know the biggest one was this

961
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,950
episode that we put out called truth

962
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:05,670
trolls which got pulled down which we

963
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:11,129
ended up retracting and essentially it

964
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:12,720
was the story of 4chan trolling Shia

965
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:17,000
LaBeouf and this art project he was

966
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:20,459
doing and how through incredible wit

967
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,639
perseverance and critical thought they

968
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:26,820
were able to locate where this where

969
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:30,900
this flag was located knowing nothing

970
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:33,720
more than a live stream video of the

971
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,059
flag and it's an incredible story like

972
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,949
it in and of itself the fact that these

973
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:39,500
guys managed to pull this off I think is

974
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:47,279
it's incredible

975
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:50,130
now clearly where we failed was that we

976
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,030
didn't articulate clearly enough that

977
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:58,710
there are a lot of bad actors on fortune

978
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:00,330
and that it's even possible that some of

979
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:06,300
the guys who ended up doing this were

980
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:09,210
those bad actors and so for that reason

981
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,990
and also in part because the episode

982
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,510
came out like the day before

983
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:13,979
Charlottesville so suddenly the national

984
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,890
conversation and just the national mood

985
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,380
changed in this very dark way and

986
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:23,460
rightfully so it just it even fell to us

987
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,740
that what we had done was tone-deaf what

988
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,010
I what I think was important about that

989
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:31,469
piece and what I can you Inc to strive

990
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,140
to do despite in this this sort of comes

991
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:36,039
with the pushing the audience is like I

992
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:41,230
think that

993
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:45,250
what a court bad people can still have

994
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:49,840
rich complicated interesting lives and

995
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:52,800
that just because like III think you can

996
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,350
you can present someone's story without

997
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,300
glorifying the horrible views that they

998
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:00,130
might have and that's a really hard

999
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,510
thing because like there's always gonna

1000
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,010
be a good portion of the audience who

1001
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,490
thinks like you just shouldn't even give

1002
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:08,320
this person a platform which like I'm

1003
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:12,039
happy to have that argument and I think

1004
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,240
you whoever someone who is articulate

1005
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:15,369
that like they're they have plenty of

1006
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:17,919
good arguments they could use but I

1007
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,109
guess my like a principal I have is like

1008
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,369
it's better to see other people as human

1009
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:28,210
than not and if I can find a an iota of

1010
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:30,039
entity and someone it's not only worth

1011
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:34,119
presenting but I think it's also just

1012
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:36,849
deeply interesting but yeah that was one

1013
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:40,299
that we we missed the mark on in several

1014
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:49,179
ways and we acknowledged yeah we

1015
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:56,620
up so first up thank you very much for

1016
00:47:49,179 --> 00:48:00,009
taking the time so yeah this was super

1017
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:01,299
interesting and I'll send you a

1018
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,850
follow-up email I guess I got to get

1019
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,690
some paper permission to post the

1020
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:09,130
recording Cornell policy stuff but yeah

1021
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,990
no this is this is awesome thank you

1022
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:17,190
very much well and I I don't think all

1023
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:17,189
Ivy Leaguers are alright
