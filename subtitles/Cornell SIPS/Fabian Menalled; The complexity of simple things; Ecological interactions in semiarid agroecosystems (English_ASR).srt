1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,960
University thank you thank you very much

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:16,118
for the introduction and also thanks a

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,000
lot for hosting me uh during this uh

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,198
semester and I'm really can you hear me

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,759
in the back yeah if you cannot hear me

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,800
if I'm losing my vot just you know raise

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,640
your hand wait me um I'm I'm really

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,039
excited about uh this presentation

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,280
because will allow me to share with you

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:38,519
some of the research uh that I've been

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,760
doing for the last 10 12 years or so

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,120
okay so I will be probably jumping from

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,399
one topic to the next one highlighting

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,839
some results um and sort of closing over

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,558
the methods if you want me to go into

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,440
more details on the things that we did

18
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,959
and the results just let me know and I

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,358
will be more than happy to meet with you

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,480
after this presentation now when I said

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:07,000
uh re research that I've been doing uh

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:10,359
for the last 10 or 12 years actually I'm

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,959
saying research that was done by my

24
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,640
great grad students and post talks and

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,239
also in collaboration with many

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,478
colleagues here at Montana State

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,839
University and all of us we need to

28
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:28,680
thank the many many many undergrads uh

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,520
that help us every day so I think it

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,920
good uh place to start this presentation

31
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,759
is by looking at this paper that was

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,879
published a few years ago um and

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,118
basically what they did is they

34
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:48,679
summarized 89 studies that uh basically

35
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,759
came from almost, 1500 individual case

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,840
studies uh where they have uh checked

37
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,840
the landscape complexity around those

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,920
1500 uh places and uh check the um

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,520
abundance and diversity of beneficial

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,679
organisms they focus on pollinators and

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,199
natural enemies and they check the um

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,239
functioning and the services they obtain

43
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:18,439
from those ecosystems and and sure

44
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:23,120
enough um as you see here as you

45
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:25,959
increase the abundance of both uh

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,759
pollinators or natural enemies they saw

47
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,319
an increase in the pollination or the

48
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:35,000
past management

49
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:38,799
and then one other thing they did is

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,080
through a couple of path analysis they

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
assessed the relationship between the

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,800
landscape complexity those beneficial

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,440
organisms and the services in that

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:55,439
particular case was yield and of course

55
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:57,878
as we um decrease the landscape uh

56
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,519
complexity of the system as we simplify

57
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,518
the system we see a negative impact

58
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:08,319
on the abundance and diversity of those

59
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,439
beneficial organisms and uh the relation

60
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,280
positive relationship between those

61
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,479
beneficial organisms and yield now one

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,239
thing that I uh notice from these

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,598
studies and you probably noed as well is

64
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,280
that the great although they came from

65
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:26,560
around the world the great majority of

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,479
them came from Europe and from here the

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,280
Northeast part of the United States now

68
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:38,318
I come from Montana uh which is part of

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,280
the uh great plain region and that's uh

70
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,199
probably one of the leading uh regions

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,280
in the world in production of uh small

72
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:51,479
grains uh wheat barley pools crops and

73
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,199
forage crops and old seed crops and

74
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:58,119
however there were no studies uh that

75
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:03,039
were conducted there so if you've been

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,920
in Montana um outside bosan Yellowstone

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,318
Big Sky you know the touristic area you

78
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,878
probably know that it looks more or less

79
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,878
something like this I think it's one of

80
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:16,798
the most simplified systems that can

81
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,839
imagine um because we have across the

82
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,439
state it varies but we have regions uh

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,638
where precipitation can be around um 9

84
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:30,519
to 11 Ines of precipitation per year a

85
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,400
farmers like to leave 50% of their land

86
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:37,359
in follow to basically accumulate

87
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:40,879
moisture however in the last 20 years or

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,919
so there been quite a big push towards

89
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,439
diversifying the cropping systems and

90
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:50,120
including pool crops All Seal crops but

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,959
still that's the landscape that dominate

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,280
uh these systems and when I arrived to

93
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,599
Montana in 2004 I quickly learned that

94
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,279
teich is not really a good option there

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,320
here uh because if we have three month

96
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:10,000
without rains and uh 90 95 degrees and

97
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:14,560
really strong winds you will lose the

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,879
soil due to erosion so a farmers uh

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,319
basically have a known till follows

100
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:24,719
which means repeated applications of

101
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,639
glyphosate and during the crop year um

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,240
it's a little bit more complex we can

103
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,879
say they have a series of herbicides

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,319
they can choose from depending on which

105
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:40,719
species they have uh however they come

106
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,199
from two families group one and group

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,240
two Acca and ALS Inhibitors

108
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:52,400
herbines so when I learned about this I

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,360
sort of thought this was the most boring

110
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,679
place to do research I thought there was

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,000
nothing nothing to really of motivate

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,720
myself it was like like I'm sitting here

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,360
in

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,360
this really simple system except that if

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,038
you look carefully you really notice

116
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,160
that ecosystems are not equal there are

117
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,079
differences in the ecosystems and we

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,280
start working with um my uh first grad

119
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:24,318
student F Pak in assessing the community

120
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,359
we communities um in organic and

121
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,280
conventional systems much to my surprise

122
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,199
um no study have even working with

123
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:38,159
communities in that

124
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:41,319
region and uh sure enough sort of a

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,360
similar to what has been found uh in

126
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:48,160
other places um in organic systems you

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,199
have a different community of weeds um

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,599
more diverse more

129
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,960
abundance so the next question um we

130
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,000
asked was so what could this be having

131
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,279
an impact on those on beneficial

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,079
organism

133
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:07,758
and we work on parasitoids as well as

134
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,758
pollinators but for the next 10 or 15

135
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,400
minutes I will be talking about

136
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,479
pollinators now you may be asking me

137
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:21,038
what why do we care about pollinators in

138
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,240
a system that is dominated by wheat and

139
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,639
phow right well the reason is like I

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,840
said there's a huge interest in

141
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,598
diversifying this cropping system

142
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,679
there's a lot of of course ergonomic

143
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,240
benefits for that but also there's a lot

144
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,759
of money I mean lentil uh Montana is the

145
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,879
number one uh producer of organic uh

146
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,120
lenal so there's a lot of money come

147
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:49,039
with these crops and we also have many

148
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Native species that require uh

149
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:56,680
pollinators now um assessing pollinators

150
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,280
in this really extremely large field was

151
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,840
a was a challenging task and I was very

152
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:08,519
lucky uh to be able to recruit uh

153
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,478
subari uh who was my uh PhD student then

154
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,478
stay as a post dog he's now in the

155
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,639
University of Idaho and he wanted to um

156
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,918
check the abundance and diversity of

157
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,639
pollinators he focus on be in this

158
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,478
system and again to the best of my my

159
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,879
knowledge no study has addressed

160
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,240
pollination pollinators across in these

161
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,038
AG Ultra systems across the whole

162
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,360
Northern Great plain region we couldn't

163
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,598
find any

164
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,240
information so what subot did is uh he

165
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,320
went to the north part north central

166
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,600
part of Montana what it's called the

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,720
Golden Triangle where the uh with

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,759
production is concentrated and for three

169
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,600
years he selected three organic and

170
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,278
three conventional

171
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,800
fields

172
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:04,078
and to show you how uh simplify these

173
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:07,359
Landscapes are uh he basically

174
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:10,838
Quantified the different systems or or

175
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,440
ecosystem they have in radius of 250 up

176
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,200
to 2 kilometers and if you move 2

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,880
kilometers from the fields you still

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,480
have close to 80% of crop Fields there's

179
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:26,000
really nothing except wheat or crops

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,278
basically and barley organic farmers

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,958
tend to have more more Diversified

182
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,039
rotation

183
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,799
so his

184
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:39,679
um

185
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:42,919
hypothesis was that if you have um more

186
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:47,000
abundance and diversity of forms in the

187
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:50,039
organic uh systems then uh you should

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,440
have healthier pollinators and that

189
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:56,679
could be assessed at the um individual

190
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,440
level and at the colony

191
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,439
level and that's what it saying so you

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
will have larger individuals and more

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
successful colonies in the organic

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
versus the conventional

195
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,879
Fields so what subot did is in each one

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,879
of these fields at least 250 Metter from

197
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,480
any border so in the middle of a crop

198
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,879
Fields he established

199
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,879
transects where he put five of these

200
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:27,000
bumblebees colonies uh we waigh the

201
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,639
colonies before um putting them in the

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,639
field we left them there for two month

203
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,759
and a half and

204
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,679
then we uh retrieve them and desect the

205
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,838
colonies back in the

206
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:46,199
lab he then check for the health of the

207
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,079
individual be by checking the lipid

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,879
content the idea is that the Beast don't

209
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,239
fly a lot they won't be investing much

210
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,000
energy in flying and therefore they will

211
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,759
be able to accumulate more lipids but

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,759
also if they fly less they're WI will be

213
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,278
more intact so he also checked for the

214
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,679
how intact were the wing

215
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,078
markings and he also check for the

216
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,958
pollen uh that were found in the bodies

217
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,319
of those bees they idea that because he

218
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,199
also sampled the

219
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,639
vegetation he then could be able to more

220
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,560
or less infer where those bees were

221
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,919
foraging from

222
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:30,000
okay and then he dissected the colonies

223
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,719
and check for the number of reprodu self

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and the number of cells with Nectars and

225
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:41,079
also the number of males and

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,919
workers so um one of the uh first result

227
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:47,319
in terms of the pollen coming from the

228
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,199
bees um he noticed that there were no

229
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,800
difference between this is just one year

230
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,120
and the next year uh there were no

231
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,759
differences in the pollen that was

232
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,919
collected from B coming from the organic

233
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,078
and conventional fields that is sort of

234
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,958
suggesting that they're actually flying

235
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:12,638
all around the landscape and the most

236
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:15,838
abundant po came from alala okay so

237
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,759
again suggesting that they fly find the

238
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,880
alala and then they may by come back to

239
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:25,120
the uh

240
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,159
colonies and probably because of that um

241
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,240
there's more weeds in the organic

242
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:35,240
fields and there was a lot of volun as

243
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,240
well um those bees have um individual in

244
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,720
bees were able to accumulate more lipids

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,000
in their bodies and their wings uh or

246
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,278
more intact so again that's telling us

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,320
that they have their food oh suggesting

248
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,120
that the food uh of the sources for

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,040
pollen and nectar are closer to the

250
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,399
colonies than in the conventional Fields

251
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,519
they have to fly you know a couple of

252
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,879
kilometers to find those

253
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:07,039
plants then uh when he look at the uh

254
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:10,320
relative growth uh growth rate of the

255
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,639
colony it was larger uh in the organic

256
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,399
Fields versus the conventional fields

257
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,959
and when he look at the number of

258
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,120
reproductive cells as well as cells with

259
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:23,879
a nectar he found more cells in the

260
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,560
organic fields on be on on colonies that

261
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,000
came from organic Fields than the

262
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,119
conventional

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,078
fields and overall the was a positive

264
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,320
relationship uh between the flower

265
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,638
density or the species richness and the

266
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,000
growth rate for both years that he

267
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,198
conducted this

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,519
study and the number of reproductive

269
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,559
cells as well as the number of uh nectar

270
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,639
uh

271
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:56,518
cells so the next step he did was to

272
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,519
sayess what is a relationship I mean so

273
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,480
we have healthier individuals was that

274
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,639
this translate into healthier

275
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,879
communities of

276
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,159
peace and his idea was that again less

277
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:15,360
Poland sources in the or in the

278
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:18,958
conventional Fields should translate in

279
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,639
uh less abundant less diverse uh big

280
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:25,399
communities and because of that the

281
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,399
networks uh between flowers and

282
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:33,278
pollinators should be weaker in the uh

283
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,559
conventional Fields versus the organic

284
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:40,360
Fields so uh one of the things he did

285
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,638
was to establish these pollen traps so

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,360
he was trapping pollinators in all these

287
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,198
fields you can see this is a pretty Wy

288
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,959
field that's one of the organic fields

289
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,838
and

290
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:56,879
then again he assessed the Forbes

291
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,480
abundance and richness and he spent

292
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,320
hours and hours just walking in along

293
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,199
transect and then checking if one

294
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,399
individual be will land on the flower

295
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:14,198
and iing the bee and the

296
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:16,919
flower and uh one of the things that uh

297
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,559
he found is that there were no

298
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,198
differences in the communities of uh

299
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,399
bees between organic and conventional

300
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,838
Fields again shows it suggests that they

301
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,159
are all flying around the landscape what

302
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:35,160
he saw was a uh a shift in big

303
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,439
communities within the growing season

304
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:41,719
but no difference across the systems but

305
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,959
the difference difference came in the

306
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,920
networks when he look at the uh number

307
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,799
of times uh a bee landed on a flower in

308
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,719
a conventional field there are very few

309
00:15:50,799 --> 00:16:00,000
flowers and the only he only found three

310
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,199
species and uh six pollinators okay and

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,919
that was

312
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,758
significantly uh weaker that the network

313
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,519
that he observed in the conventional

314
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,120
Fields um now remember that I said that

315
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,318
the most abundant pollen You observe in

316
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,480
the Bumble Beast was Alfalfa and it

317
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:24,360
happened that Alfalfa is the main source

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,360
of a uh or the main place where the

319
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,560
those pce landed in the convention field

320
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,120
we can think that the farmer will be

321
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,958
successful in killing all the volunteer

322
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,959
Alfalfa and if that happens then if he

323
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,958
gets R of the alala and if we think of a

324
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,518
landscape where there's no organic

325
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,679
Fields basically 80% of the pollinators

326
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,679
will

327
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:53,479
disappear however in the organic system

328
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,439
if for whatever reason we don't have

329
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,639
more volunteer Al Alpha which is going

330
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,680
to be a little bit more difficult

331
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
because Farmers you know organ IC

332
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:04,838
Farmers don't have access to those

333
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,359
selective herbicides um still every

334
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,399
single pollinator will be able to find a

335
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,318
source of poen nectar in another

336
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,759
species so in

337
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:21,078
summary what subot was uh seeing is that

338
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:24,400
the enhanced fluid resources uh That You

339
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:27,240
observe in our organic system

340
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,480
um correlates with an increase in the

341
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,798
individual and a colony colony success

342
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,038
and also we have more stable pollinator

343
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,960
flower networks in the organic system

344
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:44,679
versus the conventional

345
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,440
system so we start thinking well is that

346
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,720
the idea again that if you lose the

347
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,480
alala you lose the pollinators is that

348
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,079
saying that the organic systems are more

349
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,798
resilient than the conventional systems

350
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,199
and you know there's there's many many

351
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,599
many ways by which you can assess

352
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,840
resiliency in a system I'm going to just

353
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:11,519
show you one of the things that we did

354
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:16,439
okay and basically this was done at this

355
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:21,679
side um which is located I think four

356
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:26,000
miles uh out of bman um basically what

357
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,679
we had there uh is a fiveyear rotation

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,038
first we started with safflower inter

359
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,440
with Clover that stayed for the next

360
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:37,919
year as a cover crop then winter wheat

361
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,720
lentil and winter wheat and we have

362
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:46,080
three reps each crop present every year

363
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,679
and um basically we farm this rotation

364
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,399
following three

365
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:55,038
systems first one was the conventional

366
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,640
non-ti system and that system was

367
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:02,558
basically uh dependent on the use of a

368
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,799
fertilizer and fungicide we don't use

369
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,000
any

370
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:09,000
insecticides we didn't need to use an

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,038
insecticides there and

372
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,960
herbicides now you know the repeated use

373
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,919
of

374
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,319
herbicides uh results in the selection

375
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:26,080
of herbici resistant biotypes and uh we

376
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:29,200
have a currently um six biotypes I think

377
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,158
I'm missing one no seven biotypes of uh

378
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
of seven species that have been that

379
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,840
have biotypes which are resistant to

380
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,798
different herbicides um three of those

381
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,000
species um I've shown multiple herbici

382
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:46,839
resistance for example the case of wild

383
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,240
do um a vena fatwa um we have some

384
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,279
biotypes that have multiple herbicide

385
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,919
resistant and is resistant to basically

386
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:57,720
any incop herbicide so farmers have no

387
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,759
more herbicide to manage without if they

388
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,519
get that type type of resistance the

389
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:07,119
other uh kind of case of concern is kosa

390
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,319
uh because it has multiple herbicide

391
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,599
resistant but also has resistant to

392
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,480
glyphosate so again a big big challenge

393
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:19,399
to be

394
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:24,839
managed so uh the other um system we had

395
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,600
was an organic um non till system so in

396
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,839
this system basically we were

397
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,639
terminating the cover crop and managing

398
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:36,359
the weeds uh by using

399
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,559
tillage now like I said um there are

400
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,639
areas in Montana where we have around 9

401
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,720
to 11 inches of

402
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,159
precipitation um couple of months

403
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,919
Without Rain strong wings and if you use

404
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:53,039
a lot of uh tillage uh the main problem

405
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:56,720
is Sol oan so remember this photo I will

406
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:59,400
come back uh in a second so the the

407
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,720
third system that we

408
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,880
um thought as an alternative was an

409
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,360
organic system um where we reduce the

410
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,760
tillage by incorporating grazing and we

411
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:16,038
basically uh use sheep to terminate the

412
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:19,400
cover crops and manage the weeds um

413
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:22,798
before seeding and post

414
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,200
Harvest now as I said we are we did a

415
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:29,200
lot of studies there we assess yields

416
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,640
and pathogens and gr beetles and um

417
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,720
greenhouse gas emission Etc but um I

418
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,120
want to concentrate on this idea of

419
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,558
resiliency today so we wanted to stress

420
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:44,798
these systems and if we want to stress

421
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:47,960
the system clamy change is the place to

422
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,400
to start thinking and definitely it is a

423
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:55,159
major problem in Montana and these are

424
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,960
the prediction for climate change um

425
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,440
under the scenario the worst case

426
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,558
scenario of the IPC CC and basically uh

427
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,558
what they did is they divided Montana in

428
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,440
seven regions and for the 12 month of

429
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:10,038
the year the prediction is that we are

430
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,278
going to have we are already having

431
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,960
warmer and drier month the whole year is

432
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:19,079
getting warmer and

433
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,759
drier the prediction for moistures a

434
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:25,480
little more easy it's not that easy to

435
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:27,038
make those predictions um however um the

436
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,599
prediction is that we're going to get

437
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,759
more moisture

438
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,798
in the winter and spring and the fall

439
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,720
unfortunately it's going to be mostly in

440
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,359
the form of rainfall not snow so we're

441
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,000
not going to be able to accumulate so

442
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,278
much of a snow pack that we need for

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,079
then uh growing the crops during the

444
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:49,679
summer and the major problem is that the

445
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,119
prediction um suggest that during the uh

446
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,440
growing season June July and August is

447
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,959
going to be actually drier so you have

448
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,759
warmer and drier Summers it's going to

449
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,360
to be more evaporation

450
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:07,679
challenges so to simulate these uh

451
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,519
scenarios basically uh we have these

452
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,919
systems uh one is what we call the an

453
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:17,960
open top chamber um where we um were

454
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:21,440
able to increase temperatures by around

455
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,400
1 and a half to two Celsius uh and then

456
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,278
on the top of those open tote Chambers

457
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,038
uh we included these rain out shelters

458
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:35,119
uh where we further decrease moisture by

459
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:37,359
around 40% or so so we measure um soil

460
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,000
temperature and so moisture during the

461
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:44,558
summer and another thing that we did was

462
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,679
to assess uh plant responses to these

463
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,558
different three systems and three

464
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:53,519
climate scenarios

465
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,519
right and

466
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,519
um sort of a little bit to my surprise

467
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,799
um

468
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,599
climate the temperature moisture was uh

469
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:08,679
significant but it has a very slight

470
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:11,639
impact on those uh we plant communities

471
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,640
with communities a cropping system was

472
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,679
the most important variable as you can

473
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,919
see here this is the teal organic system

474
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,240
the grace organic system and the

475
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,520
conventional

476
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,558
system now something that really

477
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,200
surprised me is that I mean from

478
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:31,119
previous studies we know that the

479
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,798
conventional and organic systems are

480
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:37,759
different right we sort of already know

481
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:41,599
this difference here but seeing the

482
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:45,480
grace organic system more similar to the

483
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:49,398
conventional system versus the uh seal

484
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,919
system was sort of a surprise and uh we

485
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,439
can think that in terms of the community

486
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,559
assembly of those weeds that is

487
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:01,759
basically saying that um heing

488
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,240
seems to be the driving factors here

489
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,879
when you reduce

490
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,558
tillage the amount of till in theg gra

491
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
organic system now became to be more

492
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:14,480
similar to the conventional system that

493
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,679
is nonn till than the till organic

494
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,919
system so teage appears to be more

495
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,640
important as a filtering variable than

496
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,840
herbicides that's a hypothesis that you

497
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:32,360
may want to test uh later um another

498
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:36,480
thing that we did was to assess the

499
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:39,278
impact of these different systems and um

500
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,720
um and uh moisture and temperature

501
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:46,679
conditions on yield and this is winter

502
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,120
wheat so early spring coming out of

503
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,960
winter uh when they have a lot of

504
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,639
moisture and it's warmer in the H

505
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,919
condition those spring wheat was doing

506
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,919
really good in comparison with the iment

507
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:05,080
and the hotter and drier conditions

508
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:08,799
however um when we harvest the wheat it

509
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:12,759
was very clear that the H was already

510
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:15,119
getting nail but the warmer and drier it

511
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,558
just basically couldn't not do

512
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:23,558
it and indeed uh the relationship

513
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:26,558
between with yield and in this case is

514
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:31,119
chras uh brost tectorum sort of the

515
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:35,720
number one uh grassy weed in Winter weed

516
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:39,079
uh is of course this nonlinear negative

517
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,480
relationship but it was more pronounced

518
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:48,558
in the warmer and drier conditions so to

519
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:51,240
summarize uh we are seeing um a shift in

520
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:55,119
above ground plant communities mostly

521
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,278
due to management systems and also with

522
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:01,038
some effect on the climate scenario

523
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:03,798
but we know that the health of the

524
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,278
system and the resiliency of the system

525
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:11,079
it is on the so characteristics so we

526
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,119
wanted to check the below ground uh

527
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:14,960
biodiversity and that's when I was

528
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,639
really likey because I was able to work

529
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,840
with Sue ISAC um who's now in

530
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Maine and what she did is she uh

531
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:29,359
sample the different crops and uh and

532
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,798
management M scenarios but again I'm

533
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,479
going to concentrate on the WID uh

534
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,918
scenario and what you what we notice

535
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,679
here is that the uh evenness and the

536
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:46,559
abundance of taxonomic units um kind of

537
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,360
uh interact with the different uh

538
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,918
cropping system the non teal the organic

539
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,479
Grace and the organic teal system there

540
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,240
was basically the results were all

541
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,960
across the board it was hard to see any

542
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,599
trend TR um except that in the um

543
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,480
organic gray system and the convention

544
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:12,558
and non till system we saw kind of a

545
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,759
delay in the peak of the abundance of

546
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:20,759
those taxonomic unit so again um the

547
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,480
organic gray system was more similar to

548
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,960
the

549
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,558
conventional system non till system that

550
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,319
do the organic te

551
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:32,440
system we weren't expecting that

552
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:36,319
result uh another thing that we notice

553
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:40,320
is that as we increase Sal temperature

554
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:43,678
there was a decrease in the uh abundance

555
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,319
of those taxonomic units um I think we

556
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,519
were able to find 11 taxonomic units

557
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,359
that associated with the current

558
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:56,399
environmental conditions 17 with the

559
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:59,839
warmer and 14 with warmer and drier

560
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:04,079
conditions and as

561
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:07,959
we experimentally decrease moisture uh

562
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,439
we also saw a decrease in the number of

563
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,600
taxonomic

564
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,840
units

565
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:17,798
so one question we ask is could that be

566
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:20,959
happening would that be impacting the

567
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,359
behavior of the system and the

568
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,600
resiliency of the

569
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:29,439
system so to answer that question uh we

570
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:33,158
conducted a greenhouse

571
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,798
study and basically what we did we went

572
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:41,159
to each one of these uh three systems

573
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:43,879
and these three climate scenarios and we

574
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:48,600
collected soil and we basically have a

575
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:52,600
soul in Noom uh which is basically 4% of

576
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:55,240
the total biomass that we put in pot so

577
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:59,119
we have steam sterilized Sals in Steam

578
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,798
sterilized pots and which just added 4%

579
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:06,079
in volume like a teaspoon of that

580
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,599
soil so we sort of inoculated uh the so

581
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,599
uh the the pot with so coming from each

582
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,038
one of the three systems and each one of

583
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:16,599
the three different climate anden areas

584
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:21,158
and we have our controls so we have

585
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:26,959
wheat in the field we grew wheat and

586
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:29,519
then uh yep we harvest the wheat and we

587
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,440
grew weat again so we have wheat over

588
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,679
wheat over wheat that's our conditioning

589
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,519
and then we have our response phase and

590
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,798
for the response phase uh we grew either

591
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:44,599
wheat or a phenetically different

592
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:47,679
distant species in this case we use p

593
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:51,079
and why we and the way we analyzed this

594
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,320
was by calculating the soul feedbacks

595
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:56,678
and basically the soul feedback is the

596
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,079
natural log of the biomass when it is

597
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,080
inoculated

598
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,199
divided the um biomass when it's not

599
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,960
inoculated

600
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,600
so above zero means that the plants with

601
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,399
the inoculation that inoculum enhances

602
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,678
the growth of the plant and below zero

603
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,959
means that it inhibit the growth of the

604
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,919
plant so in a way it's an assessment on

605
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,159
the impact of those own microbial

606
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,679
communities on the growth of the plants

607
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,880
so

608
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:33,880
what we decided to use this phenetically

609
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,919
different species because um the couple

610
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,080
of years before that study with Zak

611
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:45,519
Miller uh we conducted a study where we

612
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:47,519
have 11 um conditioning SP species we

613
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,240
grab soil from prairies and and crop

614
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,480
fields and we have 11 conditioning

615
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,200
species we grow them for several

616
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,278
generation and then we grew a four

617
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,519
different response species and with we

618
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,759
try to see if we could predict the soul

619
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,558
feedback based on the philogenetic

620
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:09,798
distance and what we notice is that as

621
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:13,558
you increase the phenetic distance the

622
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:15,038
feedbacks tend to go from more negative

623
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:19,038
to more

624
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:22,558
positive why is that well uh if you grow

625
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:24,960
whe over wheat over wheat we know uh we

626
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,079
are going to be increasing pathogenic

627
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,319
organ microorganisms and you're going to

628
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,398
have these negative feedbacks but if you

629
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,519
rotate your crops that's I mean that's a

630
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,719
base of crop rotation basically to plant

631
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,278
something different you don't want to

632
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,798
grow whe and barley we barley that's not

633
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:47,759
a real rotation okay so again we have

634
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,000
three system three climate conditions uh

635
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,720
wheat over wheat over wheat and when we

636
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,480
planted wheat uh we because it's the

637
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,919
same species

638
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,679
phenetically uh we expected to see an

639
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
increase in pathogenic

640
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,440
microorganisms um and therefore we

641
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,120
expected to see more negative feedback

642
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,240
and the say the less negative feedback

643
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,759
will be that the system is more

644
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,519
resistant to the accumulation of those

645
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,319
pathogens okay

646
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,720
so if it doesn't accumulate those

647
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,879
pathogen that fast then it will be more

648
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,480
resistant to that pathogenic Community

649
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
or the development of a pathogenic

650
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,360
community in the

651
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,399
soil when we grw a phenetically

652
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:39,038
different species P we expected to now

653
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,839
uh see

654
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,319
basically potential decrease in those

655
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,158
pathogenic

656
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,398
microorganisms and we expected to

657
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,000
see either less negative feedback or

658
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:56,558
even positive feedback and the faster

659
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,839
they can recover we can think that's an

660
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,759
estim of the resiliency of the

661
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,319
system

662
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:08,280
okay so again I'm going to present the

663
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:12,358
soul feedback Center on zero means no

664
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:16,440
impact for the three systems non Grace

665
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:18,838
and till organic um above zero good

666
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,918
there's promotion of growth below zero

667
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,838
there's um s

668
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,398
inhibition and what we notice is that

669
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,878
when we grow weight over weight over

670
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,918
weight

671
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:34,799
um in the non- conventional and the

672
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:38,719
grace organic system again those two

673
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,639
systems uh kind of behave

674
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,918
similarly and they have a negative

675
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,000
feedback and we

676
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:50,239
saw more positive or less negative

677
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,440
feedback close to zero um in the case of

678
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,439
the teal organic system so we can say

679
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,240
that the te organic system is more

680
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,838
resistant probably because you are

681
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,679
mixing the so quite a lot you don't

682
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:03,440
allow that accumulation of pathogenic

683
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:06,639
microorganism I don't know that's the

684
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,960
case but before you go to Montana and

685
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:12,679
start talking about tillage

686
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,039
remember it's a very that's not a good

687
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,118
idea okay because you're going to be um

688
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:22,719
or the chances of losing Soul due to

689
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:25,800
erosion are very uh High the good news

690
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:29,480
here is that the three systems under the

691
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,079
current climate conditions um have the

692
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,358
same level of um resiliency so this is

693
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,240
under the current climate condition now

694
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:41,880
when we look at the predicted climate

695
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:44,439
conditions that's um warmer and drier

696
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,920
conditions that's we going to show what

697
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:51,880
we know we notice is that we lost the uh

698
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,960
resistance of the system we didn't

699
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,599
recover and also we lost the resiliency

700
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,599
of the system

701
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,400
so again we are losing uh we shifting

702
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,960
with communities we are hurting crop

703
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:12,400
yields we are losing the resiliency and

704
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:15,358
resistance of our crop Fields so in

705
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,119
essence what I wanted to show is that

706
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:23,639
even this incredibly simplified system

707
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,960
are very complex and in these systems

708
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,879
just a change in the management

709
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,400
practices could enhance the associated

710
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,559
biodiversity in terms of uh having

711
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,559
different community of wheat that will

712
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,960
have a bottom up effect on the

713
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,400
beneficial

714
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:46,599
organisms and you will have healthier

715
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,160
and more diverse community of

716
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:53,559
pollinators however

717
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:55,239
under um predicted climate conditions

718
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:59,719
unfortunately

719
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:03,479
uh the scenario is pre dire now the

720
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,759
other good news is that even these

721
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,119
highly simplified systems are that's

722
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,760
what I learned after being almost 20

723
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,760
years in Montana is that even these

724
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,160
extremely simplified systems you can

725
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,280
still have fun and do uh research so I

726
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,078
think we have a few minutes for

727
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,400
questions yeah well let's first of all

728
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,400
thank

729
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,240
faan

730
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,240
let's open it up for

731
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,639
questions it can't be that simple this

732
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,239
oh sorry go ahead hey thanks for a great

733
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,118
talk it's really fun to see all the

734
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:48,919
agriology in action thank you um going

735
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:52,079
back to some of the work on pollinators

736
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,079
and weeds and the organic versus

737
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,920
conventional systems um it seems like a

738
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,519
lot of the the negative effect of those

739
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,760
weeds is going to be a reduction in

740
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:03,119
yield whereas some of that positive

741
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,280
effect would be for pollinators

742
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,519
potentially and some of the nearby

743
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,400
systems there's a little bit of a

744
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,880
spatial mismatch there and I was

745
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,480
wondering if you can talk a little bit

746
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,280
about um how that might affect some of

747
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,199
the the farmer decision making around

748
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,519
weighing these C for benefits that's

749
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,919
that's a great question so the idea was

750
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,838
to see how farmers will perceive the

751
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,559
potential benefits of wheat versus the

752
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,400
cost of yield

753
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,400
one of the thing that I did not show

754
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,240
because I thought I kind of steering

755
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,680
into the story of resistant resiliency

756
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,559
is that

757
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:41,399
um one of the studies we did um before

758
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,599
the greenhouse study and before the

759
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,318
philogen this study the first thing that

760
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,119
we did with Sue ISAC uh was to go to um

761
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:53,599
I think it was four pair of organic and

762
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,720
conventional Fields you know kind of a

763
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,079
fence apart and take souls and yes sure

764
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,959
enough we were able to see that um the

765
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,039
microbial communities was affect were

766
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,400
affected by um you know the management

767
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:13,559
systems and then we did a similar um PL

768
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:17,000
so feedback study where we saw that the

769
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,559
if you if uh the crop receives an

770
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,039
inoculum um of coming from the organic

771
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:28,279
system happens that crop we competition

772
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:32,639
was decreased and that was a sort of a

773
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,960
hypothesis um Rich me Matt you were

774
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,279
there as well what was it the new

775
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,440
hypothesis for can't remember the whole

776
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,240
title of that paper yes research pool

777
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,599
yeah the research pool hypothesis the

778
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:48,838
idea that actually in those system we

779
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:51,640
have more Diversified um you correct me

780
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:54,759
you have more Diversified cropping plant

781
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,639
species um they will be able to forge

782
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,800
they will be uh a different microb

783
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,519
communities Associated and therefore

784
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,680
they will be forging for different pools

785
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,119
and therefore um the crop we competition

786
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,919
is different so in essence what I'm

787
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,280
saying is that if you go to an organic

788
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,960
field and you look at the floor you see

789
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,440
it's Prett wiy and that's something

790
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Bruce Maxwell told me the first time

791
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,000
just look at the crop and you go oh my

792
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,559
God the crop is really good so so those

793
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,199
I think Farmers organic farmers don't

794
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,239
have the options not to uh

795
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,759
not you they can't spray so they have to

796
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:32,759
live with those weeds but it happened

797
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,440
that it doesn't appear to be as

798
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,440
competitive

799
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,680
so thank

800
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:41,838
you

801
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,440
har um you said that the future is

802
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:47,358
pretty dire for weed in Montana at the

803
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,920
very end there what do given your

804
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,920
experience there what would you

805
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,318
recommendations be for Farmers facing

806
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,318
that

807
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,318
situation

808
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:11,358
um so I think there was a quite a lot of

809
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:14,759
uh first before right now I'm doing I'm

810
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:17,199
I'm teaching research but I was doing um

811
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,599
extension for the first 17 years and and

812
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,358
one of the things that I did is was uh

813
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,838
going around Montana I gave what a lot

814
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:26,838
of talks about climate change and weeds

815
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:30,078
you know even 12 years ago when it

816
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:33,039
wasn't really popular press so I think

817
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,920
it's important um to raise the awareness

818
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,039
because if you're not aware and and when

819
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,838
you start showing like hey your

820
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:42,559
herbicides are not going to be working

821
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:45,279
because uh the stomata closes Etc so uh

822
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,639
Farmers start to react to those that was

823
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,800
my experience so first will be to raise

824
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:55,519
awareness second um there is um an

825
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,880
interest some people are saying um we

826
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:01,239
may need to to move into more winter

827
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,720
wheat versus spring wheat because um you

828
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:08,118
know that's the reality we we you don't

829
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:11,199
get hit by those um um really dry

830
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:15,599
Summers um there's also some interesting

831
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:18,159
developing um some some uh weat breeders

832
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,000
have been uh breeding some varieties

833
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:24,519
which are more Dr resistant and trying

834
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,559
to find crop rotations which are also

835
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:31,119
less demanding in terms of uh moisture

836
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:35,880
but in Montana it's going to be a huge

837
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:39,240
problem it is it is a huge huge problem

838
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,240
so there's nothing you can

839
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:42,239
do

840
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,920
so so the question is if this if you

841
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,960
have oh yes that's a good question the

842
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,519
fun communities yes we did that we have

843
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,838
a CR student um who did that and she

844
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:08,519
promised me two years ago that she was

845
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:12,119
going to publish the paper next week

846
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:16,440
and still waiting so

847
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,760
Y no fortunately

848
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,000
she thank

849
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,079
you yeah Bob excellent presentation

850
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,679
there thanks for sharing it with us I'm

851
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,440
wondering if you can talk a little bit

852
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,639
about meat bow and alternative props

853
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,599
that you could insert into that system

854
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,920
and opportunities for increasing water

855
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,800
use efficiency uh with PE or other crops

856
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,480
i' I've heard stories um maybe from like

857
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,519
Randy Anderson other people about

858
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,039
putting in peas and seeing um a positive

859
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:51,719
yield response yes so um first the

860
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:54,199
person to ask uh will be perimeter he's

861
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,639
he's our cropping system specialist and

862
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,639
that's basically to to your question

863
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,118
that's what he's been working quite a

864
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,679
lot trying to find more efficient crop

865
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,920
rotations and that's what I said uh

866
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,799
there is a push uh towards the

867
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,599
diversification of the coping system

868
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,680
build bring po crops there a lot of

869
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:17,960
money uh organic farmers L lentils but

870
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:21,639
also um in terms of um uh water use

871
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,599
efficiency and nitrogen uh you know it

872
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:28,039
brings a a positive impact on on the

873
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,838
system so the I think the um the wi

874
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:34,358
follow system sort of unfortunately

875
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:36,759
keeps uh staying around because I'm

876
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,960
going to be using my sociological heart

877
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,760
here forgive me if you're sociologist

878
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,639
but most of the farmers uh tend to be 65

879
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,359
or older maybe and they are like I've

880
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,558
been doing this for my whole life I'm

881
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:54,799
not trying to change now so it is kind

882
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,720
of a I mean there's a lot of evidence

883
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,039
that um

884
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,199
there's a benefits ergonomic benefits

885
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:05,800
for raining incorporating these people's

886
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:08,118
crops but the mentality still we want to

887
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,920
to manage as we did for the last you

888
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,960
know several

889
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,599
Generations the positive effects on that

890
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,720
is that you think it's more of the

891
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,920
um it's hard to understand how you can

892
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,318
get a a an increase in water use

893
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,240
efficiency when you have a crop instead

894
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,400
of a period you know but there are these

895
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:28,000
other effects

896
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,680
I think it's more in terms of the

897
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,199
overall net benefits economic benefits

898
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:37,960
net revenues of the farm because you are

899
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,000
uh fixing nitrogen and also you have an

900
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,838
instead of having follow that just cost

901
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,480
money you have um another source of

902
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:50,799
Revenue so overall what Perry is seeing

903
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,039
is that is not as bad as uh thought but

904
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,960
there is a a a a net benefit and again

905
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:59,719
I'm talking about the D places in

906
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,599
Montana I'm looking you know North

907
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:05,118
Central Montana that's why like these

908
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:08,440
people okay so if you go to uh Northeast

909
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,240
Montana and and probably South uh uh

910
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,119
East Montana where there's definitely

911
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,519
more moisture that's not the issue I'm

912
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:20,599
talking about the highly simplified

913
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:23,719
systems one last question go ahead

914
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:25,559
BR combine two questions here they're

915
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,799
related um so the first part of my

916
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,800
question

917
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,559
I was wondering if that was the same

918
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,558
across all three

919
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,960
systems no yeah no there was there was

920
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,920
like I said in the three systems you you

921
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,119
lost that resistance because the the

922
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,000
organic till system lost that resiliency

923
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,200
was all negative and the three system

924
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,079
that have slightly positive perhaps I

925
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,118
didn't explain correctly slightly

926
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,920
positive feedbacks in the current

927
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:09,880
climatic conditions where we added the P

928
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:14,039
they kind of went to have zero or

929
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:17,200
slightly negative feedback in the warmer

930
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:20,199
and drier condition so they became less

931
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,199
resilient

932
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:30,000
so no no but we were um that was yeah

933
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,880
the system was WID over WID over WID or

934
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,239
WID WID P so WID with p is when you

935
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,000
rotate the crop you get that we use that

936
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:43,879
as a proxy to assess resiliency how fast

937
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,358
the system recover and they they recover

938
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,240
really well in current conditions but

939
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:53,759
they did not recover at almost at all in

940
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,118
in the future climatic conditions and

941
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,280
and if you keep having we over wi over

942
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,760
WID which is the best the worst uh

943
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,800
management decision it will be bad for

944
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,480
any one of the three

945
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,680
systems

946
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:12,599
okay

947
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:12,598
sure um mention the organic

948
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:17,480
noav I would

949
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,119
imagine

950
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:26,919
she that it would do better than a

951
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,519
relatively dead

952
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,480
system

953
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:34,719
simar how how

954
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:37,760
similar so that that's a good question

955
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:40,118
so comparing but the organic Grace

956
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,359
versus the conventional non till but in

957
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,800
that system we did not have follow if

958
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:49,960
you remember we have a fiveyear rotation

959
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:52,680
was um safflower Clover interceded then

960
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:57,318
winter whe uh lentils winter wheight so

961
00:48:52,679 --> 00:49:00,118
we didn't have follow but yes um we were

962
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:03,119
thinking that just the organic matter

963
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:06,880
that sheep was Distributing will enhance

964
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,440
the system the and I'm kind of a maybe

965
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,440
not I don't know if I'm going to be

966
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,760
answering your question no one asked me

967
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,358
it's like oh so it's organic Grace the

968
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,680
solution and it's like no because

969
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,400
actually we at the fifth year we got to

970
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:24,039
fourth year and then by the fifth year

971
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,240
we got totally nailed by Canada thisel

972
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,960
The Perennial weight that was probably

973
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,558
I we suspected they were coming out of

974
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,440
the system and we just could not I mean

975
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:39,640
she will just look at it and go like I'm

976
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:43,358
that so so um we you know we we were

977
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:46,480
very enthusiastic for three years and in

978
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,759
terms of the Agronomy of the system we

979
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,559
at least that rotation was not the best

980
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,000
one for perinal which which is the the

981
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,519
major problem the keys of death in

982
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,519
organic systems

983
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:00,280
well let's

984
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,680
