1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,719
University all right thank you very

3
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,679
much I don't think it

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,960
works it

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,439
yeah all right thank you thank you very

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,719
muchan so

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,399
yeah digital

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
a

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,320
uh assistant professor of digital

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,000
Agronomy so I want to uh to tell you a

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,200
little bit more so last week it was like

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,079
a very quick lightning talk about few

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,680
things that we are doing in in the

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,280
program this week I would like to go a a

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit more in depth in

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,879
um what uh what we're trying to achieve

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,920
uh uh bringing the the the the people

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,518
together uh trying to change things

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,399
maybe uh in different ways how we we

20
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:06,560
want to to accelerate change uh in

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:10,879
agriculture so that we uh we can reach

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,519
sustainable a and agroecology faster

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:17,959
than the pace that we are on right now

24
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,920
so uh I'm uh sorry that I want I want to

25
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,199
share something early on with you here

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,719
always the same thing here you need to

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
click on the thing

28
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:31,078
first yeah I want to share this with you

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,840
this is uh I I I uh watched a talk from

30
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,359
rockstrom Joan rockstrom it came out

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,680
like three weeks back and in the Ted

32
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,640
Talk he's presenting so it's kind of an

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,799
update on the planetary boundaries that

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,478
came out like in 2009 but there's a new

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,399
report 2023 and he's talking about the

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,679
Tipping Point so here what you see is

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,439
that see a human pushing the Earth and

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,118
potentially Crossing that dipping point

39
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,158
and then the new normal is Hot House H

40
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,959
so this is kind of a scary thing but

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,840
then he goes in details and then he show

42
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:07,639
those those spping points across the

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:10,239
planet and um we can see that

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,598
on

45
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,159
uh we can see that for a bunch of those

46
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,839
like six the five first ones we all

47
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,639
we're already in the in the line where

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,759
we can see those stepping Point changing

49
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,199
how uh our planet looks like Okay so

50
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,079
this tells us

51
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,759
that I said we need to have something

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,319
happening not in 10 years not in 20

53
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,079
years right now we need to see change um

54
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:43,000
and then sustainable development goals

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,640
uh from the UN started in 2015 we are in

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,759
2024 the goal is to achieve all that by

57
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:55,839
2030 clock is taking so um we make a lot

58
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,039
of Innovations and progress in ag

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,200
research okay we have different uh

60
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,639
different fields and we are kind of

61
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,318
attacking the problems from all sides

62
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,439
and we are finding

63
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,958
Solutions and we all hope

64
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,639
that it goes like this so we invent a

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,719
solution we run with that thing pass it

66
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,878
to the farmers Farmers take that take

67
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,239
that thing and then just run with it and

68
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,959
then changes happening but the reality

69
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,640
is that it's a little bit more complex

70
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
once you have invented something when

71
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,000
you once you have put something together

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,759
that you've demonstrated with

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,120
scientifically that it can have a change

74
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,878
it can make a change uh it's not

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,280
necessarily happening at the pace that

76
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,079
we would like okay so this is an

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,959
illustration here

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,480
of a recent paper based on a remote

79
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,319
sensing they looked at cover crop in the

80
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,318
midwest so uh how much do you think

81
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:54,039
what's what was the percentage in 2011

82
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:56,199
of the land in the midwest that had

83
00:03:54,039 --> 00:04:00,959
cover

84
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:02,959
crops okay spoiler 5.4 and now you look

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,719
at this

86
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,079
uh we really want that thing to work

87
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,079
doesn't

88
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,959
work work U again you you look at the

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,120
title of the paper rapid increase in

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
cover crop adoption across the Midwest

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,879
what rapid increase looks like is like

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,439
this this is real

93
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,560
data

94
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,319
uh I mean we have plenty of scientific

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,439
evidence that cover crops are good and

96
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:36,439
they are compatible with uh with

97
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:40,160
farming yet adoption is is is tricky

98
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,759
other examples this is in the do region

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,720
in France I'm just going to read that

100
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,360
thing so project involving 400 farms and

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,000
around 40 40 villages in the doev region

102
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,919
in Western France where scientists are

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,478
experimenting with different techniques

104
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,478
to cut pollution even the farmers who

105
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,279
participated in the experiment and saw

106
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,758
the results with their own

107
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:06,119
did not noticeably change their

108
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,080
practices what does that tell us is that

109
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,240
you had scientists

110
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,758
there demonstrating and experimenting on

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,800
Farmers field but farmers were not the

112
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,199
leaders of that thing they were

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,079
observing that it going and it did not

114
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,160
stick they did not adopt it as their own

115
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,560
practice they did not integrated in

116
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,919
their practices another long quote from

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Dan toi conservation practitioner in

118
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,959
Indiana okay if noil corn is done let

119
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
let me turn around if noil corn is done

120
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,959
incorrectly for example if a farmer uses

121
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,560
the wrong planter setup or does not use

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,000
starter fertilizer on the planter corn

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,000
yields and profits may be

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,319
reduced if this happens when a producer

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,120
first switches to no till they may be

126
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,960
more likely to go back to previous

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,720
methods this case tillage there is

128
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,918
always a learning curve with something

129
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
new this makes some producers risk

130
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,159
adverse because because if they do

131
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,360
something different they may miss

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
important details and run the risk of

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,800
reduced yield this is kind of a simple

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,280
thing that we can all picture in our

135
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,800
head but this is an important process

136
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,079
going on when Farmers try something to

137
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,280
gather evidence that it works for them

138
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,639
if it doesn't work then now they have

139
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,519
evidence that it doesn't work for them

140
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,079
okay so what I want to get at is that

141
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,318
change is a people's

142
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,959
process and very interesting uh

143
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,160
paper it's it's they are about to

144
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,038
release it but I was able toh to get

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,680
access to it because I know I know the

146
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:46,399
authors from Ruiz and Dumont 2024 what

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,800
they did is that they studied 50 Farmar

148
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,918
over six years that were adopting cover

149
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,478
crops okay like the process of adopting

150
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,598
the the practice of cover crops on their

151
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,959
part what they did is so they are social

152
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,279
scientists and what they did is that

153
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:06,719
they they try to see where they are in

154
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,119
that uh chain of process from inaction

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,039
where you don't even have an opinion you

156
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,199
don't really care to integration okay

157
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,680
and integration here it's a little bit

158
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,639
different from uh adoption in their

159
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
perspective where if you do something on

160
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
your farm is considered adopted like you

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,800
can check the box they adopted it but in

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,520
their definition it's more like uh like

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,319
a tractor if you if your tractor bre

164
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,279
braks you're not like ah I'm not going

165
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,160
to use tractors anymore doesn't work for

166
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,318
me you're going to fix the damn thing

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,000
and make it work because it's integrated

168
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,879
in your operations it's part of your of

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,399
your farming okay so from inaction to

170
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,960
interaction uh integration

171
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:51,120
sorry then there are three steps here

172
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:54,439
from resistance to amb to inflection and

173
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,399
all my life this is where the my scien

174
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,519
scientific work this is where I have

175
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,560
operated I'm studying uh things in the

176
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,439
field research Farm uh even on farms

177
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,079
Gathering evidence WR analyzing the data

178
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,719
preparing scientific publication

179
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,519
extension Publications uh presentations

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,199
like that seminars and then I uh show

181
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,639
the evidence that things are working

182
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,520
things are will benefit the farmers

183
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,918
things will will make a better better

184
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,639
life better everything and then the idea

185
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,598
here is to tip the perception from yeah

186
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,439
it doesn't work it's not good to oh yeah

187
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:33,759
okay yeah seems good let me try it so

188
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,838
it's just like to to to change to go

189
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,479
from negative to

190
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,279
positive but I kind of have stopped

191
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,959
there normally when once I have like I

192
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,639
publish stuff then I move on to the next

193
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,079
thing and then continue working on

194
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,838
things that are not finished and then

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,399
working on other stuff and then I'm just

196
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,920
trying to push that information yeah

197
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,039
it's going to work you should try it on

198
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:59,879
your farm but this is similar to a lot

199
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:02,039
of scientists where we stop here then at

200
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,278
that point Farmers needs to take that

201
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,399
bat on that we are TR giving it to them

202
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:10,200
now they need to pick it up when they

203
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,759
are they perceive a positive uh benefits

204
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,278
on on so at this point what they will do

205
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,838
is that they will experiment with that

206
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:20,000
new uh new approach new technique in my

207
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,560
case it was Precision management input

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,120
management but it could really be

209
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,479
anything they want to obtain evidence

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,919
that it works for

211
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,759
them we run series of interviews in in

212
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,879
in New York to ask farmers how are they

213
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,159
experimenting say we met with 15 Farmers

214
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,958
two hours each and then we just like

215
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,078
discuss the experimentation process and

216
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,599
you would be surprised that a bunch of

217
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,078
them they would do a side by side

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,720
experiment and then I'm asking them I'm

219
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,039
digital AG so I'm like okay what data do

220
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,800
you get how do you analyze your data and

221
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,159
and more than one ins something like

222
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,078
this I see it from the tractor cabin

223
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:07,360
when I harvest yeah it work or it didn't

224
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,199
work that's the data that they use to

225
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,919
see to to move on for next year the that

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,160
will influence the decisions from for

227
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,199
next

228
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:21,278
year this experimentation process is not

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,879
trivial okay I I put it there here

230
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,278
because I wanted to to show that we went

231
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,879
from the to Saint to the corn that we

232
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,278
know there was no experimental design

233
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,000
there was no science involved it was all

234
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:37,879
on Farm experimentation same thing here

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,039
for the three sisters uh way to grow

236
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:44,958
crops or for the use a fish head to bury

237
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,799
under each crop to to get the the

238
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,958
nutrients no science no uh no experiment

239
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,639
no no experimental design no statistics

240
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,638
or nothing involved and this can have

241
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,519
evolved to towards things that work

242
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,959
things that are very significant like

243
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,159
from theci core I mean this is

244
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,599
something okay so I just wanted to point

245
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,120
point this here that this is an

246
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,839
important process happening in parallel

247
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,000
with scientific research that we are

248
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,800
doing okay so when farmers are

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,639
experimenting on their farm with that

250
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,159
new practice that they were convinced

251
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,519
that W it could it could do something

252
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,799
for me help me more more environmentally

253
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,519
friendly or uh improve my Ben my profits

254
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,399
and things like that when they

255
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,039
experiment with it and if they see

256
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
something that doesn't

257
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,199
work then the danger is that they are

258
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
back to square one because the square

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
one is resistance I know that is it

260
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,000
doesn't work so now you have all that

261
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,560
work to go back to before they can try

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,639
again and in this study they looked at

263
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,719
how long it would take for Farmers to go

264
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,120
from one box to the other and it takes

265
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,959
about two years on average okay so this

266
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,799
is a real setback and thinking that we

267
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,319
need to accelerate progress I mean this

268
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:58,240
is not

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,760
trivial so uh I perceive this

270
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,240
experimentation here as a crucial

271
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:07,958
process uh for Change and

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:11,440
progress okay so then what we realize is

273
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:14,638
that everything that we do we develop in

274
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,079
science uh will go through the filter of

275
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,399
unarm experimentation before it creates

276
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:22,759
a real impact on

277
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,320
agriculture and what we know is that

278
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,399
conventional research benefits from all

279
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,839
the bells of and whistles of Technology

280
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,519
ing data organization data analysis and

281
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,720
all that while unarm experimentation is

282
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,679
a very low Tech process which mean that

283
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,040
it's prone to error because if you don't

284
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,838
have if all you have is to look by the

285
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:49,360
tractor window you may either do make

286
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,880
the wrong decision or you may not

287
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,000
understand why you made the wrong or the

288
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:58,799
good decision

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,320
okay so the premise of why program is

290
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,679
that digal a can support endogenous

291
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,320
experimentation and this is not just my

292
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,519
program that does that a lot of people

293
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,440
that have develop Precision agriculture

294
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,240
techniques really realize that yeah if

295
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm doing this uh if I'm able to gather

296
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,959
all those yield Maps those as applied

297
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,159
maps and all the good stuff that that is

298
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,679
going on in Precision a real maybe we

299
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,159
can use it to experiment and then

300
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,638
there's a bunch of of different groups

301
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,198
across the so you see group groups from

302
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,320
Canada NGO

303
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:39,359
universities um you see a group in

304
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,160
France here uh and this is really very

305
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,560
short SP partial list but it shows that

306
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,078
like people are are trying to to make

307
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,479
this like a new way of uh of uh

308
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,638
collaborating with Farmers through the

309
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,839
the the data okay so we see a diversity

310
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,879
in the in in approaches from groups that

311
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,720
are more researcher Centric so they

312
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,198
would build a protocol and try to

313
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,000
disseminate it at to as many farms as

314
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:09,439
possible two groups that are more farmer

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,679
Centric uh sorry here okay strict

316
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,680
experimental design versus more open

317
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,278
design so here you have a protocol that

318
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,758
everybody needs to to adopt to be part

319
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,078
of the network while here everybody can

320
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,919
do their own protocol and then you have

321
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,120
here more researchers andrick where you

322
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,479
want to have more um the goal is to do

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,600
scientific Publications and here you

324
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,039
have more farmer Centric the goal here

325
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,800
is to have more pragmatic information to

326
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,159
see what works for them on their Farm

327
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,639
okay so I this is cooked up like just

328
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,838
through those uh those points there to

329
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,600
to to uh to illustrate a little bit the

330
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,720
different the the the

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,959
distribution uh but what's interesting

332
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,680
is that all those group have common

333
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,919
challenges how to gather and

334
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,198
contextualize the observations how to

335
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,639
analyze the data how to help farmers

336
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,599
learn from their

337
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,959
experiments and

338
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,040
uh now that we are starting to engage

339
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,119
with Farmers those challenge emerge and

340
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,599
then we need to develop the science the

341
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,159
solutions to make this process uh more

342
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,320
fluid and more easy to so that we can

343
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,439
scale in this process basically what we

344
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,440
are doing is that we're changing what we

345
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,360
used to call an adic do okay if you see

346
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,360
you have a farmer you go visit with a

347
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,440
farmer hey I've seen this and in that

348
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,680
field for scientist we see this as okay

349
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,199
this is an interesting observation and

350
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,278
and actually we use observations like

351
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,799
that to create hypothesis but for us

352
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:47,318
this is an anecdote it's anecdotal we

353
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,958
don't necessarily consider this as

354
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,559
potentially a scientific evid

355
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,479
observation but with that with data

356
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,239
science what we can do is that we can

357
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,199
transform this into something scientific

358
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,039
everybody have heard of the G by e by m

359
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:06,039
so the idea here is to say okay you saw

360
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,679
this that observation what was the G by

361
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,439
E by m

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,239
context uh of this observation and now

363
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,959
this makes that one observation worthy

364
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,399
of a scientific database that we can use

365
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,159
to start learning to see Trends and

366
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,559
patterns that can emerge that we may not

367
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:28,278
have seen um with the traditional small

368
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,000
plot experiment or by just talking with

369
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,120
farmers at the the coffee shop and

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,720
learning from their anecdotes here and

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,799
there

372
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,720
okay um globally if farmers in

373
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:43,559
Innovations were valued at just 05% of

374
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,278
farming production which is4 trillion

375
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,359
dollar that would match formal R&amp;D

376
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,639
investment from the private sector which

377
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,839
is about20 billion so I put it there

378
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,519
just to to show like the scale of if we

379
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,600
are able to transform those observations

380
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,399
into something to Scientific data I mean

381
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,199
all of a sudden we have access to a

382
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:10,078
wealth of new data to learn uh about

383
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,480
Agronomy and about

384
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,599
agriculture um so here I would it's not

385
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,519
just about data okay so I want to uh to

386
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,639
kind of describe a little bit what is

387
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,798
the the the on Farm experimentation

388
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,000
cycle so here first we uh we need to

389
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,199
engage with Farmers Farmers need to

390
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,720
understand what we're trying to do why

391
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,038
we're doing it and

392
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,240
uh and we need to understand why also

393
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,200
they want to experiment and and to be on

394
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,079
there on to be on the same page with

395
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,200
them so that when we engage we help them

396
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,439
Reach their

397
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,480
goals um and then comes the part where

398
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,440
we acquire the data we clean and

399
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,000
assemble the data organize it we do some

400
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,798
first analysis then we we uh continue

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,599
the analysis with some things that are

402
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,519
more in depth and then we discuss with

403
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:05,119
the farmers and partners to learn uh

404
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:08,119
together from the the results and then

405
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,759
um we have a process to uh review and

406
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:13,798
repeat and the idea here is that if we

407
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:16,359
are able to close that Loop of

408
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:18,839
experimentation within one year we are

409
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,959
more in line with what Farmers typically

410
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,918
do that they iterate until they have a

411
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,679
working solution as opposed to uh how

412
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,559
scientists experiment where we want to

413
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,960
replicate two three years the same

414
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,839
experimental design the same protocol so

415
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,880
that we can publish from it okay but if

416
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,399
you look at this thing here you have

417
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,559
really different groups going on so here

418
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,919
you will have more agronomist and social

419
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,359
scientists here you will have agronomist

420
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,480
but also data scientists involved and

421
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,079
again here to interpret the results and

422
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,038
to understand the farmers and to to to

423
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,558
help farmers learn from that result

424
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,679
again we have Agronomy and social

425
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,079
science so this makes really makes it a

426
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,320
co-creation process where we recognize

427
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:06,319
local actors capacity to explore and we

428
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,519
build on the scientist capacity to

429
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,240
quantify and detect patterns okay this

430
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,200
is um at least in digital Agronomy this

431
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,359
is what we are good at to quantify

432
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,440
things and detect Trends and

433
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,279
patterns uh so this is really a good

434
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,558
example of decentralized research and

435
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,240
the idea is to try to be iterative and

436
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:29,599
flexible so what I wanted to show you

437
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,480
here is this is an a

438
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,639
transdisciplinary approach okay because

439
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,679
you have all three Agronomy data science

440
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,038
and social science working

441
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,960
together Agronomy is there for

442
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,879
consistent interpretation okay so we use

443
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,200
the science uh soil and crop science

444
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,120
chemistry physics biology to have

445
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,919
consistent interpretation we use that

446
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:58,119
science to to interpret what we are

447
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,799
seeing then we use data science to get

448
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,439
greater certainty so whatever we we

449
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,519
conclude whatever we uh we analyze is

450
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,120
based on actual data and then we have

451
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,279
social science to make this a more

452
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,719
effective process to to to help people

453
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,000
work together

454
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,240
basically so at the middle of this this

455
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,519
is the unarm experimentation process so

456
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,359
that was kind of the that was my intro

457
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,319
on on Farm experimentation to for you to

458
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,439
understand a little bit what is the

459
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,319
principle and what I want to do next is

460
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,679
to show you a quick example of uh how it

461
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,439
could look like in practice okay so what

462
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,559
we I've never done a program like this

463
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,279
when I was at agriculture AG Food Canada

464
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:44,038
I started to work on a living lab uh

465
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,879
with Farmers to uh the objective was to

466
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,720
reduce the pollution in the S Lake which

467
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,880
is a part of the St Lawrence River and

468
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,079
that was the only thing and then we just

469
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,120
start sitting together and trying to

470
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,879
understand who is doing what scientists

471
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,158
like explaining better what is the

472
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,640
problem far

473
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,120
trying to understand the problem and

474
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,240
maybe linked to some practices but and

475
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,719
then I left and I came here so um that

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,159
would have been my first experience here

477
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,558
uh this is my first experience here was

478
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,159
with

479
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,918
Biologicals um so what I did is that I

480
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,600
thought okay let I want to try this idea

481
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,679
the idea of really helping Farmers

482
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,678
experiment but on their term to to

483
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,840
support farmer lead

484
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,000
experimentation so what I did is that I

485
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:34,480
consulted with extension Specialists and

486
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,919
uh industry uh service providers to

487
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,038
under to to learn like what our Farmers

488
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,240
uh interested in this year what are they

489
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:45,079
experimenting with and a lot of uh this

490
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,919
came back on Biologicals okay the idea

491
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,839
was that so biological is like a it's a

492
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,600
bacteries or a cocktail of bacteries

493
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,199
that you apply with the corn at seeding

494
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,240
and this thing is able to fix nitrogen

495
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,600
and Supply a part of the nitrogen to the

496
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,759
crop and on that uh the beginning of the

497
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,278
project it was everybody wanted to

498
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,119
experiment with it first because it was

499
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:09,640
a big um promotion campaign from the

500
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,119
company but also the numbers were kind

501
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,200
of aligning okay they were saying that

502
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,639
they would that would provide 40 units

503
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:21,480
of nitrogen so that would look like a $5

504
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,799
saving per hectare uh per acre uh for

505
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,839
the for the farmers so they kind of said

506
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,200
okay let me try it basically they were

507
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,798
they went on the Tipping Point they were

508
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,600
con vinced to try it on their

509
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:38,440
Farm uh so then we consulted with

510
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,639
specialists in soil this is a soil

511
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,278
microbiology uh project so I'm not a

512
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,720
soil microbiologist so I the the process

513
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,880
of unarm experimentation relies on

514
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,159
working with experts so here we

515
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,200
consulted with Dan and Alysia to

516
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,000
understand like okay how is this thing

517
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:02,120
working so basically the bacteria what

518
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,880
what happen is that you are have um the

519
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:09,439
bacteria in the soil in natural it's

520
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:12,640
there naturally okay and then it fixes

521
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
nitrogen buing being like in subis with

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,120
the

523
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:20,798
roots and then when it has enough

524
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:23,519
nitrogen for its uh its organism boom it

525
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,519
stops fixing the nitrogen okay so what

526
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,119
the company did is that okay that that's

527
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:32,000
a that's a bacteria that is very good to

528
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,158
colonize the corn Roots so let's modify

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,278
it to make it better at fixing nitrogen

530
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,960
so they they looked at the The genome

531
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:40,880
and then they found a part where where

532
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
it says okay I had enough nitrogen and

533
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,679
they just remove that part so that's

534
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,880
what I learned from working with the

535
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,000
soil

536
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,919
microbiologist and then with this they

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,960
were able to to uh with this then the

538
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,038
process would restart indefinitely and

539
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,558
then just continue fixing nitrogen

540
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,640
Non-Stop and that's the nitrogen that

541
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:00,759
becomes available available for the for

542
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,000
the the

543
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,640
crop okay so

544
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,798
once talk with the Cooperative Extension

545
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,919
people and service providers to learn

546
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,960
okay what people are experimenting then

547
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,840
I consulted with Specialists to learn a

548
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,000
little bit more about the topic and then

549
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:20,720
after that we met with Farmers to

550
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,200
understand and with the specialist in uh

551
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,759
nitrogen and corn and soil to just

552
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,558
generate some questions what are the

553
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,319
questions that will be relevant to

554
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:32,240
understand with this process okay and

555
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,439
the questions that came out are okay

556
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,319
what is the what is the effect on crop

557
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,080
nitrogen status we not just looking at

558
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,158
yield of course we will look at yield

559
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,158
but not just the yield we want to see

560
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,480
does that increase the nitrogen status

561
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,760
of the

562
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,880
crop will the organism be present in the

563
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,359
soil during the season if it's not there

564
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,159
it means it's not doing anything and

565
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,879
Farmers wanted to know is there a link

566
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,720
with some management that I'm doing with

567
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,278
the type of soil with the weather if

568
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,519
it's a drought dry year or a wet year

569
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:08,159
okay so with all that and learning from

570
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,079
um the soil microbiologist on how to

571
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,799
collect transport and store and process

572
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:17,759
the samples uh then we just went and

573
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:20,918
collected a bunch of samples so uh we uh

574
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,599
we identif we met the farmers via the

575
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,520
the CCE and the The

576
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,359
Cooperative Corel Cooperative Extension

577
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,119
and the service provider to have some

578
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,439
address some name some some phone

579
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,398
numbers so we contacted them and then

580
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,519
those Farmers explained to us okay what

581
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,278
is my experimental design where is the

582
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,079
field they met with us in the field

583
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,558
there's a flag there from here to there

584
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:45,359
you see so so that that that was that

585
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,200
was a little bit of a cumbersome process

586
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,839
to be honest but uh we were able to see

587
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,399
where their experimentations were were

588
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,480
taking place and if you look at this

589
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,000
here it's a little bit all over the

590
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,759
place so you see normal strip trial

591
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,079
alternative strips side by side so this

592
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,759
is very common how Farmers experiment

593
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,519
just side by side like this um adjacent

594
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,960
field so they kind of assume that those

595
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,038
fields are very comparable so they would

596
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,519
they would test this we even saw that

597
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,440
one Edge Rose we know very well about

598
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,879
the edge effect but still some Farmers I

599
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,880
mean he said like yeah I don't care much

600
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,480
about the the side so uh I'm going to

601
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,760
put the control

602
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,399
there we didn't say like okay that then

603
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,359
we don't engage we said okay let's

604
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:32,439
collect all the that still and when it's

605
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,479
time to analyze it it will become a

606
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,798
confounding factor and then the farmer

607
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,640
will learn from this experience uh

608
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,558
rather than if I would just tell them

609
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,480
like no that doesn't work okay okay so

610
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:47,798
then we went there and with interns

611
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,599
students we um we collected a bunch of

612
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:51,879
samples at every location trying to make

613
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,959
it like very efficient trips uh every

614
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,919
time we went out then uh Phil worked on

615
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,679
a on a process to uh to simplify y

616
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,038
gather retrieving all sorts of public

617
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,600
domain information such as uh pre like

618
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,519
the weather data remote sensing imagery

619
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:14,000
drought index topography and then soil

620
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,278
series okay so just by delineating the

621
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,240
the boundaries of the field then all the

622
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,440
data is aggregated so now we have this

623
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,038
to contextualize those

624
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,440
observations um and then this part was

625
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,679
was tricky we went and consulted with

626
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,759
the farmers to know like what did you do

627
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,480
what did you do in this field all the

628
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,759
the the step uh from planting to harvest

629
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,038
and cover crops and we had all sorts of

630
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,079
things there there and we had to do a

631
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:43,319
lot of back and forth to um to get that

632
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,918
information as accurate as possible but

633
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,439
it was all on paper and it was a little

634
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,200
bit tricky and then we processed those

635
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,278
samples the soil root

636
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,480
samples uh to detect uh the the presence

637
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,679
and the presence of the bacteria using

638
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,960
the bacteria using

639
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,480
qpcr okay so now we had like a mountain

640
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,519
of data okay from all the context data

641
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,558
all those agronomic sample data all the

642
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,480
data that came from filling out those

643
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:14,319
fields I'm this is digital Agronomy

644
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,519
right there it's just like a pile of

645
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,480
data we wanted to say okay how do we

646
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,839
present this to the farmer so that they

647
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,038
learn something I mean at that point it

648
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,639
felt more like man we're going to

649
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,200
confuse them more than anything else so

650
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,679
what we thought is like okay let's

651
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,919
transform every TW data into something

652
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,320
that looks more like an infographic and

653
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,320
that can be uh that is more like a

654
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,558
graphic that can be analyz briefly and

655
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,599
simply okay so each data we generated

656
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:47,079
infographic so I'm not going to go too

657
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,719
much in depth on this um but for each

658
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,720
piece of data we had some something like

659
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,679
that so here I mean it's not so easy but

660
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,679
you have the treatment versus the

661
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,440
control and then we would be able to do

662
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,240
like distribution curve okay like fairly

663
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,640
simple the yield coming from the

664
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
treatment the yield coming from the

665
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,880
control are they perfectly overlapping

666
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,359
is there a shift is there difference

667
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,200
okay then here that data here is a

668
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,319
little bit trickier to understand but

669
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,558
this is the nitrogen versus the yield

670
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,720
potential and what it shows is that here

671
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:20,558
you are in the response part of the

672
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,440
curve so more nitrogen equals more yield

673
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,359
and here you are in the flat part so

674
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,038
more nitrogen doesn't change anything so

675
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,079
what we wanted to Farmers to see like

676
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,278
hey if you're here and you put 40 uh 40

677
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,960
units less more or less it's not going

678
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,558
to change your yield okay so that that

679
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,319
was an important piece of information

680
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:42,158
then after that trying to see like okay

681
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:45,319
how can we illustrate the qpcr

682
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,278
results so we draw like really how did

683
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,359
where and how we collected the samples

684
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,240
and then we did an infographic with this

685
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,079
so that they can quickly see is there a

686
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,000
bar or there's nothing there I don't see

687
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:58,798
any any uh any any data from that then

688
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,880
after that remote sens thing helps us

689
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,599
like see like is there special

690
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,039
variability in the field and then the

691
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,798
weather data showing like uh it's maybe

692
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,798
a little bit easier to see here but them

693
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,000
versus the the rest of the group and

694
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,918
then you can start seeing okay was was

695
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,240
there drought in in during that year was

696
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,440
it a dry year or it was a normal year or

697
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,120
then you can can start seeing it then

698
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,798
another piece of information that we

699
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,199
wanted to add was benchmarking how did

700
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:29,558
your field so you will find something in

701
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,919
terms of your yield presentence of the

702
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:36,158
the bacteria and your nitrogen status

703
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:38,278
but how is this com how when you get

704
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
this information how did your management

705
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:42,919
compare to the the other people in the

706
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:46,678
network okay we had 23 Farms so we were

707
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:50,200
able to draw uh box plus like that that

708
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,960
kind of illustrate the entire um group

709
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,679
and with this we can put okay this is

710
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,639
your farm so you can see okay here I had

711
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,600
quite low Growing Degree Days my wheat

712
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,759
pressure was a little bit High I had one

713
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:05,759
of the highest yield in the in the in

714
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:09,240
the the group you see so now you quickly

715
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,000
see by benchmarking with others like how

716
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,960
how things are panning for you where

717
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,519
where where you stand okay so now that

718
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,600
we had like okay those infographic we

719
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:24,440
did not just throw those at them by

720
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:27,000
themselves we provided a key to uh to

721
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,600
help them interpret the results okay so

722
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,599
that they would would go through that

723
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,839
key flip through the pages and then see

724
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:36,119
okay this is how I interpret this uh

725
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,959
this result and with this they would be

726
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,558
able to get to a conclusion for each of

727
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,679
their site okay remember that it's a

728
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:47,319
side by side you don't have

729
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,278
replications uh it's one year okay so

730
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,200
you have really one one thing to look at

731
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,960
and from this you want to to conclude

732
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,240
something of course it's not going to be

733
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,000
a scientific conclusion but what we're

734
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,159
trying to do is to um

735
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
stack layers of evidence that kind of

736
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,399
all point in the same direction if you

737
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,759
have 10 things pointing in the same

738
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,038
directions conclusions are stronger if

739
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,359
everything is all over the place

740
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:14,240
conclusions are weaker okay that that

741
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,439
kind of approach that's what the data

742
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,000
allows you to do so okay so we went

743
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,798
through the the yield first that was the

744
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,359
most important question for them then

745
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,599
nutrition index and then was the the

746
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,079
bacteria in the field or not and for

747
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,638
each of those they would mark

748
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:34,439
if it was very clear or it was Fuzzy in

749
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:36,558
their interpretation just to allow them

750
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,840
to yeah this is something decide

751
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:41,038
something because if if you have to be

752
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,599
perfectly clear it's better to have a

753
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,359
conclusion with a level of certainty

754
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,158
than nothing at all

755
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,798
okay uh and then with this we would we

756
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,760
would generate a conclusion and a level

757
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,480
of

758
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,398
confidence so it looked a little bit the

759
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,159
results were a little bit all over the

760
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,398
place but here what I wanted to show is

761
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,480
that um in general there's a good

762
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:07,319
agreement between very simple just

763
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,919
looking at yield and adding more data

764
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:13,278
but what it does here is that when you

765
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,080
see something like hey it didn't work it

766
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:19,319
didn't work for me if you have uh more

767
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:23,638
data what it allows you to do is that

768
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:26,319
you can learn why you are allows you to

769
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:28,079
to ask question why it maybe didn't work

770
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,200
because if you just have it didn't work

771
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,398
for me then you may just ditch it and

772
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,798
never return again but if you're trying

773
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,000
something new if you understand why it

774
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,319
didn't work now you're kind of willing

775
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,638
to give it another goal maybe the

776
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,319
following year or to kind of pursue uh

777
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:44,839
the learning

778
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,398
process um okay and then that allows us

779
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,398
to kind of see at the at the at the

780
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,518
network level to understand a little bit

781
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:56,158
more what's going on and I'm going to go

782
00:33:52,519 --> 00:34:01,200
uh briefly over this here

783
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:03,039
um uh so Phil uh Ed AI to try to

784
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,600
understand a little bit what's going on

785
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:09,358
in the data okay so we looked at what

786
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,358
the at the presence of the bacteria KV

787
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,398
and then we just drew like all the

788
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:18,199
variables try to see what could explain

789
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:20,440
the presence absence or the the the

790
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,799
level basically and then we saw like

791
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,800
okay it's inversely related with the

792
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,000
other bacteria so there are two bacteria

793
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,720
in that in that cocktail if one bacteria

794
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,679
picks up then the other one kind is kind

795
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,199
of recessed and vice versa so that was

796
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,159
kind of interesting and that would

797
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,078
explain why they put two uh but then

798
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,320
there was a bunch of things that some

799
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,200
make sense organic matters some are

800
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,639
maybe a little bit harder to under to

801
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,838
interpret but then what this

802
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,800
does is that it could be so some of

803
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,960
those it's easy to dismiss yeah it does

804
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,480
like a giving an agronomic diagnosis of

805
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,039
that of that kind of data you can see

806
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,918
yeah no that doesn't make sense and

807
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,480
working with Farmers also they can

808
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,960
quickly see things that make or don't

809
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,960
make sense um but what it does is that

810
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,960
things that we don't have a clear answer

811
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,320
why is this so

812
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,440
impactful uh then it could generate new

813
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,000
hypothesis for research is there

814
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,679
something about the slope something

815
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,920
about the calcium that could change

816
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:20,759
something in in the the abundance of the

817
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,000
the bacteria in the soil so I mean if we

818
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,000
had like a conversation with specialist

819
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,880
we could dismiss some of those but some

820
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,519
of those things coming up we could could

821
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,160
investigate further so I wanted to touch

822
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:37,039
on this because this process here is is

823
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,480
a is kind of powerful for problem

824
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,599
finding for generating new hypothesis

825
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,719
instead of generating your research

826
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,320
hypothesis based on uh farmer that

827
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,279
points at something that they s in their

828
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,359
field that's kind of interesting but now

829
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,160
we have a new process that says like hey

830
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,279
this is happening we see that

831
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,879
consistently over the years over the

832
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,880
fields we don't understand why there's

833
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,440
such a strong relation here oh now

834
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,119
that's a new kind of interesting

835
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,880
research project to

836
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,519
start okay um so we wanted to learn from

837
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,480
that first iteration of un Farm

838
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,318
experimentation so yeah we learned that

839
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,440
farmers appreciate this way of

840
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:19,079
collaborating and were engaged basically

841
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,280
they were doing it either if we were

842
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,280
there or not okay the engagement was

843
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,119
really to exchange the data and then

844
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,880
work together to interpret the results

845
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,920
data change was a mess okay the flow

846
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,559
this is a very slow flow that was that

847
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,720
was not uh that was not easy H and the

848
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,759
conclusions with data are what we see is

849
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,799
that they are more nuanced and they

850
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,640
raise questions so ideally it would be

851
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,240
very clear for Farmers what they learn

852
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,920
from from their experimentation but the

853
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,199
reality is that when you do a side by

854
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,358
side you cannot have the same level of

855
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,639
certainty that when you do

856
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,960
a scientific experimentation

857
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:03,480
but yet you can learn

858
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,960
something okay so this kind of fueled

859
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,760
the the the the second wave of

860
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,240
development if we are going to do

861
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,880
another cycle of unarm experimentation

862
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,519
let's be more prepared to make it a

863
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,480
little bit more easy because by the time

864
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,639
we started the first the first project

865
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,800
and the time that we had all the results

866
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,440
ready it took two year because it was

867
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,519
such a mess to go through and it was

868
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,599
like a learning learning process the

869
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,639
idea here is that we need to be involved

870
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,960
being able to kind of make it happen

871
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,960
quick so that we can do a full cycle in

872
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,358
one year so let's try to develop tools

873
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,760
that will help us do that one of those

874
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,719
tools to quickly learn and to maybe

875
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,960
allow for a little bit more diversity on

876
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,439
what and how Farmers want to learn is

877
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,599
the experimentation card the experiment

878
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,318
card we're basically asking okay what is

879
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,119
your hypothesis how are you going to

880
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:55,838
test your hypothesis what are you going

881
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,318
to measure and how are you going to

882
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,679
interpret those measurement

883
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,838
it could be very simple but at least it

884
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,118
kind of puts on paper a little bit of

885
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,000
more

886
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:09,920
um more motivated or more uh practical

887
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,719
way to to experiment for them it helps

888
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,240
them like crystallize this on paper then

889
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,199
we are working on the development of a

890
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,159
of dashboard and this will allow us to

891
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,639
better capture the data so we want to

892
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,719
build

893
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,279
a a web tool that will allow Farmers to

894
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,000
say like okay I'm dedicated to

895
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,319
experiment in that one plot they would

896
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,159
not do this for their entire Farm but

897
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,519
I'm experimenting in that one plot I

898
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,559
have scientists from Cornell from

899
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,318
different groups coming in helping me to

900
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,078
to extract the information and learn

901
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:43,679
more from that thing so our hope is that

902
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
they will be willing to spend a little

903
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,919
bit time at night to kind of populate

904
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,400
and explain what they did in the form of

905
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,760
a timeline so they would just add every

906
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,440
operation that they did during the

907
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,079
season for that one uh field and then

908
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,159
with this we will have access directly

909
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,359
to all the the the detail information

910
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,399
then we are starting a uh a survey on on

911
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,239
Farm experimentation and digitalization

912
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,079
so we want to learn a little bit more

913
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,078
there's one survey that exists and it

914
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,119
said that 90% of farmers were

915
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,960
experimenting but now we want to see

916
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,880
okay is this does that hold for New York

917
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
and then learn a little bit more about

918
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,599
that process like what kind of data they

919
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,960
collect and uh how they interpret it so

920
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,800
uh yes so ktie Ellison and M will be

921
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,400
collaborating in this project so this is

922
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,119
this is great and then we have a new

923
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,280
website coming up Farmers that lab that

924
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,880
where we want to kind of centralize both

925
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,200
the information about what is this

926
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,800
process but also a way to get engaged

927
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,799
into for Farmers to to work with us just

928
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,240
wanted to touch here that the next round

929
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,200
of on Farm experimentation next summer

930
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,799
will be on adjusting nitrogen rates in

931
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,960
corn after cover crops uh so this

932
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,318
project was funded by the New York corn

933
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,039
and so being grower associations and in

934
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:04,358
collaboration with American Farmland

935
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,358
trust so that uh that's nice because

936
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:08,039
when we presented the the project I

937
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,799
presented it this way like we want to

938
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:13,159
help farmers derious their their

939
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
experimentation and learn more from it

940
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,399
and the growers association I mean they

941
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,239
they like the idea and they funded it so

942
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,880
that was kind of a good um that was a

943
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,199
positive thing for the program okay so

944
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,039
now I just want to uh to uh finish or or

945
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,000
to to conclude on

946
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,679
how I see that this could become like a

947
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,159
little bit of a like a vision for the

948
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:37,279
future if we are able to scale this

949
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,118
process okay so we have Farmers here

950
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,280
that are after pragmatic knowledge they

951
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,599
want to find things that work they don't

952
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,160
necessarily understand why the same

953
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,960
thing as when they developed the three

954
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,519
sisters they may not have understood

955
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,039
exactly how the beans were fixing

956
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,960
nitrogen it was just pragmatic it works

957
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,759
for them okay this is this is what

958
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,760
farmers are looking for

959
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,960
then we have academic research where

960
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,839
we're looking for semantic knowledge

961
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,480
something that is general knowledge that

962
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,639
can be uh Universal okay that's what

963
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,920
we're looking

964
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,239
for in this part here we have

965
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,440
observational research so it's all

966
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,719
anecdotes that are transform into

967
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,960
scientific piece of observation that can

968
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,959
be used in the database for analysis and

969
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,039
this way we can uh find Trends and

970
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,119
patterns in the data generated here

971
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,400
while here we are uh developing the

972
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,240
experimental design so that we can run

973
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,720
statistics and uh

974
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,439
quantify and quantify the processes and

975
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,480
explain like cality and better

976
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,519
understand so the idea here would be

977
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,280
that those two would work together both

978
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,719
are very important for the acceleration

979
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,720
and the transition to a sustainable egg

980
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:52,399
and how it could work is that with this

981
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,039
here we could generate hypothesis as I

982
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,800
was saying okay maybe something

983
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:58,239
sometimes we see something that is very

984
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,680
strong but we don't understand why so

985
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,358
that becomes an an hypothesis for

986
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:06,318
research I want to say here also is that

987
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:09,559
if that if we just spin that wheel

988
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,719
without the connection here maybe we

989
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,599
will find something that works but if we

990
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:16,759
don't understand it maybe over time like

991
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,240
in 20 years 30 years Boom the thing will

992
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,880
break and then we don't understand why

993
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,679
because we did not have a clear

994
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,358
understanding of the processes behind

995
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,399
that's why the connection is super

996
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:27,639
important but then here academic

997
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,039
research provid

998
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:31,838
an understanding so that yeah we can we

999
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,279
can roll with with that pragmatic

1000
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,880
knowledge and really continue the

1001
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,920
progress and Accel accelerate the

1002
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,599
progress and in this way back to my

1003
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,400
title that's why I I think farmers will

1004
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,318
will lead the transition because when in

1005
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
this process uh farmers are leading the

1006
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:52,000
the

1007
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,679
experimentation the exploration process

1008
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,400
okay so people that are making this

1009
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,960
possible I mean I had I did not realize

1010
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,240
before putting that slide together that

1011
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,519
so many people were involved this is

1012
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:07,039
this is awesome uh so grad students Alex

1013
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:09,639
Phil KT and then all the interns uh that

1014
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,159
were with us over the years I mean

1015
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,199
during the season I mean when we are

1016
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,558
going to on all those fields of having a

1017
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,558
big team allows us to just like hop from

1018
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,800
one one field to the other and be very

1019
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:24,599
efficient and then collaborators to the

1020
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,960
program uh and funding here uh with

1021
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,318
Cornell AES USDA at kinson C New York

1022
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,440
Growers and soybean

1023
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,639
Association okay so if you want to learn

1024
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,838
more and I'm going to stop on this uh

1025
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,639
there's an an important paper that was

1026
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,639
kind of explaining the whole all the

1027
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:44,039
principles of onar experimentation and

1028
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:47,440
how it can transform Global agriculture

1029
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:50,279
uh we are putting out every month a

1030
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,559
newsletter on the topic of unarm

1031
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,280
experimentation via the international

1032
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:59,720
Society of PR act and uh we are also so

1033
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,519
putting together a new uh Network called

1034
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:02,879
the Gan the global on Farm

1035
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,880
experimentation

1036
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,200
network uh so that we can all share

1037
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,960
tools knowledge develop the science and

1038
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:12,960
organize it's a little bit like a

1039
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,119
society so M and I are kind of leading

1040
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,720
this this initiative so thank you very

1041
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,240
much for your

1042
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:23,879
attention have five minutes for

1043
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:26,439
questions David is said David first I'm

1044
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,480
wondering about the balance in the

1045
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,358
driver behind on Farm experimentation so

1046
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,559
as an example you know pivot bio is

1047
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:38,199
advertising on country radio stations

1048
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,359
every five minutes but you know maybe

1049
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:44,039
Herold can't afford an advertisement

1050
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,719
every five minutes for soci health or

1051
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:50,119
you know internationally like jaica was

1052
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:53,480
always pushing effective microorganism

1053
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:56,440
as part of their development mandate but

1054
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,240
maybe conventional convention

1055
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,440
conventional extensionist didn't have

1056
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,759
that option that budget y so if the

1057
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,440
driver for on Farm experimentation is

1058
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,720
driven by a commercial entity to the

1059
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,318
disfavor of research generated how do

1060
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,159
you address that this is this is a great

1061
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:17,440
question okay so we went with the pivot

1062
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:20,920
bio

1063
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,119
experiment I must say foolishly now

1064
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:28,000
after after the fact my my uh kind of

1065
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,960
thinking that was that okay I like the

1066
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,280
idea that nitrogen comes from from a

1067
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,679
bacteria bacteria rather than coming

1068
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,400
from natural gas so that was kind of

1069
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,960
okay so this could be a sustainable

1070
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,519
thing because I mean we can pick and

1071
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,760
choose the experiments that we want to

1072
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:48,519
to to to support so right so that was

1073
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:52,319
kind of okay with the principles behind

1074
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,519
the farmers that I have okay so then I

1075
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,119
felt like okay this is could be fairly

1076
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:00,719
simple it's kind of you apply

1077
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:04,640
treatment versus control so that will

1078
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:07,118
make for kind of a simple uh learning uh

1079
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,480
um learning experience as compared to

1080
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,519
maybe working more with cover crops or

1081
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,000
no tail where you can have like a some a

1082
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,480
lot of diversity between the control and

1083
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,440
the treatment so we wanted to go with

1084
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,960
something simple but uh you you are

1085
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,280
right that we cannot just respond to

1086
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,318
like everything that is going on so one

1087
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,640
thing so to to

1088
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:34,039
the the solution or maybe the the the

1089
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,838
way to to work with this is to uh rather

1090
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,239
than taking everything that is coming

1091
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,960
our way what however it is is to kind of

1092
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:43,799
be more uh purpose oriented for what we

1093
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,679
choose so one thing that I'm thinking to

1094
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,880
do is when we do those experiment card

1095
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,719
we may have topics start with topics and

1096
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,318
topics that are related to actually the

1097
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:58,838
science that we know we know

1098
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,838
work that we want to kind of push

1099
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,118
but that's that's

1100
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,519
important and then David so um two quick

1101
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,838
questions um I hope that experiment that

1102
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:15,358
involved the uh the

1103
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:17,599
enros um was thrown out because that you

1104
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,799
know I mean I I get your point that you

1105
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,680
know that's how the Farms do it but you

1106
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,640
got to throw out data that's yeah

1107
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,558
because head goes always on theform but

1108
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,358
the other question that I have is is is

1109
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,480
did

1110
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,679
when you say would bu a work like in 24%

1111
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,079
of the cases what does that mean that it

1112
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,078
worked was did it economically work

1113
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,359
because you're charging quite a bit yeah

1114
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,079
for uh product actually given an

1115
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,558
economic advantage and have you then

1116
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,800
made an aggregate analysis if it only

1117
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,800
works in one out of four cases and you

1118
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,880
pay what was it $20 or something like

1119
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,680
that per acre like how does a pencil out

1120
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,519
yes yes okay this is a good point I mean

1121
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,239
how we determine that it works

1122
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,280
is that with increased yield you were in

1123
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,679
the response curve of nitrogen and the

1124
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,640
organism was present that's what we

1125
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:10,719
could deal with but you're right that we

1126
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:14,480
don't know if it was uh economically

1127
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:17,279
viable uh with I mean we have yet to

1128
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,800
kind of dig into the data to uh to to

1129
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,440
extract all the information and you're

1130
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,720
right that some some fields we could we

1131
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,960
could not work with with some

1132
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:28,879
experimental sites so what I showed at

1133
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,800
the end was just 16 Fields out of the 23

1134
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,519
because some that are just not good

1135
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,480
enough and actually 16 is not much to

1136
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,719
try to look for Trends and

1137
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,559
patterns much better than zero yeah

1138
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,639
better than zero but like the idea is to

1139
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,119
to find tool so that we can kind of

1140
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,960
scale because the the power really comes

1141
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,318
when you have

1142
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,039
numbers my question is how you get the

1143
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,400
confidence that you had there you have

1144
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,639
your interpretation tree and each one

1145
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,720
you had a little you know how in the

1146
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,719
heck I sta

1147
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:07,119
how did youate yeah so we part we start

1148
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,200
from the premise that farmers uh they

1149
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,200
they are used to look at their yield and

1150
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,039
decide

1151
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:16,679
something uh but in this case you have

1152
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,639
the data in front of you so we did not

1153
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:21,318
do stats because we cannot really do

1154
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,039
stats so what we did is that we uh we

1155
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,079
just you just look at the data and you

1156
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,199
decide so that's the farmers themselves

1157
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,559
deciding if they find that this is

1158
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,279
convincing or not because in the end the

1159
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:35,920
conclusion will serve

1160
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,798
them I mean this because you see the

1161
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,720
idea back to pre Fisher though I mean

1162
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:41,599
this is

1163
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:44,078
1924 something the pile of potatoes and

1164
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,880
the other pile of potatoes yes but in

1165
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,519
this case we at a certain point want

1166
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,680
statistics we know that we're really see

1167
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,358
something that's true not just

1168
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,879
somebody's opinion yes so in this case

1169
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:57,920
we were looking at

1170
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,838
heal pretty sure you're looking at heal

1171
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,240
and this is not I want to work with you

1172
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,960
on this okay so what I think we can

1173
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,399
solve this when you cannot conduct

1174
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,079
statistics statistics is that with the

1175
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,880
data you can have multiple signals I

1176
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:16,039
kind of touch a little bit on this and

1177
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,000
um you will never be able to have like a

1178
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:22,239
95% certainty about your conclusion what

1179
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,159
you will be able is to to have something

1180
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,358
that will hint you for the for the

1181
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,078
subsequent Seasons to to make a decision

1182
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,558
to move on to learn something from your

1183
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:35,119
experiment and what I think is that if

1184
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,319
you have maybe two three four five

1185
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,960
signals and the more independent those

1186
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:42,279
signals are if they all point in the

1187
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,358
same direction then that strengthen the

1188
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,839
the conclusion if they are in different

1189
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:49,920
direction then it's weakens the conion

1190
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:52,798
so it's a little bit of a paradigm

1191
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,480
shift we because we have to work with

1192
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:57,480
the data that that exists

1193
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:05,239
this has been a production of Cornell

1194
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,239
University on the web at cornell.edu
