1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,320
&gt;&gt; Cercidiphyllum japonicum or Katsura tree,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,110
a large tree also needing water.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,630
It has beautiful heart-shaped leaves and it is

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,179
sub opposite - so it's not quite opposite,

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,359
not quite alternate, but just off of opposite.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,629
In the fall as the leaves start to turn

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,640
they exude a sugary smell something like cotton candy.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,940
This is Katsura tree or Cercidiphyllum japonicum.
