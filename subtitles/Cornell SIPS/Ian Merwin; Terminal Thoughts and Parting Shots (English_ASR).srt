1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
here this is called protect your bald

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,759
head hat is what this

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:16,799
is so what we're going to do

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
mike brown who is my

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
this guy is the best research support

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,239
specialist

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
thank you certainly in new york state

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,239
possibly in the northeast

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,879
uh mike has been really my right-hand

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,079
man for

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,039
what 12 years 13 years

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,320
and greg was also involved in and quite

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,640
a bit of the work that we're going to

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
look at so i want them both to come with

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
me

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,119
and um we're going to just do a quick

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,000
walk through

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,878
because it doesn't look like it's going

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,558
to rain

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
we're going to go through the orchard up

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,959
here and greg i'm hoping you can talk

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,799
since this is greg's phd

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
and then we'll swing through and i'll

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,119
talk a little bit about apple replant

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
work and and then we'll probably come

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,878
back so we're just gonna

29
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,320
it's full bloom we gotta have an excuse

30
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,799
to walk in the orchard so let's go

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
this way

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,439
so this was uh greg's phd

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,040
planning so i'm gonna i want greg to do

34
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
most of talking

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,479
a little bit of the history of it uh

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
this is liberty which is

37
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,840
a lot of people consider it the most

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,000
disease-resistant apple that's ever been

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,359
developed it's a cornell

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,478
apple uh has mccown and a bunch of other

41
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,879
stuff in its parentage and uh

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,560
rick risinger rick's not here but he was

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
a really key person that i worked with

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,719
during the 90s most of the trees that

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,359
you see

46
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,000
except for those i think rick planted it

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,078
was fabulous having an orchard manager

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,519
who was as much of a fanatic as i was

49
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,559
about planning new stuff

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,158
and and seeing how it did so we planted

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
this in 1994

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
just because we wanted to have some scab

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,279
immune stuff here

54
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,759
and uh to work with so greg why don't

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,599
you

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,800
tell us about this sure you got a holler

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,840
so this is a whole plot it's about um

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
about an acre or so it's all liberty on

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,598
m9 a dwarfing rootstock

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
and it was planted here for different

61
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,159
purposes and actually uh

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,759
the summer before i came in ian had two

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,359
undergraduate students

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,120
emily vollmer and christine avril

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
started on a project here looking at

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,879
organic systems and

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,759
integrated fruit production which is the

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,759
conventional system in europe um to the

69
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,878
state really which is a low input

70
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,359
soft uh program integrating uh

71
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,280
insect control and nutrient management

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
and water management into a system and

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,439
so

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,039
the goal of the project was to really

75
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,479
look at can we do organic

76
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,400
here in the northeast which is very

77
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,840
difficult with the large

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,239
pest complex that we have 50 some odd

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,598
arthropod pests and another

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
20 different fungi and bacteria and

81
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,318
other

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,439
other disease agents that that really

83
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,199
are uh

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,039
difficult to control even the

85
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
conventional system but can we do an

86
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,719
organic system and also let's look at

87
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,079
this european system this ifp

88
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,120
system so we had four replications of

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
each of the treatments

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,759
in this plot here and i ran the study

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
for we had four years of data on it

92
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,798
and looked at everything from soil

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
ecology

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
through productivity of the trees fruit

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,039
quality

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,119
nutraceutical content of the fruit

97
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
consumer sensory panels

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
environmental impacts it was a very

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,079
holistic sort of project

100
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,598
and we saw wrote the publication that

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,319
ian showed as well out of the

102
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,839
out of the organic side of the work here

103
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
long and short of it is that

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
yeah you can do organic if the premium

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,719
is high enough to get the return on

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
investment

107
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,479
which is required for the additional

108
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,518
pest pest control practices that you

109
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,318
need to do

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
and the loss of fruit somewhat smaller

111
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,479
fruit size that you get

112
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,079
and the additional hand labor but um but

113
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,359
it's doable and it's an economic

114
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,159
question more than a

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
than a feasibility question even with

116
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,519
that though

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
hasn't really taken off we were hoping

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
you know maybe some people would be

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
interested in

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,839
i know anecdotally there's some still

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
some experimentation with organic

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,519
in the northeast but we'll see where the

123
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239
future is

124
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,159
the ifp system has largely been

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
incorporated into new systems such as

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
the gap

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
the uh

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,040
cultural practices uh systems that are

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
now that the supermarkets the retailers

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
are really requiring for the growers so

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
slowly that's becoming the standard here

132
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,839
as it as it has in europe as well

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,439
so um yeah i spent a lot of time out

134
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,799
here it's probably the most micromanaged

135
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
organic plots in

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,879
in the northeast at the time and is it

137
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,560
still being managed organically

138
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,319
is actually the whole block is now

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
down to the edge and we have the nothing

140
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,519
eric inspector here

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
when was that eric a year ago about and

142
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,719
they looked at it and basically said no

143
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,359
problem if you want to certify it

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,199
this is one of the few organic

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,879
comparisons with other systems that was

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
actually replicated

147
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,159
uh instead of pseudo-replicated where

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
you're comparing this farm to that farm

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,120
and it actually worked really well i

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,079
think it was a good experimental design

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,959
that we had set here

152
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,918
so this is the only planning i've ever

153
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,439
managed

154
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,959
that i've gotten a call from

155
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,399
environmental health and safety and said

156
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,079
what the hell are you guys doing out

157
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,079
there it smells like there's a bunch of

158
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,800
dead fish

159
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,159
and that's because the thinning

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,079
treatment that we use here

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:50,000
is lime sulfur and crocker's fish oil

162
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,800
and it it's uh if you've driven in here

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,478
in the summer

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
this whole thing is whitewashed that's

165
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,478
the surround very effective organic

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,879
insect repellent and the thinning that

167
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,199
we do

168
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,120
is lime sulfur was combination of dead

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
fish and rotten eggs it's great stuff to

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
work with

171
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,599
i describe it as jersey shore and

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
apologies to those who were from the

173
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
jersey shore

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,440
but uh it smells like that just

175
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,639
coincidentally and every year it turned

176
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,160
out this way and i didn't do it on

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
purpose but it always turned out i had

178
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
to put that application on a

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,038
commencement weekend

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
i don't know it just turned out that way

181
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,839
yeah i'm i you know i'm a believer in

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,478
quitting while you're ahead

183
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,478
hey taryn

184
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,359
i want you to talk about your root boxes

185
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
just a little bit you got a holler oh

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,038
man

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,319
i'll stand i'll stand here okay we can

188
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:49,759
i wish well i wish we had one open um

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,800
so well these are root boxes as ian

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,720
mentioned they are basically um if we

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
could pull the lid off of

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
one of these what you would find inside

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,038
is basically

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
uh mylar sheets on each side

195
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,038
of these root boxes so that we can

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,598
actually observe

197
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,560
the roots growing against them over time

198
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,839
the problem with apples is that

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,478
unlike almost every other tree crop

200
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,079
plant i've ever worked with they have

201
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,639
such a minimal root system

202
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,399
compared comparatively and so we have a

203
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
really actually difficult time

204
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,959
finding roots on these trees and so

205
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
these are installed about a year ago

206
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,279
or so now but it'll be exciting this

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,598
spring to open them up and

208
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,038
and see what we found um last year when

209
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,159
we checked them there was hardly

210
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,000
anything there and it was somewhat

211
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,919
disappointing but

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,279
fingers across for this year and

213
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,879
hopefully we'll find something are they

214
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,439
worse than grapes

215
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,959
much worse grapes have like 10 times as

216
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,000
many roots

217
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,279
the poster child

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,120
yeah we had i think we had uh

219
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,719
60 observation to how many do we have

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,199
out here mike when we had the rhizotron

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
tubes

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,879
was it 60. and uh

223
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
the work when shangri was coming doing

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
weekly observations

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,879
i think we only ended up with something

226
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,560
like 80 roots and the whole damn orchard

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,800
that happened to be next to the tube

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
i mean you actually made me kind of

229
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
nervous when the wind blows i think

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
the orchard's just going to blow away

231
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
because they don't have much of a root

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
system

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,080
sometimes i'm amazed at how apples uh

234
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
do it with such a minimal root system i

235
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,839
don't it's amazing yeah they must be

236
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,839
incredibly mycorrhizal with all i can

237
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,158
say yeah yeah and the roots

238
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,439
are steady the ones they do have are

239
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,599
pretty active i think

240
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,599
yes

241
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,759
uh this the question was what's the root

242
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,200
stock

243
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,958
there's six different root stocks here

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
so this is the replant experiment that i

245
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,239
was talking about in there

246
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,159
the old tree rows went this way and

247
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,278
the pre-plant treatments went this way

248
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,879
and they're blocked

249
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:58,000
five times from east to west

250
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,200
and then the so there were four

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
pre-plant treatments you remember

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
blocked

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
wrapped five times by the blocks and

254
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,679
then each tree

255
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,560
basically is they've all got well most

256
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:12,000
of them still have tags

257
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,119
they it's a each tree is a replica

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,958
of the factorial combination so

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
and it's been pretty stunning uh the

260
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,799
differences

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
even now i mean that that even after

262
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,240
what

263
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,240
10 years i guess right it was 2001 when

264
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
we actually planted these trees

265
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
they just they're not converging at all

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,120
and usually in a replant study

267
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,239
where people have looked at fumigation

268
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,639
as a treatment

269
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
you get this big difference for three or

270
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,600
four years

271
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
where the trees in fumigated ground are

272
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
just bigger and more productive

273
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,039
and then after about 10 years they kind

274
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,480
of come together and that has not

275
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,439
happened with these rootstocks

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
so it's pretty amazing yeah this was for

277
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,720
me

278
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
for 20 years you know i would work on

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
replant and it was all totally empirical

280
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,759
we'd do something

281
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,519
and then we'd come back and we'd measure

282
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,958
how the trees grew or how much fruit

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
they produced or how much

284
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,759
nitrogen they took up and this was the

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,480
first time we ever said you know what i

286
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,919
want to know

287
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,440
why are they doing what they're doing it

288
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,199
was really the one of the first

289
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
mechanistic and it was great being able

290
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
to work with janice

291
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
and having grad students you know greg

292
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,239
also

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,919
did a fair amount of molecular work and

294
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,399
the liberty there

295
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,639
for me it was a it was a big step to

296
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,799
just sort of make that transition to

297
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,919
i used to be one of those somewhat of a

298
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,120
luddite i guess

299
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,599
where you know we all used to make nasty

300
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,839
remarks about molecular biologists and

301
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,278
you know how they weren't doing anything

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
useful but it's

303
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,360
i've really come to realize that was

304
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,879
pretty stupid because the truth is

305
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
it's just they're just techniques and

306
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,480
they're incredibly powerful techniques

307
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
that you can apply in agricultural

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
systems

309
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
that enable you to understand what's

310
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
what's happening why it's happening how

311
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,399
it's happening it's

312
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
it's really powerful stuff so if you're

313
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,679
a student

314
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,440
and you think oh this is not my cup of

315
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
tea

316
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
i always great can the test and i told

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
my students you're going to learn how to

318
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,759
apply this

319
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,679
these techniques while you're here

320
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,838
because you're it's crazy if you don't

321
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,838
so

322
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,679
most orientalists let's keep so they

323
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,720
could walking

324
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,719
uh used in breeding groups oh yeah

325
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
yeah i mean we published that all that

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,759
stuff

327
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
threatened to lie down in front of the

328
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,838
bulldozer when our

329
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
our various people wanted to get rid of

330
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,079
these trees over the years these are the

331
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,320
oldest trees in the whole orchard

332
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,439
19 actually we don't know the truth of

333
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,640
the matter is we didn't keep very good

334
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,160
records in this orchard

335
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,600
we don't even know exactly when the

336
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,519
first trees were planted here we think

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,278
it was around 1908 or 1909

338
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,639
but these trees are probably from the

339
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,838
early 1920s

340
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,679
i suppose where's ken some

341
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
we need a dendrochronologist out here

342
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,078
actually to to take something

343
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,240
from before take a core and tell us

344
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,199
exactly when these trees were planted so

345
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,120
we we keep them around the the guys in

346
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,959
the crew understandably or

347
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,879
it's a lot of work i actually used to

348
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,000
prune these with my orchard management

349
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,320
class

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
until the risk assessment people said

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
you know maybe

352
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
you shouldn't have students on 18 foot

353
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,239
ladders with chainsaws you know that's

354
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,079
not quite

355
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,759
um but it's it's uh i love having them

356
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,799
here because this this is kind of the

357
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,799
history of the apple

358
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,240
and it's really good for students to be

359
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,719
able to show them

360
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
this is what orchards look like 40 by 40

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
feet

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
uh and the other remarkable thing i mean

363
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,679
look at the bloom this tree is almost

364
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
100 years old and it's just raring to go

365
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,278
so hope springs eternal this is a good

366
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,159
thing to look at when you're about to

367
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,159
retire here right

368
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,278
now these are all grafted on ceiling

369
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
roots

370
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,480
and they're cortlands they're these may

371
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,519
be the oldest living

372
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,959
cortland trees

373
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,720
before it was a name variety yeah

374
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,638
and cortland uh for those who aren't

375
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,040
familiar it's a cornell apple

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
one of the earliest introductions of the

377
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,759
geneva

378
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,278
apple breeding program mccown and

379
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,600
cortland were right back there about the

380
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,838
same era early 1900s

381
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,639
i think 1923 was when kirtland was named

382
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,639
if i remember correctly

383
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
so we'll quickly walk through here

384
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
justine

385
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,240
so i want justine to talk a little bit

386
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,919
about this this vineyard

387
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,278
what would you like to do just tell us

388
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,039
tell us why it's here what do we do with

389
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,120
it all right so

390
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,958
uh this is one of our teaching vineyards

391
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
and we call it the pool block named

392
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,879
after bob poole who was a viticulturist

393
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,920
he was my favorite viticulture geneva

394
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,799
who uh who designed this uh and so

395
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,000
there's a real

396
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,679
mix of stuff um through here at the at

397
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,879
the very far end and i'm suggesting

398
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,559
we're gonna walk that way

399
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,159
there's actually the geneva double

400
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,879
curtain which is a

401
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,278
very good training system that that came

402
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,000
out of uh research at geneva by nelson

403
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,240
charlotte

404
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,159
where he divided the canopy he did all

405
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
the research down in fredonia and those

406
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,639
people are upset

407
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
that it is called the geneva double

408
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
curtain and not the fredonia double

409
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,879
curtains

410
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,399
and seriously it is a difficult topic

411
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,399
down there um

412
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
but it was uh then widely used by the

413
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
concord industry for a long time and for

414
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,079
is starting to fall out of favor now

415
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,278
uh and then he put in a a rotational

416
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,039
program so that

417
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,519
students could work with a very young

418
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,879
vine so we've got concord and cybal

419
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,000
that range from zero to five years uh

420
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,439
and then some uh different uh thousands

421
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
of vines and

422
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
perfume versus killing pruned we've got

423
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
some of

424
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,319
what at the time were bruce's grueling

425
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
selections

426
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
but are now named cultivars so there's

427
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,639
some coral noir

428
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,278
uh through here which was was the

429
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,159
um the seventy number right the new york

430
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,480
seven blue

431
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,919
um plus some older just shown act 2 for

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,159
just shonak one thing we do

433
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,000
and and uh and steve lerch does a lot of

434
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,799
the the working here for teaching

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,799
purposes

436
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,639
is we'll prune the show next to zero

437
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,240
node so no nodes at all so it

438
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
technically shouldn't have any yield

439
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,919
but that crazy felt bar will go six

440
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,760
times in over on zero uh

441
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,919
zero nodes because it's really really

442
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,399
fruitful from the latent bud

443
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,000
uh and then there's a a whole selection

444
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
of table groves

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
uh which era some guys took care of and

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,120
then uh harvest themselves here

447
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
at this store um beautiful beautiful

448
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,959
grapes most of them from

449
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,039
uh the cornell brewing program stuff

450
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,559
like mindset foodless uh is a popular

451
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,439
one in canada

452
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,758
too um so that's what we basically have

453
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
in

454
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
in this block we've got a couple other

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
uh teaching blocks one up on the

456
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
that we call the hilltop block that uh

457
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,519
ian actually planted

458
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,278
and then next to that is a an organic

459
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,919
block actually certified by nofa new

460
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,879
york

461
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,719
um that ian and i and kathy arnick are

462
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,480
enology lecturer who's here somewhere oh

463
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
they're here

464
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,199
um that we planted and we use for a

465
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,199
class there

466
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,039
so i find it my bob poole was

467
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
my nemesis when i decided i wanted to

468
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,159
get involved in

469
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,078
viticulture i said well what can i

470
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,600
contribute i said probably i can help

471
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,519
get some vineyards established because

472
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,079
we had none

473
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,399
and i called bob pool up and said bob

474
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,479
will you tell me what varieties you want

475
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,000
and i want to try to get some plantings

476
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
established for this new program we're

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,039
developing and he said merwin you will

478
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,399
do that over my dead body

479
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,278
and he was furious because he saw

480
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,198
viticulture was geneva's thing and he

481
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:39,600
did not want ithaca to have any of that

482
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,799
action

483
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,639
so so we named the block after him just

484
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,639
this poetic justice i guess right

485
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,359
so but here it is and uh for that's been

486
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,320
great for me the last 10 years i guess

487
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,480
it has been now

488
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,399
i'd gotten to a point in my apple

489
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,399
research where i kind of

490
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,399
accomplished a lot of what i wanted to i

491
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,558
figure i got another 10 good years

492
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,160
what can i do that'll make a difference

493
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,439
and uh it's been

494
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,600
it's been really fabulous we got to hire

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,679
all these great viticulture people we

496
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,240
got to hire kathy to teach

497
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
and i think we've got a really quality

498
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,838
program that's

499
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,519
still in the building and of course now

500
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,359
we're looking for another person will be

501
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,400
primarily a viticulturist

502
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,479
to uh to fill the line that i used to

503
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
have so

504
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,599
and for any home wine makers out there

505
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
we do sell

506
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,359
all the grapes from our student

507
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,798
vineyards um and we can actually press

508
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,079
them here for you and you can have the

509
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,960
juice so you can either have grapes or

510
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,720
have the juice

511
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,558
um so if you're interested keep us in

512
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,558
mind in the fall

513
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,678
and bruce did you get to try the cider

514
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,960
that was in there

515
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,798
no didn't make it over there the uh

516
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
i was amazed how fast it went i must

517
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,879
confess it was it was two gallons of

518
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,038
cider that just vaporized but

519
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
uh the red color for those of you that

520
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,839
did try it

521
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:05,038
actually was noire i had some noire

522
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,879
that i nobody wanted to buy it and i was

523
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,879
looking at it it was kind of starting to

524
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
raise it in my cooler and

525
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
said well you know i'm going to throw

526
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,558
that in the cider and just see what it

527
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,119
does it has

528
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,678
it's a really spicy grape with lots of

529
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,279
color

530
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,798
and i thought it might give the cider

531
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,319
some color and there is just a little

532
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,279
touch in ra that if you know what the

533
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,798
grape smells like

534
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,960
do you think it's detectable right um

535
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
so that was fun i think i'm gonna do it

536
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
again i'm not sure i use an ra i might

537
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
use something that

538
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,279
not quite as pungent but we can sell you

539
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,319
something

540
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,319
yeah i'm sure you can

541
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,839
all right so i think we should probably

542
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
head back

543
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
