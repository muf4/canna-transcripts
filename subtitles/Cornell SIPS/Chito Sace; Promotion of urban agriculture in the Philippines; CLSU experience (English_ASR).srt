1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,700
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
University

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,839
well well it is really a big honor for

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,640
me to be given an opportunity to visit

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,079
Cornell of course Cornell we give this

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,939
University high regard in the

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,500
Philippines especially there in our

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,100
universe

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,698
and share to you what we have been doing

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,699
in the Philippines

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,399
and uh I was also thankful to Dr Matson

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,340
because

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,079
of being patient and how we can get

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,120
through this scholarship this Fellowship

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
during the government

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,058
and now that I'm here I'm so glad to

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,700
meet his team at the kpl

18
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:54,238
and meet everyone and of course share to

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,100
you today what we have in the

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,439
Philippines

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,359
well we have been involved in the

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,519
promotion of urban agriculture in the

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,478
Philippines particularly the technology

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,380
of Hydroponics and aquaponics and

25
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:12,438
greenhouses or benefit culture and uh

26
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,539
a controlled environment control

27
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:18,298
agriculture environment then you know in

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,060
the Philippines investment and funding

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,340
is the very big project

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,978
but we try to

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,159
do whatever we have there locally

32
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:33,438
available materials just to have this

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,439
so to start with I want to

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,019
first talk about myself

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,219
I was born in this little island in the

36
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,618
Philippines

37
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,099
they called

38
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:50,759
it has six uh towns and it is situated

39
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,879
in the central part of the Philippines

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,280
I spent my childhood there actually my

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,239
childhood is not is we are the

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,659
struggling Covenant farming families but

43
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,919
we thank our parents that we they taught

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,380
us how to

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,379
go through with our lives

46
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,019
and I spent my Elementary and high

47
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,400
school in this place I was given an

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,319
opportunity to

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,420
go through central Arizona State

50
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,699
University to take a Bachelor of Science

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,679
in agricultural engineering where I

52
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:27,000
graduated in 1983

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,099
and my study is all about Rice School

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,979
Dance

55
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,079
I also took up master of science in

56
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:38,159
agricultural engineering

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,780
when I graduated in 1989 focusing on the

58
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,919
automation of pressurized segregation

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,979
systems

60
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,839
using soil moisture then I pursued my

61
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,579
PhD in agricultural engineering

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,680
completing it by 2008 focusing on Water

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,540
Management systems for hydroponic

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,800
coniture balance

65
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:00,780
later I was sent to a University of

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,620
Arizona in Tucson

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,780
and I completed a six-month scholarship

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,439
program under Fulbright

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,080
but in 2012 and my study is all about

70
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,680
the integration of freshwater abroad

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,440
in aquaponic systems for tilapia lettuce

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,340
peptoy and cabbage culture

73
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,560
and right now I am here at Cornell with

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,378
this Advanced research and University

75
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,140
lecturing program under Fulbright

76
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:34,139
and I am focusing on the study of on the

77
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,479
effect of pH on the grown and real and

78
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,919
quality and cannot denied content

79
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,919
with drapas

80
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,599
after graduation I went to the Middle

81
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,000
East for six years I became an

82
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,798
agricultural engineer Landscaping

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,158
engineer verification engineer doing

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,799
everything there in the desert

85
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:59,098
uh we are installing and maintaining

86
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,980
grip navigation systems spring builders

87
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,238
in greenhouses and open field for the

88
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,579
hours

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,280
and I was also involved in the

90
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,080
establishment of modern farms and water

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,419
management for pressure rest irrigation

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,978
systems in the sultanate of Oman where

93
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:20,579
the sultan had given lands to the omanis

94
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,319
so we our company participated a lot in

95
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,139
those programs

96
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,339
when I uh settled for in the Philippines

97
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,319
for good I started us

98
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:33,839
a substitute teacher High School teacher

99
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,939
at centralism State University

100
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,579
and

101
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,100
I participate until I become

102
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,959
a professor at the department of

103
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,879
agricultural devices service engineering

104
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,839
technology engineering in that

105
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,079
University

106
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,198
I did uh Agricultural and biosystems

107
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,300
Engineering subjects and one of the

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,180
subjects that I love is all about

109
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,639
Advanced Techniques to from culture

110
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,459
which focuses on the things that I love

111
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,240
to do all about Hydroponics aquaponics

112
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,019
and

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,800
uh control agriculture environment

114
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,240
so later that uh when we called it hit

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,900
the Philippines

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,340
the secretary of agriculture called some

117
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:24,060
of the uh uh researchers in Philippine

118
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:27,599
universities and I was one of those and

119
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,699
I was uh instructed to lead the urban

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
farming Innovation Center

121
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,620
we're in we are promoting Urban

122
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,139
agriculture with innovate the Innovative

123
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,418
Technologies and we established

124
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,100
demonstration Farms especially in Metro

125
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:44,159
Manila and other big cities in the

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,280
Philippines we also assist and provide

127
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,680
suggestions in the policy making and

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,239
implementation of urban agriculture in

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,340
the country

130
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,720
so central Arizona State University is

131
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,079
located there

132
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,620
in the central part of Luzon

133
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,599
so it is about

134
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,699
150 about uh four hours drive from Metro

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,699
Manila the capital city

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,160
so the early developments in clsu is

137
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,379
when I have this design of automatic

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,960
communication controllers for Dockers

139
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,180
using local soil moisture activated

140
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,000
controller

141
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:27,780
and uh I believe that

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,519
a great idea as it started from crew

143
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,638
uh idea

144
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,459
and we started from this so we employ

145
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,680
this in our studies and research in uh

146
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,918
the board chart of the universe

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,220
later I was called by our

148
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,918
our University to lead the establishment

149
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,340
of a demonstration Farm using the

150
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,339
Israeli greenhouses and Technologies uh

151
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:55,799
for the production of honeydew melon and

152
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:59,399
we do that in the soil we are not we are

153
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,780
doing that in soil in soilist culture

154
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:06,538
but we were able to produce uh

155
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,339
uh superior quality of honey

156
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:13,079
and they love it

157
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:16,019
later I pursued my PhD and I focused on

158
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,918
the hydroponic honey to melon on Water

159
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:23,098
Management of uh hydropology melon and

160
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,258
this is my study as you can see in the

161
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:28,259
pictures

162
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:31,860
we do not have such uh systems that you

163
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,139
have here so we have to invent

164
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,699
of our own system using the locally

165
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,699
available materials like that

166
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:46,259
and later I was sent by Fulbright to

167
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,960
University of Arizona wherein I have

168
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,060
this integration abroad with tilapia and

169
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,758
vegetablesystems

170
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,538
and uh it is actually the result of this

171
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,900
is available online published under the

172
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,860
uh scholarship uh Publishing House in

173
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,399
German

174
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,479
and here you can see my faculty

175
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,179
professor

176
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,899
Dr Kevin Fitzsimmons

177
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,360
and and

178
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:19,620
uh all those prawns that we have grown

179
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,340
in this system the problem is uh located

180
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,500
situated under the the uh rough system

181
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,500
not with the tilapia

182
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,759
so in one of the University of Arizona I

183
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,458
uh also involved myself in the

184
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,620
production of tomatoes mushrooms and

185
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,679
controlled environment and the culture

186
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,019
and I got a lot of knowledge about what

187
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,399
they are doing there in Biosphere 2 and

188
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:50,519
in the lunar Greenhouse so uh I attended

189
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,879
lectures on how they do this which

190
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,000
probably I can use in when I go back to

191
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,539
the Philippines now this is my report

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,059
this is what I'm going to share

193
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:05,639
so

194
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:08,458
there are many Publications that tells

195
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,500
that scientists all over the world agree

196
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,379
that today's agricultural production

197
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,080
systems are not any more suitable for

198
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,458
the Newport security challenges of our

199
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,620
century

200
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,018
that is prevailing farming systems

201
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,700
cannot meet the food requirements of a

202
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:28,440
growing population

203
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:31,560
in the first uh tier in this diagram you

204
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,680
can see an area in Orange

205
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:38,278
uh bounded by the red and green

206
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:41,278
and since 2010 to 2050

207
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:44,039
that area is increasing that means that

208
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,639
the food requirement of the population

209
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,519
is increasing and probably according to

210
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,620
scientists by 2030 which is seven years

211
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,539
from now in many parts of the world

212
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,240
there will be severe hunger

213
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:00,620
which would result to chaos

214
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,139
and that would threaten the peace on our

215
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,259
uh in the globe in the Philippines

216
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,480
despite the advances that we have in

217
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,159
modern agriculture that is from Farm

218
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,700
mechanization that the government is

219
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:16,980
pursuing to protected cultivation onto

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,100
plant genetics food production

221
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,159
especially in our country remains at the

222
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,860
mercy of the changing climate subject to

223
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,259
various destructive elements of natural

224
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,778
and man-made disasters

225
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,958
and there are other serious interrelated

226
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:38,278
problems like overpopulation Urban

227
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,838
migration and the Aging farmers

228
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,659
and of course

229
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,200
corruption because we are popular with

230
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:45,199
corruption

231
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:51,120
So based on the United Nations product

232
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:54,179
projection as of today we will have a

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,799
population of 117 million

234
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,859
more than that

235
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:01,740
and it is scattered in only three

236
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,079
hundred thousand square kilometers

237
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,060
if you are going to study that that is

238
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,139
six times greater than the population of

239
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,639
New York

240
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:15,120
actually we are ranking about 1.4 we

241
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,799
have we have one we are one point four

242
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,500
to six percent of the total world

243
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,458
population ranking number 13 in the

244
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,578
world

245
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:27,299
not a small touch

246
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:29,759
and the population density is about 384

247
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,879
people per square kilometers in Metro

248
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,939
Manila alone those that that colored

249
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,500
area there propose of several small

250
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,920
cities

251
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,039
but we have we are the most the fourth

252
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:47,159
world's most crowded City

253
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,799
and talking of this of Manila

254
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,519
this one

255
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,759
it is

256
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,620
the most densely populated city in the

257
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,958
world

258
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,659
well this is one of the big problems

259
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:04,679
that we have in students

260
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:08,659
and also because of this people want to

261
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,659
to go to the cities

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,659
the countryside they do not want to be

263
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,639
farmers

264
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:23,000
in 2015 it is about 51.2 percent

265
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,259
the rural population is about

266
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,778
48.8 percent

267
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:33,899
by 2020 it had increased to 54 percent

268
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:36,120
so living the old farmers in the local

269
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,220
communities

270
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,620
to work on the parks

271
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,440
and the average age of Filipino Farmers

272
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,419
now is between 57 to

273
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
60 just imagine

274
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,679
that age you'll be working in the

275
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,778
department

276
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,399
so there will be a critical shortage of

277
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,799
Farm Workers within 15 years and

278
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,360
actually it's happening now

279
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,139
and

280
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,459
our youth love to stay in

281
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,039
the city

282
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:08,000
Dominique computers they love they don't

283
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,000
want to kill the soil

284
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,740
and also the impact of climate change in

285
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,560
our country

286
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,680
the Philippine agriculture is sick we

287
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,379
have accepted that and dying

288
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,539
its contribution to the country's GDP

289
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,100
has dropped and continues to decline

290
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,799
over the years

291
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,278
vegetable industry alone is almost in

292
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,500
comatose condition because every year we

293
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,799
are devastated by so many natural

294
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,000
disasters especially typhoons

295
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,919
and Farmers Financial condition

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,360
continues to worsen their dignity

297
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,458
crossed and devastated that is why

298
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,720
farmers found farming not profitable

299
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,778
anymore

300
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,300
and as an attractive business so they

301
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,879
were forced to sell their lands to

302
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:02,699
business

303
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,039
just lately we I a big thankful

304
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,100
destructive typo there's a bus to the

305
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,838
Philippines and

306
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,240
the regions in the northern part of the

307
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,260
Philippines were Dynasty rice for

308
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
example

309
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,000
that's why we are I'm not going to call

310
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,399
Toronto agricultural country but we are

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,159
one of the

312
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:28,399
uh highest ranking importer of Rights

313
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,399
because we are rice eating country

314
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:36,060
so because of this when I arrived from

315
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,239
Tucson from Arizona

316
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:42,000
I thought it is much uh it is not proper

317
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,940
for me to to utilize what we have

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,139
learned so I submitted proposals to the

319
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,480
government particularly in the

320
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,198
department of Science and Technology and

321
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,759
I was awarded of six uh projects from

322
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:59,519
2012 to 2022 and we were able to develop

323
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,879
this uh demo Farm

324
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:07,560
and from this demo farm that has become

325
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:10,320
a center of of a promotion of modern

326
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,739
technology into Philippines of course

327
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,820
what we have there is not similar to

328
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,698
your high-tech gear technology but

329
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,699
this is a proof that we Filipino can do

330
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:26,639
it even in our own small way using

331
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,899
locally available materials and our

332
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,198
engineers

333
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,600
we were able to produce some

334
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,979
researches and result of this and one of

335
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,879
them is about uh Tomatoes we grow beef

336
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,459
steak and

337
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,919
uh cherry tomatoes

338
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:49,379
and the technology has been shared to

339
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:52,319
many people especially those in

340
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:56,100
commercial level

341
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,019
this uh sample this setup is scalable

342
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,778
and we can even improve this because

343
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,639
this is our prototype

344
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,799
from using our locally available

345
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,980
materials especially nutrient solution

346
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,299
which has become the biggest problem in

347
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,320
the hydroponic industry in the

348
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,578
Philippines

349
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,620
so we uh try to produce our own

350
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,439
hydroponic system we formulate our own

351
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,799
and share this to the government and

352
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,920
have it available at low price

353
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,399
so these systems that we have are

354
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:32,458
scalable from commercial to Backyard

355
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:37,500
this is our backyard systems so we can

356
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:40,439
grow here uh leafy vegetables and birds

357
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,019
and probably you will see how these

358
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,779
plants can grow in this system

359
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,299
because of the sunrise will not be

360
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,879
available to all all the levels but you

361
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,578
know we first harvest on the top

362
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,039
and every Harvest we promote everyone

363
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,379
and we start from the bottom again

364
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,980
so that's how we do that

365
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:04,380
some uh some uh it would include labors

366
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,240
but you know just to maximize the space

367
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,760
and the investment

368
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,000
and it was uh there will be a smaller

369
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,099
version of this we call household model

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,338
so it's smaller but it depends you know

371
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,139
because the capacity of our investors is

372
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:22,139
limited

373
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,540
and also we have this one square meter

374
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,500
Garden

375
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:33,740
which can be established in Condominiums

376
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,740
and small areas Even in our roof tanks

377
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:42,660
and also we use this for us a system for

378
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:47,720
aquaponics is one square meter plan

379
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,720
we also use the discarded fruit boxes

380
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,740
to contain nutrient solution and plug

381
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,000
their

382
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,120
lattices like this

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,339
and this is our system that we use for

384
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,000
tomato production

385
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:05,839
and somehow we were able to do some

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,419
research about this of course we can

387
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:12,720
improve this and this we always tell to

388
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:15,480
our Farmers to our investors that

389
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,058
there's a lot of things that needs to be

390
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,620
improved but we can start on what we

391
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:23,038
have learned

392
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:26,099
we also grew uh cucumbers

393
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,500
different types of cucumbers and we have

394
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,619
done some Harvest

395
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,660
what uh is good here is that we are not

396
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:36,000
only producing more

397
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:41,100
but we are producing safer

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,619
cleaner and fresher vegetables

399
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:46,500
so the nutrient solution that were

400
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:49,739
discarded are not prone to waste we use

401
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,419
that to fertilize our open programs like

402
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,839
dragon fruit

403
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:57,000
our dragon fruit is so sweet because we

404
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,240
you're delighted discarded fertilizer

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,900
from our Hydroponics systems

406
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,900
foreign

407
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:13,279
copies from grown in global culture

408
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,280
using aquaponics systems

409
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:20,038
and also some researchers conducted an

410
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,538
aquaponics systems for insulin plant

411
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,558
production

412
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:27,599
our University is introducing this

413
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,160
herbal medicine

414
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,099
so I

415
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,000
told them that there is a safer way to

416
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,259
do this and one of this is to do that

417
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,579
aquaponically rather than planting

418
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,579
inside

419
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:46,879
we also uh

420
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,879
Dr you know we constructed a

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,160
vertical interferment system there we

422
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:55,678
fabricated this out of our locally

423
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,080
available materials and we grow these

424
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,440
tomatoes and other leafy vegetables and

425
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,220
herbs we also try to grow uh

426
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,919
struggle

427
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,740
now when the coffee is 19 pandemic

428
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,919
happened

429
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:17,339
the agricultural agriculture agriculture

430
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,140
in the Philippines really suffered and

431
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:22,439
this pandemic have revealed the

432
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:25,280
fragility of Our Food Systems laptops

433
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:30,120
and checkpoints made food distribution

434
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:34,019
and delivery difficult to Impossible

435
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:36,178
in uh for some time maybe one month or

436
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:40,259
some weeks our country was paralyzed

437
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:43,740
because we do not know what to do

438
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:47,279
and many of our countrymen suffered

439
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,779
from hunger and poverty because no one

440
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,119
is allowed to book

441
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:54,960
our health and livelihood and of course

442
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,639
the economy was greatly devastated

443
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,900
this is what happened in the Philippines

444
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,460
before

445
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,038
we have so much production in the

446
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,840
countryside that should be brought to

447
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,819
the cities

448
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,240
but there is no government

449
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:12,720
delivery is prohibited

450
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,400
and also that's why most of the produce

451
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,860
are just from

452
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,860
sometimes spread to Lifestyle

453
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,298
so because of this the Philippine

454
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:30,058
government uh somehow give

455
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:33,859
assistance to our people

456
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:37,798
but there are also those uh agencies

457
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:41,099
private agencies and organizations who

458
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:43,079
help the communities which we call the

459
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,699
bayanihan we call this Pioneer

460
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,619
cooperation

461
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,740
it is a spirit

462
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,139
that was released during the pandemic

463
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,200
which is uh all about the community

464
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,580
community pantries and donations from

465
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,580
people

466
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,439
which somehow relieve our problems

467
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,899
during those times

468
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,779
so one of the government intervention is

469
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:11,100
to produce more vegetables produce more

470
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:14,819
food and so when the new secretary came

471
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:18,298
in the person of Dr William Darr we made

472
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:21,119
this a proposal plant plant and this is

473
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:23,220
all about Urban agriculture because the

474
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,219
urban areas was totally devastated

475
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,460
during those times and it encouraged the

476
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,220
Filipino to go back to farming

477
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,179
and to maximize the use and productivity

478
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:39,360
of every land resources and space

479
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,640
he is encouraging us to have a new

480
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,259
thinking for agriculture and that is to

481
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,259
apply modern technology

482
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,419
later a house bill was approved that

483
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,159
talks about the integrated Urban

484
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,919
agriculture Act

485
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,679
and that is all about the creation of

486
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
the urban

487
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,480
Agriculture and that leads to the

488
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,220
creation of the center which we call the

489
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,120
urban farming Innovation and learning

490
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,058
center

491
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,639
I was called to lead this program to

492
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,980
lead the center and we have done a lot

493
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,700
of campaign all over the country

494
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:21,839
and we have these uh Five Point agenda

495
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,400
just to unify and harmonize the

496
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,519
activities of the Department of

497
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,120
Agriculture and it called the people to

498
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:34,019
be involved in food production

499
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,879
and this is one of our setups that we

500
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,839
are introducing this is an aquaponics

501
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,820
system

502
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:42,058
and

503
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:44,158
we grew uh tilapia

504
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,960
this is our favorite and we grow a lot

505
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,140
of letters in disease

506
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,620
of course this is just a small uh maybe

507
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,280
this is just four by six square meters

508
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:59,879
but we we can scale this one

509
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,558
according to the uh Financial capability

510
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,820
of partner

511
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:09,779
also we try to

512
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:12,058
uh involve the uh

513
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,819
people are the urban dwellers to be

514
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:18,960
involved so all those people that are

515
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:21,599
living in urban areas we encourage them

516
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,600
to produce it and use all these spaces

517
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:28,019
even in their workspace

518
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,980
those people involved in tourism we help

519
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,440
them

520
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,839
so that all those who will uh have

521
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,820
vacation in their area will not only

522
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,538
enjoy the scenery that they have there

523
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:42,058
but we also learn how to do a school

524
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:45,599
and all those people in the in the

525
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:48,119
academic we try to introduce using their

526
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:51,298
roof deck for their universities

527
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,459
and one of them introduced this crops in

528
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:54,500
the sky or crops in the rooftop like

529
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,940
that

530
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:02,519
utilizing all the spaces in this city

531
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,519
and this one is one of our our

532
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,519
participants

533
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,419
doesn't have a space in their in their

534
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,519
area

535
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,659
so we use the Rooftop

536
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,298
and the production is really very uh

537
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:22,320
improved very much improved and they

538
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:24,298
love it and once they the neighborhood

539
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,839
learn about this one they were all

540
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:31,980
encouraged to do the same

541
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:36,058
so this is some of our uh projects

542
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:39,679
we involve we only use PBC pipes because

543
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:41,940
we do not have that rectangular one

544
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,778
at the end

545
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,940
and so somehow we we produce these

546
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,400
different types of vegetables

547
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,759
also

548
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,820
some of our clients

549
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,000
try to duplicate what we have there in

550
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:02,579
our research area and they put uh he

551
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,599
wants to try this for uh controlled

552
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:08,460
environment

553
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:10,139
using this fabricated uh chamber

554
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,179
so

555
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,179
if the Philippines actually

556
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,659
need help and that is why I told Dr

557
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,778
Manson

558
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,520
that if somehow we can have some

559
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:26,880
collaboration with our universities

560
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,700
because the Target now is the use

561
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,340
all those people in the academy must

562
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,960
call those students to learn more about

563
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,899
food production

564
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,400
and it must be included in their

565
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,460
curriculum

566
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,500
and so if we could have collaboration

567
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,079
and share

568
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,880
what you have here in Cornell

569
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:52,980
probably

570
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,220
it would be a great help to our people

571
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,860
and in conclusion Urban farming actually

572
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,839
we have found out is a valuable strategy

573
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:04,740
augmenting the code requirements in

574
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,959
urban and rural areas and utilizing

575
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,298
modern agriculture like smart and

576
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,179
presidential agriculture could enhance

577
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:15,900
food production that would utilize the

578
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,880
limited resources like water space and

579
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,600
energy

580
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,460
and policy makers should legislate laws

581
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,759
to involve the youth

582
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,538
because they will be the one who will

583
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:33,480
suffer if they will not in the religion

584
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,879
telling them that food security is not

585
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,740
only the concern of the government of

586
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,039
the the professors

587
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,058
but it is our concern all of us is

588
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,440
concerned

589
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:48,599
so we are encouraged to plant

590
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,360
plants no established

591
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,980
as a challenge our secretary is always

592
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,619
telling these ones

593
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,058
that no pandemic can vary our dreams and

594
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,239
aspirations

595
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:02,460
that no lockdowns can slow us down

596
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,500
so let us turn challenges into

597
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,259
opportunities to survive

598
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,538
and move forward towards a good secure

599
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:13,079
and resilient Philippines with

600
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:16,019
prosperous farmers and Fishers

601
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,339
and so we were all encouraged and

602
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,440
somehow

603
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:23,038
the Filipino people

604
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,380
were uh have have no new thinking for

605
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,658
agriculture because of his presence

606
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,900
before US Secretary

607
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:35,059
and from here I would like to thank you

608
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,059
very much for listening

609
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:38,778
wait sometimes

610
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,840
sometimes you know I have one questions

611
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,240
yes sir

612
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,359
um I'm gonna start I should just give

613
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,759
you one from a participation

614
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:53,099
participation perspective

615
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,640
how much participation are you seeing

616
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:59,399
recently from the through

617
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,159
uh growth in American culture the

618
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,798
participation of our group sir of the

619
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,140
general population oh okay people in the

620
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:10,319
city I mean how quickly is this growing

621
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,360
and where is it going oh before when we

622
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,480
introduced this uh Hydroponics and

623
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,178
aquaponics people are telling that this

624
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,038
is a stupid technology especially for a

625
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,380
country like the Philippines we're in we

626
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,940
are totally agricultural country

627
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,460
but later

628
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,860
you know just informing them the

629
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,380
importance of this and the relevance of

630
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:35,699
the benefits of this later after 10

631
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:39,899
years many have participated not only in

632
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,700
in the urban communities but also in uh

633
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:46,019
rural areas

634
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,538
and I would suggest from

635
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:52,079
a year one that we started this

636
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:54,200
we are probably about six from one to

637
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,359
ten we are about on level six of

638
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,360
acceptance and interest

639
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,819
and somehow

640
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,898
with the program that government I think

641
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:09,418
we have uh helped them it's not it not a

642
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,239
bunch of crazy scientists anymore so

643
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,520
they're accepting of it

644
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,700
how how is it going from there from

645
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:21,960
there uh our government is pursuing this

646
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,419
Urban Agriculture and a house bill is uh

647
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,778
approved in the lower house and it is

648
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:30,480
the the the Senate now is uh creating a

649
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:34,679
a joint a camera committee on this

650
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,399
talking on this and and uh actually the

651
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:42,059
first thing that they are doing is to

652
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,558
include this in the curriculum

653
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:46,918
because

654
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,200
it is the youth that needs this to to be

655
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,820
to learn these things so this is going

656
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,819
to be reaching down into like Elementary

657
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:57,359
School High School yes sir yes sir

658
00:30:53,819 --> 00:31:00,359
because from uh the elementary school

659
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,658
the lab of filling the soil or growing

660
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:06,439
food like this must be thought

661
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,440
yes ma'am

662
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,819
your lives

663
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:52,679
oh we have in the Philippines the

664
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:56,038
international rights Research Institute

665
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,019
and we also have a Philippine version of

666
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:01,079
that which we call the Philippine rice

667
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:04,859
Institute of the field rats which try to

668
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:08,579
improve our our varieties

669
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,678
and before let's say 20 years ago our

670
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:14,220
the average uh

671
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,640
uh Harvest of rice per hectare is only

672
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,640
about 75 kavans this is about 50

673
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,419
kilograms in one you know sack like that

674
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,399
but today our Farmers know because of

675
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,559
the influence of these two institutes

676
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:33,959
they and the the Improvement of the uh

677
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:36,359
varieties we are now growing about 200

678
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,919
kabans per hectare

679
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,558
of course

680
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,899
the land area is reduced

681
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,200
because of you know as we grow the

682
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:48,658
population and also the the urban

683
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,759
uh because of the industries they are

684
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,960
you uh we are losing several hectares of

685
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,058
land every year

686
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,259
but with that uh increase in Harvest

687
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,519
because of the Improvement of rice

688
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,278
varieties

689
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,980
we have

690
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:08,000
and also the only problem that we have

691
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,000
there is the climate

692
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,058
no matter how how uh good our productive

693
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,919
systems here we do not have full control

694
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,099
of the

695
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,460
somehow they are trying to to improve

696
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:26,839
the varieties having this uh resistance

697
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:33,079
to weed resistance to to

698
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:33,079
uh drought and submergence to water

699
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,140
chat uh let's take this one first time

700
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,700
part like

701
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:53,220
types stuff like that

702
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,558
um so have there been any challenges

703
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,220
on certain structure or post a bunch of

704
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:03,058
the same Enterprise oh

705
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,640
uh using this uh low-tech technology we

706
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:09,119
have somehow improved the production

707
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,179
and there are several studies on

708
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,300
uh comparing this in the the traditional

709
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,300
system

710
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:22,220
we have improved the production

711
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,220
because you can do this everywhere

712
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,899
even in the uh cities I just don't know

713
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,300
whether I answered your program

714
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,819
and um

715
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,519
the intervention of the city government

716
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,519
is really very great

717
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,918
because there in the city especially in

718
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:45,119
Metro Manila they are employing this

719
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:47,039
this uh uh incentive that if you in

720
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,320
terms of vacant lot in an area or let's

721
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,779
say in a subdivision you can utilize

722
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,980
them and the owner of that lab

723
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:59,780
will be Exempted to to taxes

724
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:04,679
and so a lot of people in the community

725
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:07,740
utilize those uh technique and the owner

726
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,539
of those uh lands actually or those Lads

727
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:13,379
are actually

728
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:16,259
uh like the the idea rather than keeping

729
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,599
it very dirty and uh you know weeds will

730
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,200
grow there and it's very

731
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,599
um

732
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,598
not nice to look at especially the city

733
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,660
there's a question that came in on the

734
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,660
zoo oh

735
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,159
uh Paul writes hello thank you for

736
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,220
sharing your experience could you please

737
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,980
let me know how to how to split the cost

738
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:43,019
of hydroponic equipment the participant

739
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,639
pay for the equipment who manages the

740
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,858
technical stuff such as the nutrient

741
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,500
solution and then do you teach them how

742
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:51,239
to manage the crops okay right so

743
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,480
there's there's the expenses involved

744
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,819
yes uh in the Philippines you know the

745
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,760
the investors are really afraid to

746
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,640
invest because you know

747
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,160
so we have to cut the cost to cut the

748
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,159
cost of our establishment that's why we

749
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:12,539
utilize everything what is there in the

750
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:17,039
locality especially the uh substrate

751
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:20,480
here you use uh different types

752
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,858
Brown pool the

753
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,480
expanded claim

754
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,799
and we are going to import that in the

755
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
Philippines

756
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,760
so we use what is locally available like

757
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,680
gravel like uh volcanic Cinder like

758
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,079
lahar

759
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,519
we have a lot of Lahar in the

760
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,519
Philippines because of the Pinatubo

761
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,280
eruption you remember that one and

762
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,219
because we are rice producing country we

763
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:52,740
utilize rice hub

764
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:57,179
and carbonized rice hot and we are also

765
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:59,699
having this uh waste of coconut uh you

766
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,219
know from the coconut

767
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:05,460
so we have a lot of cocoa choir and

768
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:07,858
cocoa uh beet to use rather than

769
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,440
importing them now for the cost of

770
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,239
establishment of greenhouse we try to

771
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,659
simplify the greenhouse

772
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:18,479
but thinking into consideration the

773
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:19,980
impact of Thai foods that we have

774
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,980
so far

775
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,719
our design is good enough to withstand

776
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,400
the signal number three that you have

777
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,578
about

778
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,820
less than 200 kilometers per hour wind

779
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:34,140
so we can still manage to get that one

780
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,838
so

781
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:39,239
what we have there is we usually share

782
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,219
what we know

783
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,779
everything

784
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:46,078
just to help

785
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,960
our farmers and from the establishment

786
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,099
of the greenhouse on how to prepare the

787
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,858
seeds

788
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:57,180
even to Growing the maintenance of the

789
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:58,440
nutrient solution uh we do that in

790
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,719
seminars

791
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,619
now uh in fact there are so many

792
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,139
available materials that was recorded

793
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,460
by our the Department of Agriculture and

794
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:11,039
the department of Science and Technology

795
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,338
available online for them

796
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,440
you just click uh see LSU

797
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:17,119
Chito

798
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,700
Google

799
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,338
is there and it is available

800
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:26,699
I also have some Publications

801
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:28,799
for some of these Technologies which are

802
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:32,219
available free online

803
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,660
so that is how we could help and we have

804
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,118
our team in central Arizona State

805
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,819
University that when you request

806
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:43,200
from our University president

807
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,539
we can send even in the farthest place

808
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,019
in the Philippines just to help

809
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:52,559
extend what we have known and shared to

810
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:56,358
them whatever they need

811
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,358
all right beginning of your presentation

812
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,500
uh has that affected your efforts at all

813
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,500
yes of course

814
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:11,279
you know you know this sounds funny but

815
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,838
you know I just uh years ago we are

816
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,359
about number three in Asia about

817
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,460
corruption

818
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,098
two or three years later we are number

819
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,519
one and it is this is what is happening

820
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:25,140
one of these people in in uh that those

821
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,019
countries tell that

822
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:31,098
corruption in their country is always

823
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,099
done under the table

824
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,680
and

825
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,140
another country oh

826
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:42,059
that's nothing corruption in our country

827
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:45,000
happens oh on top of the table

828
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:48,239
but in the Philippines it's different

829
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,199
we include the table in the Philippines

830
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:55,739
that is how bad I hope it would be

831
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:59,098
corrected actually we are

832
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,559
just laughing at this but you know

833
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:04,619
production is everywhere

834
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:07,500
but probably worse in our country

835
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:10,200
yes sir I'm curious if there's uh

836
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,539
vegetables like uh native to the

837
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,879
Philippines or the population uses that

838
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:16,858
we're not maybe aware of in the U.S but

839
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,119
you're finding like success growing them

840
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:23,460
in the Philippines yes sir we can do uh

841
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,039
some research about that but

842
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,679
introducing some of ours that is how

843
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,719
that is why some of our University my

844
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,618
friends there wanted to make

845
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,618
collaboration with

846
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:38,699
Cornell

847
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,619
we really love to learn from you

848
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,019
we really need

849
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,559
more knowledge how to improve our

850
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,559
systems

851
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,119
yes sir how much

852
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,119
um

853
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,740
or we usually uh do what we call

854
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:02,159
Tropical Greenhouse

855
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:05,879
tropical means whatever the surroundings

856
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:09,118
you will utilize that yes

857
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,480
so we I usually discourage them to

858
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,320
introduce funds they call them

859
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,699
and what we have is only a motor

860
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,480
and

861
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:23,879
a system we call passive system just to

862
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,980
pull the nutrient solution

863
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:32,400
we do not use any cooling systems

864
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,000
and just to limit the cost of energy and

865
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,000
the investment uh

866
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:42,779
so we call it we tropicalize the system

867
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,899
of course it is the growth is affected

868
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:49,019
but somehow we can grow

869
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,180
number one there is the presence the

870
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:53,159
devastation of insects

871
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,118
so inside the greenhouse of course we

872
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,118
will not spray

873
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:02,000
especially for short duration crops like

874
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,000
living vegetables

875
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,039
we try to limit the interest

876
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:18,858
oh yeah uh so far our structure uh it is

877
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,180
just made of uh

878
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:23,819
iron pipes

879
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:25,199
and it is fully welded

880
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,880
and

881
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,639
uh

882
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,740
strongly connected to the ground

883
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:38,519
so and we do some bracing

884
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:42,539
just not to allow water during typhoons

885
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:44,759
heavy downfall to to go inside and

886
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,139
affect our crops and of course the

887
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,260
strong wind

888
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:53,960
somehow we were we were successful in

889
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,960
doing those uh structures

890
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:03,420
so they were good through category three

891
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:07,139
yes it is about not it is about uh 200

892
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:10,260
kilometers per hour something like that

893
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:12,000
very strong if you have if you uh know a

894
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,060
coconut tree

895
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,219
it would bend to about

896
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:19,400
50 to 45 degrees like that in Signal

897
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,399
number

898
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:27,980
you can see a bamboo then put

899
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,980
Bend like that signal

900
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:36,480
and we somehow uh managed to

901
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:39,779
have those structures

902
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,579
all right uh let's hold the stop

903
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,579
questions there and thank uh

904
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,259
thank you very much

905
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,539
and of course to my host professor

906
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,200
and also to Cornell and to all of you

907
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:54,199
thank you

908
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:03,539
this has been a production of Cornell

909
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,539
