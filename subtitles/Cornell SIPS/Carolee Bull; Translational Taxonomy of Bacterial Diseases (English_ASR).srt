1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,839
University

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,429
okay I want to thank Penelope and the

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:17,149
students from the boys Thompson for

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,379
inviting me in and this is the first

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,629
time I've ever been called a

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,879
translational tax anima stand in fact

8
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,488
this is a term translational taxonomy is

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,579
a term I coined and so having that term

10
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:30,649
being actually applied to me is kind of

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,480
interesting because no nobody knows what

12
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:34,219
I'm talking about until I give you no

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,069
talk about it and then they're like oh

14
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,259
that's what it is I tend to refer to

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,140
myself as a phyto bacteriologist or

16
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:44,780
sometimes a bacterial taxonomy but a

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,200
reluctant one at that but it it is a lot

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,630
of what I do in fact or how I approach

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,420
research really want to thank thank you

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,070
and your cohort for bringing me up here

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,640
and I learned a great deal from you all

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:01,070
and I appreciate that just an aside for

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,170
mentoring I believe that you know

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,329
mentorship goes both ways it really is a

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,210
relationship and that mentors often

26
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,339
learn as much from their mentees as the

27
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,408
mentees learn from their mentors and so

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,539
that's the approach that I've taken so

29
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:22,999
I've learned a great deal again here in

30
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:25,490
fact I learned about app ters app tumors

31
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:27,259
after Moe's yesterday and so if you

32
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:29,959
don't know what app to murrs are there

33
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,280
people here that do and I'm going home

34
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,769
to research them because I think they

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,989
could be really really powerful okay so

36
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:38,328
we're going to talk about translational

37
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:46,938
taxonomy for bacterial pathogens just

38
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:48,108
two groups of course just to give you an

39
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:50,328
outline of what we're going to talk

40
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,489
about today really want to talk about

41
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:54,228
the complicated state of bacterial

42
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:56,449
taxonomy many people think it's

43
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:59,090
complicated I don't I can keep lots of

44
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,859
information in different systems in my

45
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,319
head at one time and I like to think

46
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,879
about it so it's not complicated to me

47
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,629
so when people say it's complicated I

48
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,459
think not really however I understand

49
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,709
why people think it's complicated so I

50
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,300
want to explain that I want to give you

51
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,509
some examples of what I mean by

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,090
translational taxonomy and I want to

53
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:21,379
give you a little bit of where I've come

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,060
from and where I'm

55
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,219
going in the lab what we're doing right

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,289
now so you have a feeling for how you

57
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,050
might be able to collaborate with us for

58
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,629
example and then briefly I just want to

59
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,910
say a few things that we're doing at PSU

60
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,769
in general and I want to do that because

61
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:38,719
that's where I spend a lot of my time

62
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,909
these days is as a department head and

63
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,530
head of a research center I spend a lot

64
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,060
of time doing other things than the

65
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,830
research so the people who do the

66
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:52,729
research these are some of the pictures

67
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:54,410
and you'll see okay so as Penelope said

68
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,469
I spent 20 years in the Salinas Valley

69
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,549
of California working for the USDA some

70
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,400
of the research I'm going to talk about

71
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:04,730
was done related to the Salinas Valley

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,569
and so but much of it is translatable to

73
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,189
Pennsylvania because almost everything

74
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,289
citrus that was grown in the Salinas

75
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,699
Valley and that's other cutters in

76
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:16,819
citrus are from there but they're grown

77
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,829
in California is also grown in

78
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:21,049
Pennsylvania so a lot of the same kinds

79
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,360
of questions can be asked in a different

80
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,430
context and in fact I'm still

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
collaborating across the board on some

82
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,120
of these crops these are the crops that

83
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,460
I worked on when I was working in

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,270
Salinas and some of the crop values at

85
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:38,030
least of 2000 at 2012 the values of

86
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,580
these crops I just note that for example

87
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,890
if we look at cabbage I'll just take an

88
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,600
example the cabbage production in

89
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,669
Pennsylvania is worth three million

90
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,469
dollars instead of thirty five million

91
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,419
and that's that kind of gives you the

92
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:53,539
the flavor for the whole relationship

93
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,519
between maybe the Salinas Valley in the

94
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,030
salad bowl of the u.s. is what it's

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,890
called

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,319
versus what we're doing in Pennsylvania

97
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,299
but to the growers that are producing

98
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,969
these crops they're extremely valuable

99
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,160
and so thinking about disease systems

100
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,209
and how to help those growers with their

101
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,329
diseases is important in both places so

102
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:16,759
what is translational taxonomy so I

103
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,609
think of it just like we think of

104
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,769
translational medicine which is research

105
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,459
basic research that is brought into a

106
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,310
clinic

107
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,799
I think of translational taxonomy in the

108
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,519
same way so it's looking at the three

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,400
pillars or the legs of the stool of

110
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,419
taxonomy in order to develop strategies

111
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,810
for disease

112
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,710
which is the seat on which we sit I'm

113
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,139
interested in all three pillars of

114
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:47,759
taxonomy and relation in relationship to

115
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,560
plant path that bacterial plant

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,569
pathogens and I'll just give you a

117
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,160
little bit of what that is like and I'm

118
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,439
gonna give a little bit about bacterial

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,300
taxonomy my goal is that you're all

120
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,459
awake at the end of the bacterial

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,009
taxonomy part so that we can get into

122
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,949
the disease management part okay so that

123
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,569
is my goal we'll see if it works see if

124
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,209
people are nodding off or not because

125
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:13,409
often bacterial taxonomy in general

126
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:15,029
people start to glaze over and yeah it's

127
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,750
something that I do when I need to fall

128
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:21,629
asleep at night okay so these are some

129
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,310
of my key interests and basic taxonomy

130
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,980
and I just want to put them out there so

131
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,670
that you you know that I am a little bit

132
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,100
nerdy in that I really do find pleasure

133
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,020
in reading about species concepts and

134
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,780
thinking about species concepts for

135
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,159
bacteria in particular in plant

136
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,379
pathogens I'm going to explain a little

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,660
bit about the path of our concept and

138
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,639
how we use the path of our concept and

139
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,800
whether or not it fits in some systems

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,860
and I'm really interested in where it's

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,590
breaking down and why it's breaking down

142
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,259
and I'm also interested in this question

143
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:57,989
of natural host range versus

144
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,569
experimental host ranges and what that

145
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,550
means for our classification systems and

146
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,620
so I'll just put that out there I

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,050
personally want to get rid of the

148
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,209
binomial system of nomenclature and I'll

149
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,430
just say that if you want to talk about

150
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:14,699
that later it's a it's another hour

151
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,470
seminar but I would like to junk

152
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,019
Linnaeus I think he did a great job of

153
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,960
taking the paragraph that was the name

154
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,789
of of organisms down to two words that

155
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,289
was really helpful but I think now we

156
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:32,220
need to take it to one and then I I

157
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,129
often talk about identification in with

158
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,050
regard to the appropriate level of

159
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:40,379
taxonomy where what is your target and

160
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,079
what do you need to at what level do you

161
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,350
need to identify something to actually

162
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,719
control the pathogen and often

163
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,169
researchers we want to get to a more

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,219
refined

165
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:55,079
level then a grower might need or the

166
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:57,240
grower doesn't know that they need to be

167
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,089
at a more refined level than they are so

168
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,728
so having the appropriate taxonomic

169
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,888
level understood for the management

170
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:06,628
practices is one of the places where I

171
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,650
go to when I'm talking about

172
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:13,860
translational taxonomy ok so just a

173
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:15,888
background about taxonomy in general if

174
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,330
you think about bacterial taxonomy

175
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:23,550
originally the taxonomy was based on a

176
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,889
very few principles are very few

177
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,499
characteristics and it was really based

178
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,150
on those characteristics that we needed

179
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,219
to distinguish those things that would

180
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,769
kill us from those things that won't

181
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:37,228
okay or those things that would kill our

182
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:40,139
plants versus those things that walk so

183
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:43,709
initially the basis of all taxonomy for

184
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,960
bacteria was really based on a few

185
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:52,098
principles and they were specific and

186
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:55,138
you'd see here listed a few of them and

187
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:56,490
what the result of that was is that the

188
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,379
character the groups that were

189
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,538
classified were not really groups that

190
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,250
potentially were evolutionarily coherent

191
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:08,188
but they were groups that looked alike

192
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,500
and smelled alike let's say and what

193
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,659
that resulted in were species that were

194
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,918
mono thick that means they had similar

195
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:19,199
characters and were poly polyphyletic

196
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,978
which means they had different different

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,999
evolutionary backgrounds this to us now

198
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:30,658
seems very unusual because we're used to

199
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:32,940
trying to put groups into monophyletic

200
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:35,129
groups and look at their evolutionary

201
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,469
history but if you think about it from a

202
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:40,110
historical standpoint that's not where

203
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,079
we started and this is really the basis

204
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,120
of where a lot of our our confusion

205
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:47,250
comes from and I'll just we're going to

206
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
talk about Pseudomonas a lot and the

207
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,269
folks who took the workshop heard my

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,269
spiel about Pseudomonas yesterday but

209
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:57,629
pseudo fake monas it's the Greek word

210
00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:00,028
for unit if the word money comes from

211
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,259
the same word okay so it's a fake unit

212
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,700
they put a lot of things in there that

213
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,338
looked alight but they knew

214
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,810
it wasn't really a coherent group and

215
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:14,040
we've been paying for that ever since

216
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:16,768
okay okay on top of this subjective era

217
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,289
of classification where we needed it for

218
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:23,549
health and well-being but on top of that

219
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:27,509
this idea of the new host new species

220
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:30,149
cliche that has been written about again

221
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,429
few comparative tests when I isolated

222
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,889
something from broccoli for example I

223
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:37,649
might not have had at the time the

224
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,809
ability to compare that pathogen to

225
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,419
pathogens from all over the world or

226
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:45,239
from other hosts in fact and so there

227
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:49,199
were a few tests that were done

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,419
comparatively and there were lots of

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,550
different organisms that were isolated

230
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,849
there were actually synonyms for the

231
00:09:53,549 --> 00:10:00,078
same species but which with each new

232
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,970
host people were giving them names and

233
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,919
designating them as species as if there

234
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,160
was a direct relationship between the

235
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,860
host and the specificity of that species

236
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,169
and that isn't necessarily the case or

237
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,690
wasn't necessarily the case but there

238
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:18,419
was really no way to compare broadly

239
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,000
these organisms this is a second factor

240
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:24,899
that has really added to the confusion

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,419
in Pseudomonas taxonomy okay so this

242
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,370
this led to a number of misconceptions

243
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,948
and a lot of synonyms within the

244
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,089
literature everybody with me so far

245
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:38,519
okay nobody's sleeping yet I like that

246
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,860
okay so layer on top of that the advance

247
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,929
of our technologies right so we went

248
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:49,110
from phenotypic testing and maybe host

249
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:51,509
host range testing into looking at

250
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,419
characteristics that are actually more

251
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:56,879
amenable to hypothesis testing so if we

252
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,979
talk about nucleic acid based techniques

253
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,559
for classification you can actually

254
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,019
start to do statistics you can do that

255
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,448
even with phenotypic testing but we

256
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,639
begin to think about using numerical

257
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:11,519
taxonomy or statistical methods for

258
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,049
analyzing these data and now we're at

259
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,870
the point where we can actually look at

260
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,500
whole genomes as well to see whether

261
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,720
these organ

262
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,330
or clonal are they the same are they

263
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
different and then how different is of

264
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,480
course the million-dollar question but

265
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,360
as we layer these pieces on top of that

266
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,500
background of confusion if you will or

267
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,960
of subjectiveness it becomes difficult

268
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,330
and it begins becomes difficult to tease

269
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,370
apart what is this the subjective

270
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,170
background and what is the objective

271
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,080
data and I'm going to just show you a

272
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:48,750
little bit of that as we go forward so

273
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,990
at the same time as we were moving from

274
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,490
the subjective era of classification and

275
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,710
I could spend a lot of time talking

276
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,799
about that era in particular but as we

277
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,710
were moving from that era into a more

278
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:07,469
objective era there was also going on in

279
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:09,540
the bacterial community a reorganization

280
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,970
of the code of nomenclature

281
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,980
so remember classification is one part

282
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,440
of the stool but once you've got the

283
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,810
groups classified then you have to name

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,340
them and naming is actually done by a

285
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:25,019
set of rules classification is done

286
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,600
using the scientific method so there's

287
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,240
question inquiry there's data that

288
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,670
support hypothesis but actually naming

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,279
the organism has a set of rules there

290
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,079
are no rules for classification per se

291
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,089
or there shouldn't be but for

292
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,520
nomenclature there are and that the

293
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,070
nomenclatural codes are where the rules

294
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,199
are people often confuse that they think

295
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,940
that the classification has some kind of

296
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,750
rules and that there's an appropriate

297
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,430
classification there are best practices

298
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,940
according to the scientific method and

299
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:58,949
the the thoughts and opinions of the

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,170
scientific community but they're not

301
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,610
rules the rules are here in the

302
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:06,019
nomenclature

303
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,220
okay so the bacteriologists were

304
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,659
reorganizing the nomenclature in fact

305
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,879
they knew that there were synonyms

306
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,980
throughout the bacterial nomenclature

307
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,439
and throughout the species that were

308
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,060
described and this is not just for plant

309
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,310
pathogens it was also for human

310
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,259
pathogens as well so they got together

311
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,529
and developed a new code of nomenclature

312
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:28,019
and part of the new code of nomenclature

313
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,799
required that there be a catalog of

314
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:34,689
means for

315
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:38,500
names of bacteria and that getting into

316
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:41,140
that catalog required that a name had a

317
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,730
validly published at the epithet and

318
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,429
that means it was published so we could

319
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,740
all read it it had a modern description

320
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,929
so something that we would all be able

321
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,028
to test and distinguish one organism

322
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,979
from another and then there had to be a

323
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:56,019
nomenclatural type strain that was

324
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,149
deposited somewhere that we could all

325
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,639
get ahold of it and compare our strains

326
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,409
to the problem with this is that it

327
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,169
didn't for plant pathologists the

328
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:07,958
problem is it didn't include host range

329
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:10,659
as part of that modern description so

330
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:14,759
most of our species in fact were based

331
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:18,219
on this new host new species cliche and

332
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,100
all of a sudden most of our species were

333
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,470
going to go away and disappear in fact

334
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,889
be consolidated and this is the result

335
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,750
of that approved list in 1980 so for

336
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,629
example the Pseudomonas syringes there

337
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,828
were 41 nomen species and most of those

338
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:39,820
were consolidated into Pseudomonas

339
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:43,269
syringae okay and the problem with that

340
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,790
is that we still needed to be disabled

341
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:48,458
to distinguish the pathogen from celery

342
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:50,439
from the pathogen from tomato and we

343
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:53,500
could distinguish them based on host

344
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,480
range but not at the level of the

345
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,578
species and that modern description

346
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,649
caused a lot of confusion so what plant

347
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:02,469
pathologists did and I know some of you

348
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,600
all know this it is that we took the

349
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,370
gnomon species names and these are the

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,190
specific epithets for all of these

351
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,278
species and except for those that are in

352
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,980
bold they were all put into Pseudomonas

353
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,100
syringae as path of ours of Pseudomonas

354
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,259
ringing okay those in bold we're all

355
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,629
left as species because they could be

356
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:27,458
distinguished by modern methods okay so

357
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:29,828
the path of our concept was put together

358
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:32,469
as part of the International Science

359
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:34,778
Society of plant pathologies Committee

360
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,920
on the taxonomy of plant pathogenic

361
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:41,289
bacteria say that ten times fast and

362
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,969
they developed this idea of a path of

363
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,569
our which is was supposed to be

364
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,370
temporary

365
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,579
so the idea is okay we'll put them all

366
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,919
in Pseudomonas syringae for example and

367
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:52,838
as we have all of this money for

368
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,639
bacterial taxonomy coming through our

369
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,970
governments we'll be able to tease them

370
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,889
apart into real species again okay you

371
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,399
know there's no money for a taxonomy and

372
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:06,329
so over over the 40 years that since

373
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,909
this has happened is it 40 years old 80

374
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:11,769
almost 40 years you know we've had some

375
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:14,049
progress but it's been piecemeal and

376
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,519
that is really the problem with it is

377
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,169
that we've had a piece of work done here

378
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
a piece of work done there and then

379
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:24,159
trying to understand what that whole

380
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,920
piece means is is what's difficult yeah

381
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,250
we'll go on from there okay so this

382
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,319
concept of path Abbar really a path of

383
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,570
our is designated as something that has

384
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,519
a different host range or causes a

385
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,389
different disease but is within the same

386
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:43,149
species okay now we don't know whether

387
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,528
or not we didn't at this time know

388
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,750
whether or not these things were

389
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:48,639
actually the same species or different

390
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,730
species and this has caused a lot of

391
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,100
confusion originally there were paths of

392
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,440
ours for the four species that are

393
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,019
listed here currently we have paths of

394
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,769
ours for over twenty six species just to

395
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:05,439
give you an idea okay so for plant

396
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,929
pathogenic bacteria now you don't just

397
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,870
have issues with naming bacteria that at

398
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:13,030
the species level which are coded by the

399
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:16,208
international code of nomenclature for

400
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:18,910
prokaryotes seriously if you want to

401
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,919
sleep that's the thing to read but we

402
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,259
also have a code of nomenclature for

403
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,790
naming paths of ours and you have to

404
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,588
work with both of them if you're working

405
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,928
with nomenclature of plant pathogenic

406
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,940
bacteria it's actually the kind of thing

407
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,450
I like to do so I belong on the boards

408
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,269
of both of those groups that do that and

409
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:40,390
the issue is that we've got species

410
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:43,660
subspecies paths of ours but often we're

411
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,240
really working at the level of eco types

412
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,940
or strains even when we're talking about

413
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,640
trying to control diseases there can be

414
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,490
differences between one echo type or

415
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,009
cero type or it could be any different

416
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,808
kinds of characteristic that you

417
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,660
waiting there can be differences between

418
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:03,730
strains at very fine levels and that may

419
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,798
be the level of taxonomy that we need to

420
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,140
be working at and the path of our may

421
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,779
help but it may be at this lower level

422
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,059
that you want to pay attention okay so

423
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:14,710
just a little more confusion for you so

424
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:17,200
we've got this group of organisms

425
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,990
they've been put together and now we

426
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,019
have a concept for species that was

427
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:26,230
layered on top of that so also around

428
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:30,240
the 1980s there became this idea that

429
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,240
there would be the golden rule for

430
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:36,160
bacterial species concepts if you will

431
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:38,349
and this became a species definition and

432
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,620
basically people found that if they did

433
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:43,959
DNA DNA hybridization and DNA

434
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:46,149
hybridization values were seventy

435
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,480
percent or above that that they were

436
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,190
likely the same species and just to tell

437
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,339
you what this process is because it's

438
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,630
complicated and not many people used it

439
00:18:53,339 --> 00:19:00,579
you take two different bacteria you

440
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,150
label one of the the DNA from one of the

441
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:08,109
bacteria usually with a nucleotide of

442
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,419
some sort and that is labeled and you

443
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:14,798
mix you melt them mix them together and

444
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,860
then you use you let them hybridize use

445
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,289
s1 nuclease to cut away the

446
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:22,418
single-stranded single-stranded portions

447
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,279
you're left with double-stranded DNA and

448
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:26,440
then you can measure the radioactivity

449
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,069
in your sample and compare it to a

450
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,798
sample where you've got you've put a the

451
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:35,889
same organism DNA with the same probe

452
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,490
right so you've got the organism with

453
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,350
itself

454
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,150
if the organism with something else and

455
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:42,609
the difference between those is the

456
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,590
percent hybridization so for any

457
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,509
experiment where people wanted to look

458
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,720
is this in that species or not they

459
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:50,829
would have to use all of the controls

460
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,750
necessary and do each of these

461
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:54,730
hybridizations because you couldn't

462
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,880
create a library of them and just go

463
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,650
online and look so each control had to

464
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,080
be done that means that everybody had to

465
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,090
have those type strains or path of type

466
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,689
strains and people just didn't do it in

467
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:10,919
fact it it resulted in only a few

468
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,960
laboratories being able to do taxon

469
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,269
at the level that we needed to have

470
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,930
taxonomy done so for a period of about

471
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:21,809
ten years only a few people in white

472
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,250
towers very esoteric who only wanted to

473
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:27,500
speak to themselves I'm kidding

474
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,500
don't wait this is being broadcasted

475
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:34,349
there was a there was a let's see it was

476
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:37,859
not democratized okay and so it was very

477
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:39,419
difficult to for have having normal

478
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,029
plant pathologists to be able to

479
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:46,890
determine the species of an organism

480
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:49,889
okay fast forward and one of the

481
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,560
problems with this is that if a species

482
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,020
was determine let's say in the case of

483
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,940
Pseudomonas syringae for example it was

484
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:59,099
determined that all of those paths of

485
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,019
ours actually represented nine different

486
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:06,000
species but they couldn't distinguish

487
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:09,509
those species one from another using

488
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,730
phenotypic characteristics and that's a

489
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,740
problem if I can't do the DNA DNA

490
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,259
hybridization in my lab I need those

491
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,950
phenotypic characteristics in order to

492
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,660
be able to look at whether or not

493
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:25,170
organisms that I'm isolating really are

494
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,870
one species versus another so the

495
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,000
nomenclature would would not allow us to

496
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:33,959
name species that were really these are

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,390
these are species the genomic feces is a

498
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,610
genetic species that we understand to be

499
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,350
related to one another but we weren't

500
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:41,849
allowed to name them because of the code

501
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,009
of nomenclature because there weren't

502
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:46,740
characteristics that would distinguish

503
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:48,299
them in our laboratories so now we've

504
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,490
got a system where we know that there

505
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,549
are nine species but we can't actually

506
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,220
name those species and so Pseudomonas

507
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,680
syringae still had all of these species

508
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,730
they it had nine species in it and and

509
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,220
most people had no idea which was fish

510
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,620
okay so we know that science is

511
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,539
iterative and classification is an

512
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,000
iterative process so when we start out

513
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,649
with the phenotypes and and kind of the

514
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,750
mess that we had in the beginning and

515
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,660
then we start to tease these things out

516
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,819
using the DNA DNA hybridization that

517
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,529
goes on top of that and now we've got

518
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,099
sequence data that we're trying to add

519
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,619
on top of that

520
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:29,319
we haven't really even cleaned up what

521
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:31,329
we know about the genotypes yet and so

522
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,548
there's a lot of confusion and where I

523
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:35,439
think we're going for species concepts

524
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:37,298
we're gonna get away from sequences

525
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,419
pretty quickly and it's gonna be

526
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:42,730
function as well as interactions in

527
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,400
conjunction with the sequences that are

528
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,038
going to be the basis of the forthcoming

529
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,630
species concepts okay and if anybody

530
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,329
wants to talk about that that's a whole

531
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,980
nother similar to okay so this is the

532
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,678
current status of Pseudomonas syringae

533
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,210
taxonomy and I just like to present this

534
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,240
to you because this is a clarification

535
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,798
of it okay I'm glad you think so

536
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,419
so I just want to show this to you

537
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,579
because I think I think it helps

538
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:11,710
formulate this so in gray you have

539
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:16,480
basically a genomic ease but people have

540
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,490
used sequence analysis to look at the

541
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,730
relationship between these organisms

542
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,890
right and so for example Jeannot most

543
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,500
species 3 which would be Pseudomonas

544
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,780
syringae or Pseudomonas tomatoe if it

545
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,849
was ever proposed to be that but the

546
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,220
type strain would be Pseudomonas during

547
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:35,678
a path of our tomato DC 3,000 some

548
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,409
people know that here this was

549
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,440
designated as file a group 1 by people

550
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:43,240
using sequence analysis okay and so some

551
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,580
people will refer to this group as Philo

552
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,950
group 1 some people would refer to it as

553
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:51,298
Jeannot Jeannot most species 3 Shamoon

554
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:55,240
Pseudomonas syringae syringe is

555
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:57,129
Pseudomonas syringae sensu stricto okay

556
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,929
the strictest sense of Pseudomonas ringi

557
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,090
because the type string for Pseudomonas

558
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,390
syringae is in that group and so here

559
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:06,668
are the different genomic

560
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,830
so for for example Pseudomonas can abena

561
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:12,610
it's one we're gonna talk a lot about is

562
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:15,490
a species which many people here some

563
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:19,058
people here work on organisms in this

564
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,250
group ok but was previously these were

565
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:23,319
thought to be Pseudomonas ringi but now

566
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,150
people know there are different species

567
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,899
ok everybody with me

568
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,490
anybody reacting like no they're not

569
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,790
sometimes you do the only time I've ever

570
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,769
seen people almost fight like Duke it

571
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,599
out was about this kind of stuff you

572
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,579
can't change the names of things on

573
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,259
people they get really upset okay so

574
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,899
what happens when we get a new pathogen

575
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,730
that it might be a Pseudomonas in the

576
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,980
lab right we test the phenotypic

577
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:53,630
characteristics to begin with when we've

578
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:56,660
isolated it and then we go on to do the

579
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,040
the genetic and taxonomic analysis in a

580
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,200
little more detail I'm gonna tell you a

581
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,170
couple of stories now how much time do

582
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,890
we have left

583
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,810
tell me a half an hour okay here we go

584
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,230
I'm gonna tell you a couple of stories

585
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:18,289
about how we use translational taxonomy

586
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:20,660
now so in between 2002 and 2010 there

587
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:23,329
were a number of ice outbreaks of

588
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,580
disease on parsley and these were

589
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:28,699
fluorescent pseudo monads according to

590
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:32,659
the phenotypic tests that we

591
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:35,210
traditionally do okay we knew that there

592
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,400
are two different pathogens that cause

593
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,650
disease on members of the APA see

594
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,080
so there's Pseudomonas during a path of

595
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:47,500
our coriander Cola which causes disease

596
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:49,939
on coriander or cumin and there is

597
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,279
Pseudomonas or any path of our API which

598
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,440
causes disease on celery okay and

599
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,839
they've never been reported in fact on

600
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,970
the other crop so we we thought well

601
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,339
maybe the parsley pathogen was one of

602
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,440
these two things okay so the the

603
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,240
approach that we have traditionally used

604
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,250
in my lab as a multiple sequence

605
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,620
analysis now we're moving into a whole

606
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,079
unit genome sequence analysis we can

607
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,699
talk about that later anyway I think you

608
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,710
all know what multiple locus sequence

609
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,140
analysis is you sequence a number of

610
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,360
housekeeping genes you analyze them as

611
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,970
if they were one gene and that gives you

612
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,309
a stronger phylogenetic signal and in

613
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,190
fact we were able to show that the the

614
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,799
these are an IO and you really can't see

615
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,830
this in the translation so these are

616
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,079
different to know most species of

617
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:37,759
Pseudomonas syringae so these are the

618
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,148
different species we talked about in

619
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,210
that chart

620
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:44,189
and you can you actually with multi

621
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,700
locus sequence analysis there's really a

622
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:53,009
good correlation between the mls a

623
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:56,098
information and the Janome asur the DNA

624
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:58,588
DNA hybridization values so using multi

625
00:26:56,098 --> 00:27:00,989
liquid sequence analysis you don't need

626
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:02,358
to use DNA a DNA hybridization and in

627
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:05,909
fact if you look in the literature

628
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:08,278
almost all of the plant pathology

629
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:10,409
literature now will have multi locus

630
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,108
sequence analysis instead of or in

631
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:15,359
addition to DNA DNA hybridization for

632
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:17,398
taxonomy okay and it's it's a really

633
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:20,249
good system depending upon which genes

634
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,678
you use so if we analyze this a little

635
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:26,519
more closely the the parsley strains

636
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:30,119
came from both Jeannot most pcs nine or

637
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:32,579
pseudomonas can abena or from genomic

638
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:34,588
species 3 which is the tomato group okay

639
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:37,048
so they were closely related to

640
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:40,079
Pseudomonas during a path of our api but

641
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:41,969
in fact the api if you look at the I do

642
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,908
have a pointer don't I I just like to

643
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:50,759
move okay I didn't get my workout this

644
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:52,769
morning so if you look at okay if you

645
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,200
look at the type strain for Pseudomonas

646
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,569
or any path of our API it's quite a bit

647
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,558
different than those BS strains which is

648
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:03,028
all salinas as opposed to other BS quite

649
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,308
a bit different than those other BS

650
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:08,398
strains up there and so there's there's

651
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:12,648
been a change in what we're I sell eree

652
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:15,598
and from now parsley so parsley strains

653
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:17,218
Pseudomonas syringae path of our API but

654
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:19,710
they're also Pseudomonas syringae path

655
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:21,629
of our coriander cola in the Pseudomonas

656
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,788
can of beaten group so here's a place

657
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:26,668
where we actually have two different

658
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:30,888
organisms causing the same disease on

659
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:34,619
parsley okay and I can tell you that in

660
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:36,449
you can make the Pseudomonas syringae

661
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:39,778
path of our coriander cola

662
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,239
you can make that pathogen a pathogen on

663
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,690
celery you can inoculate it you can get

664
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:47,669
some kind of plant reaction but you you

665
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,190
we've never seen it from the field on

666
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,079
celery and likewise we can get a plant

667
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,009
reaction from Pseudomonas or any path of

668
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:57,089
our API

669
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:59,099
on coriander or cilantro but in fact we

670
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:01,168
never see it from the field

671
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:03,599
okay so there's a difference between

672
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:06,179
what we're seeing in the fields and what

673
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,418
is actually causing disease and what we

674
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:12,030
isolate or what we can get to cause

675
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,130
disease or plant reactions in the

676
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:17,428
greenhouse so what does this mean to a

677
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:20,940
grower so in the Salinas Valley where

678
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,460
the the land is rented for two thousand

679
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,070
to three thousand dollars an acre per

680
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,590
year it's really expensive land that's

681
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:30,720
just the rent they turn over crops

682
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:33,629
really quickly and in fact if somebody

683
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,579
is a celery grower they might grow some

684
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,169
of these other crops but they're not

685
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:38,970
going to be growing lettuce or they may

686
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,679
not grow some other kinds of crops they

687
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,620
usually stick with in the same plant

688
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,960
family so if somebody's growing parsley

689
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:48,119
and they have the disease we really

690
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,850
recommend they rotate out of the ABAC

691
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,729
completely but if they're growing celery

692
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:56,459
and they get the disease they could go

693
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,980
and and plant cilantro so there's

694
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,160
there's a crop rotation system that they

695
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,460
can use that they won't see the pathogen

696
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,679
again that's one option okay so this is

697
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,200
the kind of strategy we use once we know

698
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,940
what the organisms are and what the host

699
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,850
ranges are and what we're seeing from

700
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,440
the field this is what I consider

701
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:19,019
translational taxonomy okay it's

702
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,509
everybody with me every some people are

703
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,418
going on oh maybe that'll work okay I

704
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:25,859
want to tell you another story this is

705
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,600
the story of peppers spot of cruciferous

706
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,979
and I want to tell that primarily

707
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,750
because I know people are working on

708
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,210
Pseudomonas touring epatha bar macula

709
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,970
Kola and organisms like that here so

710
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,308
this is the pepper spot this is some

711
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,440
symptoms of pepper spot on this I just

712
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:45,450
I'll just tell you that McCulloch was a

713
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,830
plant pathologist at the USDA at the

714
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:51,929
same time that say or when F Smith was

715
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:53,668
the leader of the program there and you

716
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:56,880
notice that that publication is

717
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,830
McCulloch 1911 at that time women were

718
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,559
allowed to publish without their

719
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:04,529
supervisors on the publication's so

720
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,690
Erwin F Smith who was considered the

721
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,509
father of phyto bacteriology

722
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,430
I had a number of women that worked for

723
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:13,200
him that published independently and did

724
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,570
independent research and I think it's an

725
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,720
interesting historical fact that that

726
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:21,869
that happened during the 1920s or early

727
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,250
early 1900s and then like 30 years later

728
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:26,189
during the 50s

729
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:29,279
I guess that's 40 years later I can't

730
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,410
count anyway you know later women were

731
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,389
not allowed to publish and in fact often

732
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,460
women did a lot of the work and were not

733
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,020
even included on the publication's and

734
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,690
so I think that's a very interesting

735
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:41,670
historical fact nonetheless she isolated

736
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,590
pseudomonas macula coli it was called

737
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,740
something else when she isolated it and

738
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:49,319
many many people work with Pseudomonas

739
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,849
syringae path of our macula Kola but in

740
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,339
fact they're working with Pseudomonas

741
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:56,189
canopy in a path about half of our Alice

742
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:58,079
lenses this is an organism that has been

743
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,210
studied for a number of years and I just

744
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,849
want to show you a little bit about how

745
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:06,029
we determined that this really was a kin

746
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:07,649
Adina but the host range for this

747
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,690
organism is different than the

748
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,330
Pseudomonas arena path of our macula

749
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,549
kolja host range in that it is a

750
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:18,389
pathogen of monocots and there are a

751
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:20,009
number of crops that will see the

752
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,020
pathogen on that we don't see

753
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:24,569
Pseudomonas syringae path of our macula

754
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:28,980
Galan when we first saw this organism

755
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:31,169
causing blight on arugula or on broccoli

756
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,700
raab we thought it was Pseudomonas

757
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,620
stirring a path of our macula Club

758
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,080
because it was coming off of a crucifer

759
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:40,349
and it was a Pseudomonas syringae okay

760
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:44,220
so one of the organisms that's worked

761
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:47,459
with you know as a model for Pseudomonas

762
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,860
syringae capibara macula Kola is es for

763
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,630
3 to 6 and I think people here work on

764
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:54,359
it right anybody ever see that number

765
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,330
before it's a great organism it causes

766
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,069
devastating disease on radish and it I

767
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:05,189
know it's a great organism it kills

768
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:07,349
things okay the thing is that there

769
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,690
there have been comparisons between this

770
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:11,689
organism - Pseudomonas or any path of

771
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,279
our tomato and there have been

772
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,230
explanations of you know molecular

773
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,799
explanations by why there are different

774
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,808
paths of ours or wide different

775
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,220
maybe different races or things like

776
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:27,480
this but there are actually different

777
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,339
species and so our thoughts about what

778
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,730
this organism is doing and what the

779
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:36,178
molecules that were analyzing are doing

780
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:38,519
have to be broadened to to realize we're

781
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,870
looking at two different species okay

782
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,470
and I know that's kind of somebody's

783
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:46,049
shocking so again this this was the

784
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,920
different genomic here's Janome especie

785
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:52,349
x' 9 so this is es 4 3 2 6 and an MLS a

786
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,300
and it is identical to the path no type

787
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,519
there's a paper where we actually look

788
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,089
at the whole genome sequences of these

789
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,490
organisms and there are some difference

790
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:05,549
when differences when we look at ret PCR

791
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:09,260
and the host range so when we isolate

792
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:14,759
from arugula and radish we only see the

793
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:17,490
es 4 3 2 6 type which is this organism

794
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,530
here now other other plants we can

795
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,418
isolate and we'll see Pseudomonas or any

796
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,710
path of our ala salensus the path of

797
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:27,299
type type so there's an interesting

798
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,309
difference there that yes you can

799
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,230
inoculate those plants and get disease

800
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:33,840
but really in the field what we're

801
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,719
seeing is only one type or the other

802
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,149
depending upon the host range okay but

803
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,839
both of these go to both crucifer and

804
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,819
monocots

805
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,919
and that is a really exciting place that

806
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,200
people are working as well I should say

807
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,019
that you can see there's path of our

808
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,648
philadelphi and then the coriander here

809
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:55,050
I have a student Beth Alger who is now

810
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:57,059
at Michigan State who were working on a

811
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,550
paper to go ahead and change the

812
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:01,409
nomenclature of all of those as well

813
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:08,789
because we know that you love when we

814
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:11,460
change the names of organisms okay um

815
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:15,570
and I'm sorry I don't know when the

816
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,820
seminar ends so what is the time 105

817
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:21,000
okay we're gonna forget the cute curb at

818
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,980
one I just got talking let me talk a

819
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,608
little bit about mushrooms so we're

820
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:29,340
using the same kind of technique to to

821
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:31,949
look at mushroom diseases and so this is

822
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,850
bacterial blotch in mushrooms there have

823
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:35,559
been attempts to control this disease

824
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:37,269
using bacteriophage and I've worked with

825
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,880
bacteriophage and a number of different

826
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:42,849
systems and what's interesting about it

827
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,039
is that in a mushroom production house

828
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,019
you really have a contained system so

829
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,360
when I think about biological control

830
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:52,119
that seems like a natural place to be

831
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,940
able to deploy biological control the

832
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,529
problem is we know from the literature

833
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,050
that there are a number of different

834
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,390
organisms that's how we do pathogenicity

835
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,670
testing on mushroom tissue there are a

836
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:07,150
number of different organisms keep going

837
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:09,820
that cause the diseases on mushrooms and

838
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,260
so blotch can be caused by Pseudomonas

839
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,180
to lass I which is what is the

840
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,460
traditionally thought of as a blotch

841
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:17,649
organism but there's also Pseudomonas

842
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,240
ginger I which is up here and then a

843
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,579
number of other organisms have been

844
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:23,489
shown to cause the disease so we wanted

845
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,440
to know what's causing disease in

846
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:29,319
mushrooms in Pennsylvania so what we did

847
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,900
was survey we've surveyed so far seven

848
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,140
different mushroom houses and this shows

849
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,599
you the sampling array from two beds of

850
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:40,449
mushrooms that we looked at in one house

851
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,210
and for each of these circles if there's

852
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:45,099
two colors that means on one cap we

853
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,800
isolated from two different spots and

854
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:50,319
got two different species from that same

855
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,500
spot each color represents a different

856
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,539
species this one had three different

857
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,969
species on that cap so there are a

858
00:36:55,539 --> 00:37:02,529
number of species we think at least

859
00:36:57,969 --> 00:37:05,919
seven species of the path of pathogens

860
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:08,350
causing blotch on mushrooms so when

861
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,289
someone came the researchers in the past

862
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:13,029
had looked at using bacteria faj to

863
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:15,219
control this disease they had a

864
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,640
bacteriophage that was effective against

865
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,500
one organism but there are more than one

866
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,519
organism there and so we're actually

867
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,809
working with a class to isolate

868
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,570
bacteriophage to all of these different

869
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:31,559
pathogens so that we can try using a

870
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,720
cocktail of them and and as we monitor

871
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:38,199
what organisms are present in houses in

872
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:42,449
different houses and I'll just move

873
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:45,969
forward we're using a similar approach

874
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:47,268
for black blackleg and soft rot of a

875
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,998
potato and I know so

876
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:53,298
you know that there's a Dickey added dam

877
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:55,998
the cola is now and has been detected in

878
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:58,849
the north northeast and of course across

879
00:37:55,998 --> 00:38:00,618
the US and so I have a new student

880
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,568
Amanda Minh yellow who is working on

881
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,619
this and she's really interested in

882
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:09,528
looking at a microbiome approach to

883
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:11,659
doing this okay I'm gonna skip through

884
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:15,588
that and just tell you that Emma

885
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:17,959
Rosenthal who was in Gregg Martin's lab

886
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:19,818
is currently working on a one of my

887
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:22,278
favorite projects which is a lettuce

888
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:24,438
disease problem this is bacterial leaf

889
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:27,858
spot on lettuce that she works on and

890
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:31,098
she we have already characterized both

891
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:33,048
the the diversity of the organisms that

892
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,239
cause the disease but we also know that

893
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:38,838
there are three races of the organisms

894
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:40,999
that cause the disease and we have

895
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,708
differential hosts for that we know that

896
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:45,978
at least for one of them there's a

897
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:47,958
single gene for resistance so Emma is

898
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:50,298
working currently we're working on

899
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,828
classifying these organisms because

900
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:53,630
they're not suits santhu Mona's

901
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,099
competitors they're really Xanthomonas

902
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,759
or tourim there's another name change

903
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:01,309
sorry and she's done she's done a great

904
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:04,358
job she's actually sequence 27 strains

905
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:07,009
and has assembled those for whole genome

906
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:09,648
analysis to to really understand what

907
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:11,478
these differences are and what what are

908
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:14,239
the factors that are related to the race

909
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:16,308
relationships she will be using forward

910
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,898
and reverse genetics to do that so that

911
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:19,699
just gives you an idea of what we're

912
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:23,538
working on now with that particular

913
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:24,949
group okay if I have a few seconds I

914
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:27,109
just want to say something about the

915
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:29,898
department this is who we are as a group

916
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:33,798
we're currently 26 faculty we run

917
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:35,659
usually around 25 to 26 graduate

918
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:38,059
students although we've been asked to

919
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:40,789
push that up to 40 by our Dean and so

920
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:42,499
that's an interesting thing everybody is

921
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:44,479
going how many graduate students do I

922
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:48,738
need to have yeah and so that's a kind

923
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:50,418
of interesting goal and we have some

924
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:53,028
strategies to get there but that's who

925
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:57,288
we are as a group we have four different

926
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:59,958
signature areas that we concentrate on

927
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:01,100
and within each signature area we

928
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:04,849
actually have Ford

929
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:07,579
different areas that that we techniques

930
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:10,039
or strategies for researching these

931
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:13,460
areas if you will so whether we're in

932
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:16,750
mushroom science and technology we use

933
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:20,659
these three different or four different

934
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,940
emphases to look at that area and so

935
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:27,109
that'll give you kind of a summary of

936
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,360
who we are research wise we have a new

937
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,820
strengths and Fido biomes we've hired

938
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,890
two people in particular but we're part

939
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:38,960
of a larger group and that's what this

940
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:40,969
is so a year ago well yeah a year ago we

941
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,240
started the microbiome Research Center

942
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:46,459
and we currently have 100 scientists who

943
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,739
are involved in this we have ten that

944
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,929
are part of a cluster higher five that

945
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:53,179
were hired in medicine five that were

946
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:55,009
hired in agriculture and there are about

947
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:57,799
five more that will be coming on board

948
00:40:55,010 --> 00:41:00,620
three and AG so the the College of Ag

949
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,560
has made a huge investment in this area

950
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:05,929
and they asked me if I would lead the

951
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:08,960
center primarily because they wanted to

952
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:11,179
have a really strong foundation for the

953
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,800
faculty that they're bringing in to be

954
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,049
able to collaborate together and they're

955
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,030
doing a great job I'd love to talk to

956
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,940
anyone about how we've organized this

957
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,910
Center but we we have a lot of

958
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,980
interaction even with the arts for

959
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:27,739
example we're having a symposium in the

960
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,320
next in November we have two different

961
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,169
sessions that we'll be having at our

962
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,150
weekly meetings that are about arts and

963
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,220
microbiomes in ways that I never like

964
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,289
it's really good I'm not controlling it

965
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:40,879
because I would have never thought to do

966
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:43,789
what they're doing so we have a

967
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,680
documentarian who is very interested in

968
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:48,139
micro biomes and what that person is

969
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,759
doing is very different than planned

970
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:52,819
pathologist would would have a

971
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,070
documentarian do quite frankly and so

972
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,840
that's kind of exciting to me but would

973
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,220
across the board there's a lot of

974
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,150
different kinds of interactions

975
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:04,339
including with our social scientists

976
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,769
I'll just say that we have a lot of

977
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,720
different and initiatives within the

978
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:11,809
department that comes with having a new

979
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,189
department head the microbiome Center is

980
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:14,869
key to our strengthening our

981
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:19,280
environmental microbiology

982
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:21,650
emphasis but we have strengths in stem

983
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,780
and stem and access to stem and

984
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,200
diversity we're building a couple of

985
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,900
bilateral programs with international

986
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,789
institutes the primary one is with the

987
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,180
university of pretoria and that's been

988
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:38,690
very successful and we have had gotten a

989
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:40,159
lot out of that we the workshop that we

990
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,679
had today is part of our comprehensive

991
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,259
professional professionalism train

992
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:47,179
training and one of the things that I've

993
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:50,050
gotten a lot of pleasure in is really

994
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:53,629
engaging with the alumni in the industry

995
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,640
so I think that's it Oh last thing is

996
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,950
just to advertise the degrees we have I

997
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,589
think two things that are unique about

998
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:02,569
our program is we have dual titles with

999
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:05,510
plant pathology so our students walk out

1000
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:09,050
the door with a PhD in plant pathology

1001
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:12,200
and maybe a PhD in biochemistry or plant

1002
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,800
pathology and international AG and

1003
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,389
development we also have an online

1004
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,370
certificate and add biosecurity and food

1005
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:21,739
defense and we have a couple of minors

1006
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:23,269
we don't have a major in plant pathology

1007
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:25,669
for the undergraduates but we have

1008
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:27,650
minors which feed our programs feed your

1009
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,190
programs in fact and feed other people's

1010
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,730
programs and so more the merrier and

1011
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,130
there we go

1012
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,139
my acknowledgments and I want to thank

1013
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,869
you all for your patience and listening

1014
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:40,809
to some of the things we do in my lab ok

1015
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:48,839
any questions

1016
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:48,840
[Applause]

1017
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:59,750
who's on zoom' who's on first I don't

1018
00:43:55,909 --> 00:44:01,699
hear anything okay and I've run right up

1019
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,829
to the limit that's what happens when so

1020
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:06,289
I have to say I planned this chalk last

1021
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,699
night I decided I decided that I wanted

1022
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:10,099
to do something different than I've done

1023
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:11,750
before and so this is my first time

1024
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:13,880
trying to talk about these things in

1025
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:18,650
this way and so I'll try it again next

1026
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,030
time maybe it'll be shorter it was

1027
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,840
curious you gave a really elegant

1028
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:28,150
example of the deciphering baton some of

1029
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:32,960
the the entities associated

1030
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:35,329
Diseases parsley but that kind of a

1031
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,740
detailed knowledge and study won't be

1032
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:42,799
often available or the Resources Board

1033
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:45,909
so presumably you have a vision of

1034
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,240
tiered management strategy where you

1035
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:53,349
lose your management recommendations

1036
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,349
instead of your understanding biology

1037
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:59,570
absolutely yeah so so for example often

1038
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:02,929
before I would even begin a research

1039
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:06,590
project what I would ask the what I ask

1040
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:08,629
growers is what are your options how are

1041
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:11,900
you going to manage this what are the

1042
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,700
things you are likely to do and once I

1043
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,150
get those answers then I can actually

1044
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:18,409
target this study if if if they know

1045
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,420
it's a pseudo if they know it's

1046
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:23,480
bacterial and they only have two options

1047
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,840
for control that's all we need to know

1048
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,000
is it bacterial is it not right and so

1049
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,760
it really depends what options are

1050
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,710
available to the growers so with the

1051
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,220
mushroom growers they're very innovative

1052
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:40,610
they have they have some extra money so

1053
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:43,099
they would be willing to invest in

1054
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:45,680
products they would be willing to invest

1055
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:48,980
in development of products and so

1056
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:51,159
looking at for example these development

1057
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,500
of a bio control for them makes sense

1058
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:57,139
okay because that that high-value cash

1059
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,739
crop would make sense that wouldn't

1060
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:04,219
necessarily make sense for lettuce okay

1061
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:07,819
and so my first question is always to

1062
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,589
the producers what kinds of things do

1063
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,740
you have money for what kinds of things

1064
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:16,030
are you willing to do does that make

1065
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:16,029
sense is that answer your question

1066
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,450
totally we don't have any mushrooms

1067
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:26,179
produced in New York but sort of options

1068
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:30,079
to Pennsylvania mushroom growers have

1069
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:31,789
four control or reduction of bacterial

1070
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,069
diseases

1071
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,199
it's such a fun crop oh my goodness i

1072
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,780
when I moved to Pennsylvania I thought

1073
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:41,569
how lucky could a pseudomonas girl be

1074
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,960
right that you've got all these and an X

1075
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,820
pseudomonas is involved in the

1076
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,949
stimulation of mushroom growth so the

1077
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,990
actual fruiting body formation by the

1078
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:53,329
fungus is stimulated by Pseudomonas

1079
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:55,129
Pewter like organisms so that's a whole

1080
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:57,380
nother ball of wax right you don't want

1081
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:01,789
to kill off the good guys and you want

1082
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:03,710
to kill off the bad guys and so so one

1083
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,500
of the things that that conventional

1084
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:09,079
growers can use is chlorine II organic

1085
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,980
growers cannot use chlorine okay for

1086
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:16,250
example the the primary methods for

1087
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,199
control are sanitation steam so they

1088
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:23,599
steam their whole rooms they can steam

1089
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:26,569
the entire room and humidity control but

1090
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,639
that isn't optimal for like the the

1091
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,280
things that are optimal for pathogen

1092
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:33,529
control are not optimal for growth and

1093
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,920
so they're constantly doing this fine

1094
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:40,820
balance and in the organic systems they

1095
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,190
really tip toward disease often and so

1096
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,250
in fact we were just awarded a million

1097
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:49,280
dollar ory grant so that's the organic

1098
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,659
research extension initiative funding to

1099
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,500
work on this and a couple of other

1100
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:56,989
diseases in relationship to biological

1101
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:02,030
control in particular and microbiome

1102
00:47:56,989 --> 00:48:04,369
analysis more generally so they really

1103
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:06,350
have humidity control sanitation and

1104
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:08,809
chlorine and then if you take away

1105
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:11,509
chlorine for the organic folks its

1106
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:13,190
sanitation and humidity control and so

1107
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,430
they're really looking for other options

1108
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,019
and I think you know they're already

1109
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:19,579
starting to get a picture that that

1110
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:22,130
their disease problems are more

1111
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:25,250
complicated than they once thought right

1112
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,079
so that really is my job is to let

1113
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,579
people know that their disease problems

1114
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,440
are more complicated than they thought

1115
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:33,639
and they can't just deal with one

1116
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:37,300
breeder they need to work with us to

1117
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:39,789
curious how all this flux in taxonomy

1118
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,960
how that is intersected with

1119
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:44,809
international trade barriers of

1120
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,000
regulatory sort of things are they

1121
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:47,630
keeping up with the changes or are they

1122
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,829
yes

1123
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:55,289
not at all yeah in fact I have been

1124
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:57,659
working with a fasciculus

1125
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:58,889
just the permitting section to try to

1126
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:00,599
get them up-to-date and the

1127
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:03,359
understanding of what the bacterial

1128
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,460
taxonomy is because some of them really

1129
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,110
do understand it and as they bring new

1130
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,510
people in you know we want to make sure

1131
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,700
that they're up to date as well so I

1132
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,860
would have to look at my calendar but I

1133
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,739
believe there's a visit to a facade my

1134
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,079
calendar soon to give the whole two or

1135
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:23,129
three hour version of bacterial taxonomy

1136
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:25,319
at a glance yeah I the the folks from

1137
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,119
the pense the Penn State Department of

1138
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,460
Agriculture can't ask me to come and

1139
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,489
talk about bacterial taxonomy and I said

1140
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,639
to them well I feel like I've done an

1141
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:39,629
adequate job when I've talked for a week

1142
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:41,699
how long can I have right and so I know

1143
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,160
a week of bacterial taxonomy I always

1144
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:45,809
try to make it fun and so I've had a

1145
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,690
number of people come visit me for a

1146
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:50,969
week so that they can do it other

1147
00:49:48,690 --> 00:50:08,250
questions so now you know what

1148
00:49:50,969 --> 00:50:10,319
translational taxonomy is perhaps this

1149
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:15,889
has been a production of Cornell
