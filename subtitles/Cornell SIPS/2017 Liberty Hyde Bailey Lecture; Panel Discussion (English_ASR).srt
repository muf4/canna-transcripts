1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,929
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,929
University

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,539
well thank you that's a really exciting

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,600
talks one of the things that I noticed

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,788
is sort of a theme through all the talks

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,469
was the environmental sustainability

7
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:20,829
that's coming along with this food

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:24,168
revolution so in addition to having

9
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:26,118
fresh nutritious locally sourced foods

10
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:29,028
it's also a more environmentally

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,740
sustainable system in many cases Michael

12
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:33,170
can you talk a little bit more about the

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:38,149
food lack of food waste and how that's

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:41,390
helping environment yeah so in terms of

15
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:46,519
a lot of the energy we put into a farm

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,920
if you think about of what we our

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,070
presence on the planet means in terms of

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,890
the the water we use where we get

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,130
fertility for the crops to grow and

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,020
handle the cultivation all the energy

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,909
that goes into just kind of getting the

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,618
crop ready in the field one of the big

23
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:10,359
things we can do is to look at you know

24
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:13,670
how to use more of that and so there's a

25
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:16,748
work like I'm doing to be able to see

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,280
how we can get more of that to be edible

27
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:22,368
there's also the complementary work and

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,218
a lot I do it with Chris on trying to

29
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:27,259
look at how you can avoid some of the

30
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:32,239
diseases and testin might go in and

31
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:34,489
cause the great loss of that and the

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,170
flood moves in some diseases move in how

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:38,170
can you make plans more resilient and

34
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,780
what might happen through this season

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,780
and so as we're working on kind of

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,879
combining all those and then if we're

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,959
the links to the things that Thomas was

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,839
sharing about how you can look at some

39
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,868
of the supply chains and get more of

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,759
that crop kind of fitting into what

41
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:01,759
people are looking to buy in addition to

42
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:05,269
what I'm doing to try to encourage and

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,549
expand what is working really well in a

44
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:09,579
given environment and can be translated

45
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,709
to a dinner table

46
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,090
Thanks and yeah we'll get your questions

47
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,759
in just one second I wanted to bring up

48
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,689
one more point both Thomas

49
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,189
well actually Thomas Courtney and

50
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,859
Carman all brought up the point that

51
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:26,699
Cornell and cows does have a campus in

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,350
Geneva New York there's about 300 people

53
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,509
there working there now

54
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,400
and we're celebrating the Geneva Campus

55
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,799
is celebrating its one hundred and

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,469
thirty fifth anniversary this year and

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
and carmen i know you said that the high

58
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:43,199
pressure processing machine was there in

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,990
Geneva I'm interested to know I know you

60
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,389
said that the Teflon coating that could

61
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,719
be used to prevent bacteria from

62
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,399
sticking was increasing environmental

63
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,939
sustainability because you might not use

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,670
other other chemicals it's in any way

65
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:04,469
that the HPP machine increased

66
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:07,019
environmental sustainability in fact

67
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:10,830
many of these non-thermal we call the

68
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,740
non thermal technologies are not relying

69
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,850
on heat so because you don't have to put

70
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,840
so much thermal energy into the

71
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,120
processing and you don't have to cool

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,590
after that there are some savings

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,349
depending on the product depending on

74
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,670
how energy intensive the product is in

75
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:32,039
the end so both high pressure but also

76
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,319
other technologies like pulsed electric

77
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,379
field and other things that we are going

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,370
to use have been demonstrating certain

79
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,990
cases to reduce the use of energy

80
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,930
additionally with high pressure you

81
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,390
treat the product in package already so

82
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:53,010
it removes the need for repackaging

83
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,079
after that and also it increases shelf

84
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:57,000
life because you have treated the

85
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,890
products its terminal treatment you

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,719
don't have any post process

87
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,109
contamination so that could extend the

88
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,989
shelf life and also has the energy

89
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,090
benefit and just last comment on the

90
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:12,989
Teflon that was kind of a catchy phrase

91
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,810
from the media our surface actually is

92
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,819
not Teflon is like Teflon for bacteria

93
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,798
they called it you leave it to the media

94
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,389
to call it catch away but it's really

95
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:27,060
just metallic surface it's a metal oxide

96
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:29,149
let's cool so other questions from the

97
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,149
audience

98
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:41,269
it's a two-part question what is your

99
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:45,050
definition of local and does the

100
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:47,598
definition of local eventually hurt them

101
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:57,499
marketing-wise because they can only be

102
00:04:47,598 --> 00:05:00,168
local common as a local is a term that's

103
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:02,149
not legally defined of course so it

104
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:04,338
means whatever the consumer needs it to

105
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,889
mean and there are many attributes of

106
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:11,449
local many reasons people want to buy

107
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:14,509
local and it depends which one is most

108
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,520
important depends on the store so one of

109
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:18,259
the attributes of local is that it's

110
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,778
fresher so if you're interested in the

111
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,430
freshness of your produce buying it so

112
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:26,058
that it traveled less is an important

113
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,680
criterion there but it can also be that

114
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,539
you want to feel a connectedness to the

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,158
community if you live in a small town

116
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,808
you want to know that this person went

117
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:35,418
to school with your mother grew the

118
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:37,789
thing that is an important aspect of

119
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:40,609
local in some situations less so in big

120
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:42,680
cities but there's also the regional

121
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,080
connectedness the regional identity this

122
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,930
comes from my place and that's really

123
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:52,818
very important to people and how far my

124
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,649
place extends depends on the type of

125
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:59,019
community you have and you end up with

126
00:05:54,649 --> 00:06:01,249
some oddity so in New York City in the

127
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,199
restaurant foodservice trade they use

128
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:05,778
the pride of New York label as their

129
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,939
indicator of local so if it comes from

130
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:12,649
Buffalo it's local but if it comes from

131
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:14,869
northern New Jersey it's not so that's a

132
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:19,968
cultural definition of local so those

133
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:22,699
the exact definition depends on what the

134
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:23,778
quality of localness is that somebody is

135
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,459
after and there are many different

136
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:27,680
legitimate ones they have to be

137
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:30,860
addressed and do you think that impacts

138
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,199
markets so sort of the fog oh it impacts

139
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,180
markets tremendously you see in the here

140
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
in the supermarkets where we are out in

141
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,408
the country they'll put pictures of the

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,220
farmer in which little town the farm is

143
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:46,490
in to develop that connected

144
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:56,690
because we take the fresh for granted in

145
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:58,850
the summertime anyway about what impact

146
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:00,740
climate change may have on your plant

147
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,550
breeding focus as it relates to crop

148
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:10,730
adaptation and pest resistance or

149
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:13,520
managing pests so we're seeing in the in

150
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,370
the berry world not only climate change

151
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,769
changing the climate pattern so

152
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,930
California has just went through a large

153
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:25,250
drought period of course now that's been

154
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:28,129
broken last summer here didn't rain also

155
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,129
for weeks and weeks and this year hasn't

156
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:35,209
stopped raining so it's certainly what

157
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:39,019
we see in the pest side of things the

158
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:43,099
pressure changes a lot if you add into

159
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:46,159
that the the reduction in use of what we

160
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,820
call fumigants and these are used in a

161
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,680
lot of the berry production to to reduce

162
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,019
the pests in the soil before they plant

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,699
many of these chemicals are harmful to

164
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,709
the environment and so they're phasing

165
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,250
them out in many places and now so we

166
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:05,029
have the berry growers and very breeders

167
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,529
have had to concentrate more resources

168
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,389
toward making sure the plant can

169
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,459
withstand diseases that they used to

170
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,649
just avoid through their production

171
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:16,000
practices so having better route

172
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:22,189
tolerance to heavier soils to pathogens

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,519
to wet and dry climate and then being

174
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:28,009
able to breed varieties that will grow

175
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,810
in more modern production systems such

176
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,000
as the protected agriculture of the

177
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,769
tunnels because the things that grow

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,539
well in the field don't necessarily grow

179
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,179
well under those conditions and so

180
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,668
combining both production practices with

181
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,098
some of the environmental problems has

182
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:47,509
has really changed my focus on how we

183
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,490
deal with it I just add a little bit to

184
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:51,110
that now throughout the president plant

185
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,950
breeding we're always finding the the

186
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,169
best of the best and tightening of

187
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,240
with so once once in a great attributes

188
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,740
and another plant that has something's a

189
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,590
compliment that they'll add to that when

190
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,830
they're cross together so for me I'm

191
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,750
increasingly looking to more global

192
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,520
sources for plants that might not be I

193
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,659
might not be crossing to plants that are

194
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,529
that's exactly the same you might

195
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,600
confuse them if you see them as being

196
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,699
the same but looking at some of the more

197
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,279
kind of wilder versions or the versions

198
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,860
of a cucumber that a different culture

199
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,230
would use in India Thailand where

200
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,820
they're having many of these climate

201
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,970
conditions we're bracing ourselves for

202
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,700
and making those making that exchange

203
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,220
between cultures at the seed level in

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,540
our food that's how I'm kind of bringing

205
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,160
the resilience I probably have the

206
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,929
easiest one on that one because we're

207
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,299
breeding for tolerance to warmer nights

208
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:50,139
and that is clearly one of the trends

209
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:52,929
that we're seeing so having that trait

210
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,759
developed in this particular crop that's

211
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,199
going to help continue to have

212
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,929
production in the areas where it's

213
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
continuing we're also of course looking

214
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,120
at ways to raise the crop that have

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,159
lower impacts on climate change that are

216
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,799
better better storage of carbon that's

217
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,000
that's a piece of the production also so

218
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,000
we're looking at both ends

219
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:57,100
well certainly the locally-sourced

220
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:59,679
movement has in the east it's been very

221
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,389
very strong and I think in the Pacific

222
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,959
Northwest it's also been very very

223
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,850
strong part of that availability because

224
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,950
they can grow a lot of horticultural

225
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,230
crops and so then that people start to

226
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,780
think well why are we getting it from so

227
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,539
far away

228
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,870
obviously in December berries are not

229
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:23,349
really sore scible from New York for the

230
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,419
most part in January February so that

231
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,470
certainly is part of it part of its the

232
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,389
environmental part of it

233
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,639
part of it is if people think well what

234
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,409
doesn't make sense to grow things and

235
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,240
ship it in a truck all the way across

236
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,529
the country

237
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,990
unfortunately the economics and the

238
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,990
carbon footprint doesn't always match

239
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,659
that because there are yield differences

240
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,519
in different places and strawberries in

241
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:47,679
California yield about three times as

242
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,929
much per acre as they do in New York and

243
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:56,079
so that balance for the carbon footprint

244
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:59,199
may not be as advantageous because it's

245
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,850
not just about shipping so it's a

246
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,650
combination of the shipping part of it

247
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:10,139
and the quality part of it that we're

248
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:10,139
trying to combine others may come in

249
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:32,120
yeah microphone I have I have a question

250
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:36,019
and a comment I've been a faithful eater

251
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,990
broccoli for numerous years and then I

252
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:41,929
found a chart by the center of Disease

253
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,839
Control that said watercress was a

254
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:48,888
hundred percent nutrient dense and

255
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:51,250
broccoli 38 so I was wondering are you

256
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:55,610
doing any work with watercraft

257
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,110
as being higher nutrition I mean I

258
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,070
didn't realize that been eating broccoli

259
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,550
forever yeah I think part of it is that

260
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,560
a lot of the nutrients are in the green

261
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:09,979
part of the plants and with broccoli the

262
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:13,189
center of the stem doesn't have as much

263
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,110
of some of the vitamins that they're

264
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:20,990
counting in their nutrient density

265
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:23,570
calculation but one of the trade-offs of

266
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,310
course is that it's easier to eat a lot

267
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,980
you can easily eat three times as much

268
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:32,679
broccoli as watercress in most

269
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:36,379
situations so so in terms of the total

270
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,838
nutrient impact they end up being

271
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:43,629
similar the crucifer in general are

272
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:46,760
pretty good I wanted to make a comment I

273
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:49,338
received my nutrition degree from here

274
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,259
40 years ago and develop the Lean

275
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,709
Cuisine products for Stouffer's the

276
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:57,319
first 10 but I retired end of December

277
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,278
2015 and went to India on a medical

278
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,269
missions trip

279
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:04,309
the doctors dentists and nurses and one

280
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,519
of the areas were going up the stairs to

281
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:09,439
Center and my hug someone from my team

282
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,078
said look out the window and I saw all

283
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
this rubble from the construction

284
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,948
breaking down demolishes and they said

285
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,129
the children lives there there's no

286
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:20,778
bathroom nothing food water and they

287
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,490
come every day and they get one hot meal

288
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:26,208
make a shower in the area that I was

289
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,519
working at and I was sad and then I said

290
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,889
to myself I'll just

291
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,909
happy for them right now and do whatever

292
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,689
I can right now

293
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:39,419
and came home this is a year ago and

294
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:43,590
there was an email 3.5 million dollars

295
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:48,610
given to malnourished children in India

296
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:52,930
given to the AG and the nutrition human

297
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:56,560
that by Bill Gates so it is just so

298
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:58,659
exciting and the agricultural school is

299
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,639
going to find ways of growing more on

300
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:02,289
things for the people and then our

301
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,480
nutrition group is going to provide

302
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:07,689
better food for them but it was just so

303
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,970
wonderful so happy so I went back to

304
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,020
India again this year and Beck thinks

305
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,220
because we go next year but it's fun

306
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,679
thank you very much for sharing that

307
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,769
story actually it's a real pleasure of

308
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,409
ours to interact with folks at Cal's

309
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:26,259
international programs many of the folks

310
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:29,409
across scales are not only focused on

311
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,419
you know communities here in in New York

312
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:34,559
but across the US and around the world

313
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:34,559
so thank you for sharing that

314
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:17,959
I don't think there's a based on what I

315
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:21,048
saw in the NA s report there's no

316
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:22,758
evidence at all for for the fact that

317
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:24,739
it's genetically modified being the

318
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,188
causal agents of that it's of course

319
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:42,290
it's some of those public health trends

320
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:44,808
are remain rather mysterious we didn't

321
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:47,208
have the Apple iPhone either so I mean

322
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:49,129
there's a lot of there's a lot of things

323
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,188
that have changed in our society besides

324
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:56,199
our food source and and a lot of that

325
00:16:52,188 --> 00:17:00,318
hat is are we become more sedentary

326
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:04,908
which is not good for your health we've

327
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:08,359
changed our eating habits so it's really

328
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:10,909
hard to pinpoint specific things what we

329
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,028
have seen in the last 10 years is

330
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:15,679
increased consumption of produce and the

331
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:17,778
government has been trying to get people

332
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,350
to eat more produce because we feel good

333
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:23,209
for you

334
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:27,558
so making cause-and-effect connections

335
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:29,179
is very very challenging in those kinds

336
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,119
of situations when you have population

337
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,950
size that we do that's also changed and

338
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:38,148
that's changing rapidly worldwide as

339
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,278
well I don't think you'll find that the

340
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:43,189
percentages of people with Crohn's

341
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:44,960
disease for instance has gone up but

342
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,788
there's more people and more people are

343
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,440
much more aware of it and so we hear a

344
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:50,808
lot more about it too and so I think

345
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,620
that as a big part as well our news

346
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:57,079
cycle has changed tremendously to a you

347
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:59,479
know that if it bleeds it leads has

348
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,629
changed into all aspects of the news

349
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,889
that we get and so it's a little

350
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,480
challenging for us that scientists we

351
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:08,298
see the scientific evidence has not

352
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,000
backed up some of the news that is in

353
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:12,819
the cycle

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,170
yeah you know they said so then it's

355
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:20,019
there's you know it's probably a it's a

356
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,240
an active and necessary area of inquiry

357
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:25,329
into kind of what are the things that

358
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,710
sensitize us or kind of increase the

359
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:28,689
likelihood that someone will develop

360
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,210
these things and kind of figure out what

361
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,759
are what are those how can we avoid them

362
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,039
how can we minimize them and think about

363
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,289
just all the complexity Courtney said

364
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,849
about some of the lifestyle things

365
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:42,009
there's a lot of news we've looked about

366
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:45,519
the chemicals we interact with in our

367
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:47,710
daily live and so on food

368
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,720
there's also chemicals that we're

369
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,090
looking at to see which ones are we

370
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,120
interacting with and which ones might be

371
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,349
triggers or not and for different people

372
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,779
which and we're all different we'll

373
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:02,019
respond to things differently also but

374
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:05,349
you know looking at a vast spectrum of a

375
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:08,589
very complicated system and trying to

376
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:10,449
tease out of course how can we change

377
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:13,809
the things that might be triggers of

378
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,940
such things to help you know in all the

379
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,639
ways the food impacts us and their

380
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,460
environment impact yes and in addition

381
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,800
to finding out causes we're also working

382
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,630
on solutions we have folks across the

383
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:30,940
college and in human ecology as well

384
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,710
nutritionists looking at how can we help

385
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,019
the folks that have been diagnosed with

386
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,870
these issues we have folks breeding

387
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:40,509
specifically for people that have gluten

388
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:42,639
issues so how can we breed crops that

389
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,039
can then be used by our food science

390
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,470
colleagues to produce gluten-free foods

391
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,539
so we absolutely are recognizing the

392
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,529
issues that exist and working towards

393
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:57,700
scientific solutions for the problem

394
00:19:52,529 --> 00:20:00,190
other questions so I have oh is there

395
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,819
one more I have flash questions for that

396
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,710
for the panel to finish us up today I'd

397
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:09,099
like to ask the question about food

398
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,569
safety at farmer's markets especially if

399
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:14,439
you're buying foods that you're not

400
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:16,960
going to cook or heat treat do you how

401
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,470
does the panel feel about the food

402
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,980
safety on a farmers market versus in a

403
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,980
supermarket

404
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:32,269
well it turns out my wife is the

405
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:34,789
national leader in developing food

406
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:37,940
safety programs for farmers and that

407
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,740
extends from the small plane farmers

408
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,470
Amish Mennonite all the way to the

409
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,609
multinational corporation it is

410
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:51,350
certainly a concern and it is Cornell

411
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:53,539
its leading the way in in developing

412
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:59,299
programs for farmers to actually have a

413
00:20:53,539 --> 00:21:01,940
plan on how to avoid contaminating their

414
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,190
produce certainly it's in the news when

415
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,350
there's an outbreak in spinach or melons

416
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,740
or strawberries or whatever it hits the

417
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:11,899
news cycle instantaneously and it scares

418
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,240
people on it and it's what's reason you

419
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,500
don't want to find out that you fed your

420
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,779
child something that's going to make

421
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:22,309
them sick so part of that is federal

422
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,910
government has actually come out with a

423
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:28,009
new new law they call it FISMA Food

424
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,630
Safety Modernization Act most of you

425
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:32,599
probably don't know about it and don't

426
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,420
have to know about it but Cornell is

427
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,000
part of that process of getting rules

428
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,840
and helping farmers put together plans

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,319
so that they can be as safe as possible

430
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:47,689
there is no such thing as no risk on a

431
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,240
farm it just you can't eliminate it

432
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,880
completely because food is grown in the

433
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,009
ground but farmers are very aware of

434
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,920
this no farmer wants to make their

435
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:59,839
customer sick it will destroy them and

436
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,330
so they are they're a lot more careful

437
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,819
than they were 10 years ago and they

438
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:08,269
will be continued to implement a lot of

439
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:10,460
these plans I think for most of the

440
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:12,500
local stuff especially the thing that

441
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,000
you can take some comfort in as most of

442
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,609
these farmers are eating their produce

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,109
before they're selling it to you because

444
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:21,529
they're feeding their own families with

445
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:26,750
it as well it's certainly a concern

446
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:28,700
though so it's much less awkward for me

447
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,410
to say than Kourtney but Cornell

448
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,529
takes an amazing sense of pride in our

449
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,720
leadership in good agricultural

450
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,558
practices and food safety in addition to

451
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,110
Kourtney's wife

452
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,288
Betsie been the entire department of

453
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:44,928
food science has just really led I think

454
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:46,849
the state the country in the world and

455
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:49,669
good agricultural practices and safe

456
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:51,918
food in fact the state of New York is

457
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:54,080
really leading the world our our state

458
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,809
partners have funded much of the work

459
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,480
and research as well so if it's a really

460
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:03,859
revolutionary area for corner for

461
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,990
Cornell Inc and calzone so my flash

462
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:09,079
questions Oklahoma okay I was just

463
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:12,200
wondering the timeframe in terms of the

464
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,928
enactment of that Modernization Act and

465
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,028
how that's reaching us in the

466
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,710
marketplace we can our food safety has

467
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,599
dropped so the question about the Food

468
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,480
Safety Modernization Act that is being

469
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,939
implemented as we speak so they have

470
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,788
been training for the last six seven

471
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,249
months now around the country they've

472
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:33,408
been doing a lot of train the trainers

473
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:35,808
so in that process you train other

474
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:38,990
people who can then go out and train

475
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:42,440
even more people and so that process is

476
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:45,409
ongoing as we speak and my wife Betsy

477
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,240
has been traveling a lot in the last six

478
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:51,379
months all over the country they've

479
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,419
covered about 30 of the states now most

480
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:56,240
of those you'll notice around the edge

481
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,700
the center part of the country and the

482
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,308
Upper West doesn't grow a whole lot of

483
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,399
produce but they will get to all of the

484
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:09,048
states by the end of this year with

485
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:11,538
trainings and so big the rules are going

486
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:13,638
coming into place I think some of them

487
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:16,009
are for the larger farms by the end of

488
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:17,479
this year and then all the whole process

489
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:22,509
by the end of next year it's been a

490
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:26,569
multi-year rollout of those regulations

491
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:28,878
it's coming from other countries so

492
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:30,499
there is an international there is an

493
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:32,298
international section of this and

494
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:34,850
international farms have to meet the

495
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:37,278
same standards and so they are training

496
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:38,748
people outside the country as well who

497
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,950
import food into the United States

498
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:44,200
because they will have to follow the

499
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:47,569
same and they really are they monitored

500
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,778
monitoring is always a

501
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:53,210
what you'll find is that you know we get

502
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:54,288
a lot of produce from Mexico and people

503
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,700
worry about oh we're getting this

504
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:58,460
produce from Mexico what do they do in

505
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,110
Mexico that we don't know allow turns

506
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,120
out most of the company's growing in

507
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:03,949
Mexico are companies that are growing in

508
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,898
California as well and so they have an

509
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,179
integrated food safety plan throughout

510
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:12,048
the company and so they do the exact

511
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:14,720
same the exact same thing in Mexico as

512
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:18,109
they do in in California or Arizona or

513
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,538
somewhere else because they're putting

514
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,759
produce into the same stream so when

515
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:24,470
Driscoll sells strawberries whether they

516
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,509
come from California or Florida or

517
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,690
Mexico they want to have the same

518
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:32,509
standards everywhere because they can't

519
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,308
afford not to because they have worked

520
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:36,769
really hard and spent a lot of money to

521
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:39,619
get their name to be recognized as

522
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:41,329
something of quality and I think you'll

523
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:45,018
see the same with companies like dole

524
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:47,869
and and and some of these big produce

525
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:51,200
companies they they are very very

526
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:53,089
careful about their reputation so so as

527
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,200
a consumer what are the top things I

528
00:25:53,089 --> 00:26:02,148
should be looking for thinking about

529
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:04,759
okay the top things I mean anybody has

530
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:07,459
nothing I think eating enough produce is

531
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,230
probably more important than worrying

532
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,500
about where the produce comes from I

533
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,599
think most of us don't eat enough

534
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:19,970
produce so I've been told that I need to

535
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:22,339
wrap up my one of my last lightening

536
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,929
questions as scientists when we give

537
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,759
talks the last thing we always do is

538
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:28,159
acknowledge the folks who have funded

539
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,509
our work so I was going to ask each of

540
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,130
them but I won't because I know it will

541
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:33,740
take too long I'm going to give a

542
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,289
running list of what I know has been

543
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,298
funded and throughout cows were funded

544
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:40,730
by the growers of the state of New York

545
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:42,888
many many different grower groups we're

546
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,808
funded by industry we have many industry

547
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:46,369
partners that are willing to help fund

548
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:48,138
the work because it's important to what

549
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:50,028
happens to them we're funded by the

550
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:52,339
United States Department of Agriculture

551
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:54,259
federal funding sources the National

552
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:56,269
Science Foundation the National

553
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,950
Institutes of Health the state of New

554
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:00,139
York provides a significant amount of

555
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,549
funding

556
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,420
and the College of Agriculture and life

557
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:12,230
sciences and with that I'd like to thank

558
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:15,259
our panel members again this has been a

559
