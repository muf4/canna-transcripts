00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,330
this is a production of Cornell

00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:05,330
University

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:14,300
okay thank you Kevin I'm going to

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,490
continue our discussion of kicker popipo

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,560
and talk about the work that I've been

6
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:22,089
doing looking at resistance to the

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,859
disease fight after a crown and root rot

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:27,528
so the causal agent of this disease is

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:31,278
fight off the reCAPTCHA C which infects

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:33,609
a wide variety of plants including many

11
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:37,640
economically important vegetable crops

12
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:41,390
such as most Sala nation species all

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,520
cucurbits and some legumes as well which

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,340
other campesi can infect all plant

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,200
organs and causes different symptoms the

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,810
most important of which I'm showing on

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,450
this slide we see fruit rot on the left

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,420
the white growth that you see is the

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,300
pathogen sporulating and I'm focusing on

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,719
crown and root rat symptoms of which we

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,789
see on the right common root rot causes

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,310
dampening off symptoms and young

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,640
seedlings but also affects more mature

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,700
plants causing lesions on the roots and

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,409
stems which lead to wilting and plant

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,719
death so in pepper there are sources of

27
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,429
very high disease resistance that are

28
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:24,259
used in breeding and there have been

29
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:26,748
there's been a lot of work looking at

30
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:30,170
the genetics of disease resistance but

31
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:34,638
much less is known in orbit acÃ¡ although

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,530
many accessions many urban species have

33
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,789
been screened for either fur trap

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,789
resistance or root and Crown rot

35
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:42,259
resistance and there's a wide amount of

36
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:44,450
variation in terms of degree of

37
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:47,118
acceptability although there are very

38
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,689
few cases of cleared complete resistance

39
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,938
to the pathogen so my work is focused on

40
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:55,158
Cucurbita pepo which as we learned more

41
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:57,648
in include zucchini and pumpkin among

42
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,109
other market classes of squash and I

43
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:01,759
think people there are no sources of

44
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:04,938
complete resistance to this disease that

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,429
have been identified and most cultivars

46
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:09,908
are highly susceptible to light after a

47
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:09,908
rubyprogram

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,899
so here at Cornell in the Missouri lab

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,170
in recent years there's been work to

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,629
develop pumpkin and zucchini lines with

51
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:25,949
an increased amount of resistance to fit

52
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:28,849
under it crown and regret and the most

53
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:32,549
promising lines which I'm working with

54
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:35,159
for my research were derived from across

55
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,200
between zucchini cultivar Romulus and a

56
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,079
gray zucchini landrace from a national

57
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,959
plant germplasm system in the picture we

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
can see on the Left one of the advanced

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,150
lines compared to susceptible zucchini

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,930
fratty Dungey and these advanced lines

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,300
are partially resistant in that disease

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,849
program progresses more slowly and

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,090
symptoms are reduced but we still

64
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,049
observe plant mortality on many plants

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,270
of these genotypes

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,270
however they perform better than the

67
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,300
topic sessions from a previous study

68
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,850
that evaluated several hundred different

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,100
people germ plasm equations i've also

70
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,829
challenged these breeding lines with

71
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,169
seven diverse pathogen isolates and the

72
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,870
response to disease is consistent

73
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:26,939
indicating the absence of any isolate

74
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,069
specific interactions so one of the

75
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,859
goals of my research is to identify

76
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,169
low-side that control resistance to

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,000
photographer crown and regret and do

78
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,548
that I've developed an F to matthew

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,219
population we can see the parents and

80
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,739
the f1 on the left that's acceptable

81
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:46,799
parent is zucchini variety Dungey in the

82
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,439
middle we have the breeding line that I

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,830
previously identified as being most

84
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,250
resistant and on the right is the f1 the

85
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,440
figure on the right shows area under the

86
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,049
disease progress curve on the parents

87
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,219
and f1 area under the news progress

88
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,340
curve is a measurement of disease

89
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,870
progression over time in this case using

90
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,120
measurements of disease incidents every

91
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,659
other day for two three weeks following

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,409
inoculation we can see that f1 is not

93
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,939
intermediate between the parents but is

94
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:20,298
closer in phenotype to the sensible

95
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,310
parent and we can also see that the

96
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,089
differences between the parents are

97
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,170
robust to

98
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,679
differences in the mountain

99
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,050
concentration where even evacuating

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
partially resistant parent with

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,860
suspension of a hundred thousand zones

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,120
first four mill we observe less disease

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,680
than on the susceptible parent

104
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,860
inoculated with a suspension of 1000 per

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,870
mil so we expect the genetic

106
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,340
architecture of this trait to be complex

107
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,019
and with that in mind we are employing

108
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,089
Volks aggregate analysis with all

109
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,509
generally sequencing of the books to map

110
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,589
QTL the idea behind this is

111
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,050
straightforward the consists of

112
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,339
evaluating a large number of plants

113
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,168
identifying the phenotypic extremes in

114
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,349
this case the most susceptible and the

115
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:09,839
most resistant sequencing those DNA

116
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,700
pools from those bulks estimating allele

117
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,989
frequencies genome-wide and identifying

118
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,349
regions that if between the books so

119
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,780
there can be several advantages in some

120
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,389
cases over traditional QTL mapping where

121
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,819
all individuals are phenotyped and gene

122
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,650
typed separately that is because your

123
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:32,490
gene typing fear and vidual x' gene

124
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:35,129
typing costs are lesser phenotyping is

125
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,290
also simpler in the sense that instead

126
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:40,139
of assigning a precise if is explored

127
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,030
all individuals it just requires the

128
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,599
researcher to identify the fugitive

129
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:49,139
extremes there can be a statistical

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,300
challenge in separating signal in allele

131
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,639
frequency differences between bulks from

132
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,759
sampling noise from sequencing but

133
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,110
several methods have been developed that

134
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,149
increase the accuracy of allele

135
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,979
frequency estimates at snips by

136
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:05,609
borrowing information from neighboring

137
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:08,038
murders so this slide shows how I

138
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,300
implemented this approach in the f2

139
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:16,849
population I mentioned earlier I

140
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:21,180
evaluated over 13,000 f2 seedlings I

141
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:24,689
sprang them with a suspension of taffeta

142
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,120
cap to see those cores and identified

143
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:30,329
bulks not just as acceptable and

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,189
resistant but also a random bulk to

145
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:36,180
estimate baseline allele frequencies in

146
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:37,110
the population and attempted to have the

147
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,348
books

148
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:44,098
15% of the population selection was

149
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:46,860
applied in each 72 cell trade the plants

150
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,250
were so did so that corresponds to 11

151
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,310
plants in each tray being selected for

152
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,129
the books and then tissue from for the

153
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,740
plants was poked DNA was extracted and

154
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm currently quantifying it and

155
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,460
standardizing across 96 trays to end up

156
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,620
with 6 DNA pools the 3 books from both

157
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:12,538
stages of phenotyping that will shortly

158
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,658
be submitted for sequencing I'm also

159
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:19,408
interested in the mechanisms that allow

160
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:21,538
plants of these partially resistant gene

161
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:23,339
types to have a higher probability of

162
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,628
survival compared to other gene types

163
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,429
and previous work has shown that

164
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:32,009
structural and physical features in

165
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,408
roots and stems are involved in

166
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,199
resistance to fight African root rot and

167
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:40,348
a previous experiment using peppers

168
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,468
showed that pethor catalyst Ezell spores

169
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:46,468
were able to attach to and germinate

170
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:50,519
equally on roots of both acceptable and

171
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:52,439
resistance efforts septal peppers the

172
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,588
pathogen was able to penetrate into the

173
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,658
interior of resistant gene types growth

174
00:07:55,588 --> 00:08:02,189
was limited to the outer cell layers of

175
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:04,620
the cortex so this summer with the help

176
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:07,978
of undergraduate interns who worked on

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,338
this project we used a green fluorescent

178
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:13,949
protein tagged isolate and on follicle

179
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:16,319
laser scanning microscopy to look at the

180
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:19,650
infection process in both one of our

181
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,098
partially resistant breeding lines 1709

182
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:26,338
and the susceptible teeny variety gunga

183
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:30,478
we looked at 96 taproot cross-sections

184
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:33,208
and gave them a binary score of -

185
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,759
present or absent in route interiors and

186
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,889
in the vascular tissue and both 3 days

187
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,958
post inoculation and 6 days post

188
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,559
inoculation we observed higher

189
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,809
probability observing high peak in

190
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,169
either the interior or the vascular

191
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,489
tissue in our sensible rat dungeon but

192
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:53,759
we still observed -

193
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,590
intentional portion of parsley resistant

194
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,509
breeding lines and I think this is

195
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,780
interesting because whereas in the

196
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:03,000
greenhouse we observed almost all of the

197
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,549
dungeon plans to be dead by seven days

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,120
post inoculation by a couple of weeks

199
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:12,419
post inoculation we only deserved a 20%

200
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,370
the partial we resistant bring line to

201
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,589
be dead although we observed many more

202
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,139
of the plants to have pathogen present

203
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:24,300
in the interior of the route so it seems

204
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:26,220
that penetration the pathogen is limited

205
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,469
in the personally resistant gene type

206
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,009
and that the plants able to continue to

207
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:35,759
grow and survive despite infection

208
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:37,710
compared to the susceptible variety so

209
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,559
my next steps are currently developing

210
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,639
additional method populations that I

211
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,049
will use to validate any QTL that I'm

212
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,120
able to detect in the books arrogant

213
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:51,120
experiment and to estimate their effects

214
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,320
and I also hope to continue to do some

215
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,940
additional microscopy experiments and

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,700
differential gene expression analysis to

217
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,330
further understand what makes a

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,670
resistant plant more resistant so with

219
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,970
that I'd like to thank the smart and

220
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,539
Core labs my other members of my

221
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,509
committee

222
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:13,919
Michael is Erick and Philip Messer Carla

223
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,620
plant in Missouri lab who I collaborate

224
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,169
with from these projects ignition and

225
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,429
smart lab Holly Lang Ella Reeves was the

226
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:22,649
undergraduate who worked on the

227
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:23,669
microscope experiments and funding from

228
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:43,829
a New York State Department of

229
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:45,049
Agriculture and markets before you know

230
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:57,110
it seems like you that board

231
00:10:45,049 --> 00:11:02,419
diversification or I mean other issues

232
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,669
specific resistance like being issued to

233
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:09,439
there's there's evidence in pepper for

234
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:11,860
very specific resistance there's there's

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,650
not much evidence in tributes I

236
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,360
evaluated I looked at response these are

237
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,799
some distant Alliance mostly its

238
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,810
horizons from New York but also a couple

239
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,279
isil's from the west coast and the

240
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:24,279
response was the same in all cases

241
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,840
plants died do you have any idea what

242
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,949
the difference is in those plants was

243
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:46,639
there for IV or or just what the cause

244
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:50,090
was I I don't know in part I think

245
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,029
there's there's kind of maybe a

246
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,290
threshold in terms of infection and

247
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,970
there's variation in terms of how many

248
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,949
plants of the same gene type reach that

249
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,410
threshold and end up dying and we see

250
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,940
that in pepper as well but I'm

251
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,159
interested in maybe using quantitative

252
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,640
PCR to try to estimate adjoin abundance

253
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,179
and associate that with survival there's

254
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,179
no more questions

255
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:17,179
