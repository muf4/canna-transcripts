00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,359
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,359
University.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
Okay, good morning everyone and thank

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,320
you Mora for that introduction. I'm very

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
excited to talk to you all today about

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,480
some of the work that my lab is doing

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:25,839
and turning to um tomato's genetic past

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,599
to improve traits for for its future.

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,839
So let's see now before we get started I

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,558
just want to um thank the grad students

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,719
for the opportunity to present here

12
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,878
today. It's it's really an honor. Um

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,359
when I was a grad student these symposia

14
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,960
were a highlight of my graduate career.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
Um this is the first one that I attended

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,759
in 2016. The the theme that year was

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,719
breeding for the emerging global middle

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,198
class. That year I had the opportunity

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,198
to nominate and ultimately invite a

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,599
scientist whose work I really deeply

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,079
admired. That's Frank Mangan at the

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
University of Massachusetts Amherst who

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
devoted his career to reaching out to

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
immigrant populations in the northeast

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
United States uh developing market

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,960
opportunities for new vegetable crops

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,399
for for those communities. Um I I I

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,039
learned recently that that Frank passed

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
away last year. Um this symposium gave

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
me the chance to meet him in person,

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
hear a wonderful seminar. So, you know,

32
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,879
to be on the other side of that and

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,560
presenting today, it's really meaningful

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,879
to me. So, thank you all for the

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,719
opportunity and and thank you for for

36
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,719
sponsoring these these wonderful

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,840
programs. So, I was also excited as a

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,359
new tomato breeder to hear the theme of

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,359
of this year's symposium. Um, maybe I'm

40
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,759
biased because of what I work on, but I

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,519
think tomato is really a model for the

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,159
conservation, characterization, and

43
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,920
utilization of of wild relatives in in

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,280
plant breeding. Um, thanks to the

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,280
efforts of pioneering geneticists like

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,879
Charlie Rick who collected thousands of

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,560
excessions um, both wild and

48
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:03,118
domesticated of tomato. Um, we have

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
access to to excellent germplasm

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,599
resources in gene banks. Um, wild

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
relatives of tomato have been used to

52
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,519
answer fundamental questions about

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,039
evolutionary biology like the evolution

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,360
of self- incompatibility and

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,719
interpacific

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,480
incompatibility. And breeders have used

57
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,878
these genetic resources for at this

58
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,199
point almost 100 years to identify um

59
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,959
traits of agonomic importance in wild

60
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,598
relatives and bring them into

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,598
domesticated tomato.

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,480
So just to give a really high level

63
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,759
outline of my talk today. Um I want to

64
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,639
share a little bit about the genetic

65
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,318
history of tomato. Um before going into

66
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,919
kind of what the modern US tomato

67
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,919
industry looks like and where the

68
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,639
research that my lab is doing um where

69
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,679
we aim to kind of fit in there. I'm

70
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,238
going to talk about two different

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,879
projects that that we're working on. one

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,439
looking at uh you know a very um

73
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,120
diverged tomato wild relative and

74
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,680
looking at sources of abiotic stress

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,280
tolerance there and then also going you

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
know more recently into tomato's

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,239
evolutionary past and breeding modern

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
varieties for quality and beauty using

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,759
heirloom genetics and then finally I'll

80
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,518
talk about some of the challenges that

81
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,639
we're facing and what I think

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
possibilities are for the

83
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,799
future so they're generally considered

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,158
to be 16 spec species that are wild

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,319
relatives of tomato. These are found in

86
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,840
western South America where populations

87
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:35,158
of these grow from the western slopes of

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,640
the Andes to the coast. Um, two of these

89
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,039
species are also uh found exclusively on

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,439
the Galapagos Islands. These species

91
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,280
occupy a variety of different uh

92
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,359
ecological niches and grow in a variety

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
of different uh microclimates that

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,519
people have um characterized extensively

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
uh considering you know what that could

96
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
mean in terms of their potential impact

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
for tomato

98
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,000
breeding. So in terms of the

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
domestication of tomato for for a long

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
time it's been recognized that the most

101
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,719
closely related wild relative is senam

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,879
pipanelopolium which you can see on the

103
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,479
left here. This species produces small

104
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,479
maybe P-shaped fruit that ripen to a red

105
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,120
color. Um, but there's also been this

106
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,120
other uh botanical variety of tomato

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,040
called selenium like a persicum variety

108
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,120
sassif that grows either as a cultivated

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
plant through South America, Central

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,240
America, Mexico or it grows in wild

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,360
populations or as like a weedy species

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,079
in relation to to human habitats.

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
And um it's been proposed that this

114
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,199
botanical variety was kind of an

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,160
evolutionary intermediate in the

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,120
domestication of tomato from selenium

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,720
pibanelopolium. But the exact nature of

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,319
where and how that happened has been

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
under uh debate for a little

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,959
bit. One of the most recent theories

121
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,719
that's come out um proposes a pretty

122
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,319
complicated story of how tomato was

123
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
domesticated.

124
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,120
uh but it it the story that they present

125
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,519
is is most psimmonious with the genetic

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,879
data that we have. So what the authors

127
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,799
of this paper proposed is that um tens

128
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,759
of thousands of years ago before humans

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
arrived to South America, ancestral

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,600
populations of selenium pimpanelopolium

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,759
migrated to Mexico um acquired different

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,639
traits adaptations to a new climate

133
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,439
along the way um and diverged into this

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
new species like a persicum uh variety

135
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,600
Sarasa for. And then tens of thousands

136
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
of years later, it moved back to South

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
America, but this time in a much shorter

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
time span, probably carried by humans

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,720
who are also carrying other early

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,319
domesticated crops such as

141
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,400
mace. Back in South America, it

142
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,639
hybridized with wild populations of

143
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,478
selenium

144
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,918
pippinellopolium. Um the native people

145
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,478
of South America might have um selected

146
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,680
and um domesticated selenium like a

147
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,519
persum uh strassopform at that point. It

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
then moved back to Mexico where the

149
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,279
native people of Mexico domesticated the

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,759
large fruited tomato that we all

151
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,758
recognize

152
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,959
today. So there we don't really have um

153
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,560
records of what you know early tomatoes

154
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:20,879
selected in Mexico look like in terms of

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,879
herbarium specimens or images. Um what

156
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,560
we do have is what was characterized by

157
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,959
the Europeans in the middle of the 1500s

158
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,280
um shortly after the conquest of Mexico

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,799
and when when the tomato and other crops

160
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,679
were moved back to Europe and grown in

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,439
botanical gardens and characterized by

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,639
um

163
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,160
botonists. And what what we can see is

164
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,439
that there really was quite a bit of

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
morphological variety. You know,

166
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,519
tomatoes at this point were yellow, they

167
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,519
were red, they may have been purple,

168
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,519
they they were different shapes, they

169
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,478
were small, they were large. Um, it

170
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,879
seems like native Mexican farmers

171
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,639
probably selected and grew and preserved

172
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,279
a diversity of varieties with with with

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
different uh

174
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,038
morphologies. So, shortly after that,

175
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,079
the tomato began to spread outside of

176
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,918
botanical gardens and into local

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,839
cuisines and cultures across Europe,

178
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,159
starting in Spain and Italy and then

179
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,959
moving to other countries. And as this

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,000
new crop was integrated into new

181
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,000
cultures um we saw this radiation of

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,478
morphological diversity and development

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,560
of uh novel use types. So in Italy you

184
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,918
see the development of types that some

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
of you might be familiar with today like

186
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,560
the San Marzano paste tomato a type with

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,439
high soluble solids for processing into

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,199
sauces. In Spain, there was a

189
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,000
development of these um uh storage

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,000
tomatoes, these de penhar varieties that

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,560
traditionally were hung and stored for

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
the winter.

193
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,199
Um, and what's kind of interesting or uh

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,240
paradoxical is that despite all of this

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,240
morphological variation, genetic data

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,478
shows that actually these vintage or

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,280
traditional European land races of

198
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,159
tomato have a very narrow genetic basis.

199
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,119
uh much more narrow than the the wild

200
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,439
populations that that preceded

201
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,000
them. And it seems hard to believe, but

202
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,439
if if you um are familiar with some of

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,959
the effects of some of the mutations

204
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,360
that are used in tomato breeding, it

205
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,680
kind of starts to make sense. So, uh

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160
this figure on the right here shows just

207
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,319
the effects of four different genes with

208
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,520
strong effects on tomato fruit shape

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,639
variation. And you can see how different

210
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,519
combinations of alals at these four

211
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,278
lossi result in this wide variation of

212
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,080
tomato shapes among modern market

213
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,080
classes of of tomato.

214
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,360
So thinking about genetic diversity in

215
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:51,278
tomatoes evolutionary history

216
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,039
um it appears that there were multiple

217
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,278
incidences of genetic bottlenecks

218
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,439
affecting the genetic diversity but also

219
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,200
a few cases where as a result of ad

220
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,600
mixture and crossing with wild relatives

221
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
the genetic diversity

222
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,560
increased. So first as pimpanellopolium

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,879
migrated to Mexico um there was a a

224
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,719
reduction in genetic diversity but then

225
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,958
as those populations moved back to South

226
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,200
America crossed with the wild population

227
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,479
the pipelium there was an increase in

228
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,800
genetic diversity after domestication in

229
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Mexico to the large fruited domesticated

230
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,719
type that we're familiar with. there was

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
a further reduction in genetic diversity

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,560
that was made more extreme with the

233
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,519
bottleneck as those moved out of the

234
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,919
Americas and into Europe. But actually,

235
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
if you look at the genetic diversity in

236
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,719
modern varieties today, um there's

237
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,200
actually been an increase in genetic

238
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
diversity in modern tomato varieties,

239
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
which is, you know, kind of contradicts

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,519
something that a lot of us think when we

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,160
think about the results of of modern

242
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,679
plant

243
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,679
breeding. And the reason for that is

244
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,399
because um plantreeders have

245
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:59,519
intentionally introgressed

246
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,480
uh alals from wild species into modern

247
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,639
tomato varieties uh as sources of

248
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,399
important agonomic traits. So here I'm

249
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,720
showing the fogyny of tomato species

250
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,679
that I showed earlier. Those species

251
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,600
that I've circled here um have been used

252
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,120
to identify traits of interest, move

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
them into tomatoes, and those traits are

254
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,039
used commercially today in tomato

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,519
breeding. And it's not just the most

256
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,199
closely related relative to panelium.

257
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
It's some that are quite quite diverged

258
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,720
from domesticated tomato. The species

259
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,240
that I put an asterisk next to, there's

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,639
reports in the literature about um QTL

261
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,079
or genes being mapped and moved to

262
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,838
tomato, but I'm not sure if they're

263
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,759
they're used commercially or not.

264
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,800
So sequencing data shows that these wild

265
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,039
introgressions actually contribute

266
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,958
significantly to the genomes of modern

267
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,120
varieties. So if you look at these

268
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,518
images here, the the the light blue

269
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,159
represents hletypes from modern tomatoes

270
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,078
and these other colors show hletypes in

271
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,319
wild species and the traits that they're

272
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,239
associated with. So in some cases if you

273
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
look at chromosome 1 and you look at

274
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
these processing tomato hybrids here

275
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,679
denoted with P you can see that they're

276
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
small in progressions from selenium of

277
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,239
habricites that provide higher soluble

278
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,440
solids content associated with the AGPL1

279
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,759
gene. But if you look at chromosome six,

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
you can see among a variety of modern

281
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,278
varieties, both fresh market and

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
processing, you'll see that over half of

283
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,039
the chromosome seems to be represented

284
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
by these two different disease

285
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,759
resistance in regressions from selenium

286
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,759
chilenc and selenium peranum. And then

287
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,159
that's even more extreme on chromosome 9

288
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,759
with tomato where essentially all of the

289
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,319
fresh market hybrids that were sequenced

290
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,120
in the study um have a very large

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,800
introgression from senamanum conferring

292
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,799
resistance to tomato mosaic

293
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,120
virus. It's even more amazing to think

294
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,719
about this when you think about or see

295
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,560
in seed cataloges the extent of

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,519
introgressions that are present in

297
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,518
modern tomato varieties. So here's a

298
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
screenshot I took uh from the Harris

299
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,679
seed catalog. This is a tomato called

300
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,600
Maverick bred by um an an alumnist of

301
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,679
Cornell, Jason Cavort with earthwork

302
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,519
seed. And if you look at what I

303
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,319
highlighted in terms of its disease

304
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,560
resistance package, we can count one two

305
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,879
three four five six seven eight nine 10

306
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,679
11 resistance to 12 different disease

307
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,200
diseases or disease races. A few of

308
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,278
these might be represented by different

309
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,879
multiple genes and all of those are

310
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,039
independent integrations from wild

311
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,519
species that tomato breeders have have

312
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,519
used in

313
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:43,199
breeding. So before I go into the focus

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
of my lab and talk about a few examples

315
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
of how we're using genetic diversity in

316
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,399
tomato breeding, I thought it might be

317
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
useful to just give an overview of kind

318
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
of what the tomato industry looks like

319
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,639
in the United States and where the

320
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,959
tomatoes that we eat come from.

321
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,799
So in terms of acreage, the state with

322
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,039
the most significant acreage is

323
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,319
California with almost 300,000 acres of

324
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,838
tomato and this is predominantly um

325
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
processing tomatoes. So this is a very

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
highly specialized industry with

327
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,839
specialized varieties

328
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,160
um that are machine harvested and these

329
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,320
are processed into ketchup and tomato

330
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,559
sauces and all other products that that

331
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
we

332
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,480
eat. The state with the second highest

333
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,240
proport uh amount of tomato acreage is

334
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Florida. There are about 30,000 acres of

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,079
tomato in Florida. Um historically

336
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
Florida is where um the tomatoes that we

337
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,120
were shipped across the country and

338
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
consumed in in the offseason when

339
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,879
tomatoes couldn't be grown elsewhere

340
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,360
were were produced. And historically the

341
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,679
way this happened was um these were

342
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
varieties that were picked when they

343
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,719
were uh what's called mature green. So

344
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,278
before they start turning red um off the

345
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,519
plant they were exposed to ethylene gas

346
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,799
to promote ripening and this way they

347
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,480
could maintain a very high level of

348
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,319
firmness and tolerate being shipped

349
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,278
around the country and that industry

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,278
still still continues

351
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,799
today. Increasingly though if you go to

352
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,159
the supermarket and look at tomatoes

353
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,399
that are there and look at the sticker

354
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,838
and see where they came from um you

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
might notice that a lot of them come

356
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,760
from Canada. Um, and these are varieties

357
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,079
coming from high-tech green houses. Um,

358
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,639
these green houses, there's a there's a

359
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,919
large number of them in in Ontario. Um,

360
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,919
also many in the northeast and

361
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,278
Midwestern United States. And this is

362
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,759
another very highly specialized

363
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,600
production system where uh these green

364
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,519
houses grow indeterminant or vining

365
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
types. They're plants that are grown for

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
for 10 or even more months. Um, by the

367
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,000
end of the season, these things are

368
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
dozens of feet long. And these are

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,078
producing, you know, high quality tomato

370
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,760
varieties that are sold often, you know,

371
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,759
retail in supermarkets in in

372
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,919
clamshells. Finally, the la the last

373
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,159
major kind of production zone I'll

374
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,838
mention is Mexico. We we import a lot of

375
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,919
tomatoes from Mexico. Um, unlike

376
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
Florida, these are typically harvested

377
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,879
viner ripe. Many of these varieties have

378
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,799
a gene that offers extended shelf life.

379
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,958
Um, so they have slow ripening and they

380
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,000
can tolerate being shipped um when

381
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,838
they're ripe and you'll see a lot of

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
these in the supermarket as

383
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,600
well. So the the I would say those are

384
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
the four major production regions and um

385
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
what I didn't mention was was New York

386
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,799
in the northeastern United States. Um

387
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,599
and that's that's obviously where we are

388
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,599
and that's where my work is based. So in

389
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
New York, we we have around 2,000 or

390
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
maybe a little, you know, a little bit

391
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,159
more acres of tomatoes grown in the open

392
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
field. There's probably similar acorage

393
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,319
in Pennsylvania and New England. Um so

394
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,039
compared to say Florida or California or

395
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,680
Mexico or high-tech green houses, the

396
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,679
total value of that seed market is is

397
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,159
more minor, right? So in terms of

398
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,479
private sector investment and breeding,

399
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,278
there's a uh you know fewer resources

400
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,800
devoted to breeding for for this region,

401
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,799
but it's still a significant amount of

402
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,319
acreage. And because farms on average in

403
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,240
the Northeast are smaller than many

404
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
other parts of the country, um

405
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
collectively, you know, this this is

406
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,679
representing thousands of individual

407
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,039
vegetable farms, uh for many of these

408
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,399
people, tomato might be a very

409
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,000
significant crop in terms of their

410
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,440
profit margins, and there's still many

411
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,440
needs that need to be addressed for this

412
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,440
area.

413
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,399
So, you know, what what are those

414
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,360
needs? Things that I would say would

415
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,799
would define tomato production where

416
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,399
where we are is, you know, we have a

417
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,319
pretty short growing season, May to

418
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,240
September. Uh we have warm, humid

419
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,800
summers that result in high fungal and

420
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,198
bacterial disease pressure. And those

421
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,078
diseases that we have in the Northeast

422
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,758
are um in many cases different than the

423
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,519
diseases that are of importance in the

424
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,120
Southeast. and in protected culture

425
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,198
environments. Um, in the Northeast, we

426
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,399
also have very high proximity to major

427
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,240
population centers. Um, people with very

428
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
high demand for for good quality

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
produce. And that results in farms

430
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
having a diversity of marketing

431
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,120
strategies, people selling wholesale and

432
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
people selling directly to consumers

433
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,000
through things like farmers markets and

434
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,000
community supported agriculture.

435
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
So in terms of my lab's research and

436
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,759
extension goals to to summarize it at a

437
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,919
really high level what we do is we try

438
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,519
to release cultivars and germ plasm

439
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
adapted to the northeastern United

440
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,879
States with high yield quality and

441
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:32,839
disease resistance. We discover the

442
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,039
genetic basis of traits of agonomic

443
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,480
or in many cases traits that are

444
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,798
important to the northeast but also to

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,558
other production regions. Another goal

446
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,240
we have is to model strategies for the

447
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,240
implementation of new technologies and

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,839
applied vegetable breeding. And then as

449
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,599
part of our extension mission, we we try

450
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,759
to generate and disseminate results on

451
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,439
variety performance in New York for our

452
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,679
stakeholders, which which are farmers,

453
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,720
gardeners, and members of the seed

454
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,240
industry. So I'm now going to get into

455
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
two different projects that we're

456
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
working on um leveraging genetic

457
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,639
diversity from tomatoes past at at kind

458
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
of different places in in its

459
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,759
evolutionary history. So for the first

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,759
project, we're accessing diversity that

461
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,000
diverged from tomato millions of years

462
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,759
ago. And this is from uh the species of

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,759
lambsidians where we're looking at

464
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,200
sources of abiotic stress

465
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,319
tolerance. And then you know instead of

466
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,919
millions of years ago, we're also

467
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,918
accessing diversity that diverged from

468
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,320
modern tomato maybe more like a hundred

469
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
years ago or 150 years ago. So this this

470
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,918
figure is definitely not to scale and

471
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,440
and that's quality that we're trying to

472
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,320
access from heirloom varieties for

473
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,519
modern tomato breeding.

474
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:42,240
So I'll talk a little bit first about

475
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:45,519
seleniums. Selenomsidians is a tomato

476
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,400
wild relative that grows in the Ottakama

477
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,879
desert of northern Chile. This the

478
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Otakama desert is the most arid

479
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,000
non-polar desert on Earth. Um on average

480
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
it receives about half an inch of

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,558
rainfall a year and some weather

482
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,880
stations in the Otakama desert have

483
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,119
never recorded any precipitation as long

484
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,840
as they've been there. Um, but what's

485
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,159
remarkable is if you look at these

486
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,079
pretty desolate landscapes, there are

487
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,320
these wild tomatoes that are able to

488
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,319
grow there. So, it seems like pretty

489
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,159
remarkable source of of tolerance to

490
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,839
these very harsh

491
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,360
conditions. If if you look at the fogyny

492
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,079
that I showed earlier, you'll notice

493
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,678
that I didn't have a a circle around

494
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,759
seleniums.

495
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,679
That's because for a long time um

496
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,079
breeders weren't able to access genetic

497
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,440
diversity in salamsidians because of

498
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,720
reproductive barriers with like a

499
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,640
personum. You can't cross like a

500
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,200
persicum and salamsidians.

501
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,400
However, uh Roger Shadlay at the

502
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,480
University of California, Davis, um over

503
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,160
the course of many years, decades

504
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,558
actually, um completed a very complex

505
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,440
series of crosses using bridge species

506
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,519
in order to move genetic material from

507
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
cyians into like a persicum and

508
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,160
developed a population of introgression

509
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,678
lines. Uh these are 56 lines. Each of

510
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,960
them have a single introgression from

511
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,120
selenium cidians in the background of

512
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,919
domesticated fresh market tomato. Um

513
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,239
these inressions range in size but on

514
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
average they're about 20 megabases which

515
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,160
you know most of them probably have

516
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,559
several hundred genes. Um and this

517
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,679
population was developed and released

518
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,158
recently for um use by the tomato

519
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,440
breeding

520
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,280
community. So we were very interested in

521
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,558
this when I when I first started and we

522
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,240
still are. Um there are multiple traits

523
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,158
that you know we're interested in

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,200
looking at. One of them is salindy

525
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,559
stress.

526
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,038
Um and there's there's a there's a few

527
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,200
different reasons why. So cindy stress

528
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,200
can depress tomato yield in a few

529
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
different environments of commercial

530
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
relevance. So, in the central valley of

531
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,440
California, where, like I said earlier,

532
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,759
you know, there's almost 300,000 acres

533
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,759
of tomato, there are actually millions

534
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,440
of acres of crop land there that are

535
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:08,480
affected by pretty high groundwater

536
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,240
sali. Um, this this red area shows um

537
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,919
areas where the salia is so high that

538
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,720
there's a yield impact on

539
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,799
tomato. In New York, you know, we're a

540
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,519
much wetter climate. sal so soil

541
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,400
salinization is not really so much of an

542
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,240
issue. Um but actually in certain kind

543
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,280
of production systems it can be a

544
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,679
problem for farmers. So in in recent

545
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,279
years in the past maybe 10 20 years uh

546
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
the production of tomatoes in high

547
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,158
tunnels has really kind of exploded in

548
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
New York and and many other states. And

549
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
what happens when you put some sort of

550
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,798
covering over your plants and preclude

551
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,600
precipitation from from falling on the

552
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,359
soil is you prevent leeching of salts

553
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,759
that build up through application of

554
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,119
fertilizer and your irrigation water. Um

555
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,119
so this production system actually

556
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,279
results in in in creating something more

557
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,678
similar to like an arid climate as in as

558
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,960
in

559
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,960
California. This can be managed through

560
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,558
cultural practices. But still in recent

561
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,480
years we've seen you know many farmers

562
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:12,000
struggling with uh with high levels of

563
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
soluble salts in their high

564
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,599
tunnels. So there there have been

565
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,559
populations of salamsidians found

566
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,319
growing in in basically like salt basins

567
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,960
soils with an electric conductivity of

568
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,038
almost 100 desins per meter which is

569
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
around 40 times the level that tomato

570
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,119
can tolerate. Um the particular

571
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,798
accession that was used as the parent of

572
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,158
the inggression line population however

573
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,158
hasn't been characterized for its

574
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,320
salinity tolerance. So the first thing

575
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
that we wanted to do was verify that

576
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,439
it's tolerant to salt and also develop

577
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,679
some methods or protocols for evaluating

578
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,200
salinity tolerance. So this work has

579
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,159
been led by um our lab's uh field and

580
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,679
greenhouse manager Howard Rice who uh

581
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,360
has been very creative in designing the

582
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,360
irrigation systems that I'll be showing

583
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,359
and and leading these experiments.

584
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,679
In in the literature, there's many

585
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,038
different ways that salinity is

586
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:13,519
evaluated in tomato. Oftentimes, people

587
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:15,359
evaluate it um in terms of its impact on

588
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,400
vegetative biomass at the seedling

589
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,959
stage. We really wanted to look at fruit

590
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,840
yield, you know, the most like directly

591
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,319
relevant agonomic trait. Um so the way

592
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:30,000
that we did that was we grew plants with

593
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,678
drip irrigation and then in um with

594
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,599
these fertilizer injectors instead of

595
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,840
injecting just fertilizer into those

596
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,399
irrigation systems we injected table

597
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,839
salt as well at different concentrations

598
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
and grew the plants to maturity and

599
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,599
evaluated their yield. I'm just going to

600
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,640
pull my phone out to get a quick time

601
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,639
check. Okay, I think I'm good.

602
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,879
So in this first experiment we looked at

603
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,079
four different um genotypes of tomato

604
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,559
the two parents of this introgression

605
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:06,240
population. So this fresh market line

606
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,839
LA4354 theidians donor here we also as a

607
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,240
susceptible check we looked at a

608
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,599
processing tomato hybrid and as a

609
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,359
resistant check we looked at an

610
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,038
excession of selenopeli that's been

611
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,798
characterized by others for salinity

612
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,599
tolerance. Most of that work though has

613
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,200
been at the seedling level. Um in this

614
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,719
experiment we grew the plants under four

615
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,480
different treatments of fertilizer only

616
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,480
treatment and then three different

617
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,200
levels of um sodium chloride up to a

618
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,278
total electrical connectivity of 17.5

619
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
descendants per meter which is much

620
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,480
higher than what you would you know any

621
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,640
farmer would hope to find in their in

622
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,640
their soil.

623
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,918
So here I'm showing the effects on fruit

624
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,839
yield for the two tomato entries in this

625
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,559
experiment. Um if you look at the red

626
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,558
that's denoting the fresh market parent

627
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,720
of the integration line population. The

628
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,720
green is the processing tomato hybrid.

629
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
You can see on the left here pretty

630
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,679
steep decline in yield with increasing

631
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,798
salt

632
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,640
concentration. The under the highest

633
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,480
level of salt that we applied the yield

634
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
was maybe around 20% of what we saw

635
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
under the control. You can also see that

636
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
the most precipitous decline was from

637
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,559
the control to the first level of

638
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,240
salinity applied and after that it kind

639
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,519
of

640
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,480
plateaued. Um something that's

641
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,079
interesting that we haven't really

642
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,200
followed up on but um you know seemed to

643
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,399
be a curious result was although the

644
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,798
response with these two different

645
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,200
varieties was the same in their total

646
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,720
yield the way that that was realized was

647
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,319
different actually. So, Selenium uh the

648
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,200
the fresh market tomato variety showed a

649
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:43,278
decrease in fruit weight whereas the

650
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,558
processing tomato hybrid showed a

651
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,319
decrease in fruit number. Um but but

652
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,440
they that resulted in in the same

653
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,439
response in terms of total yield.

654
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,278
So for the two wild species we had in

655
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,679
this experiment, we we can't evaluate

656
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,440
their fruit yield because they devote a

657
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
really negligible portion of their

658
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,278
biomass to fruit. So the way that we

659
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,600
looked at this was we looked at their

660
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,359
vegetative

661
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,959
biomass. Um and the results of this were

662
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,119
kind of surprising to us. So if you look

663
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,558
at again at the at the domesticated

664
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:19,119
tomato genotypes in this experiment

665
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:20,720
represented in orange and green you can

666
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,239
see that there wasn't really a strong

667
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
response to celindia in terms of their

668
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,120
vegetative biomass. In fact under two of

669
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,918
the salt dosages the fresh market tomato

670
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:35,599
lime showed greater vegetative biomass

671
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,759
and under the control. Um the two

672
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,158
presumably resistant wild species

673
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,640
actually showed stronger declines in

674
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,240
vegetative biomass. Um if you look at

675
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,520
cyians which is this teal color here um

676
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,919
you can see the difference from the

677
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,240
control to the highest salt

678
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,400
concentration there. In terms of the

679
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
absolute difference it was fairly minor

680
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,640
but that's because salamines we found to

681
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,558
be a slow growing plant. There wasn't

682
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,600
really much biomass to to to decrease.

683
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,200
Um but as a relative difference actually

684
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,719
it had the steepest decline of all four

685
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,840
of the entries in this experiment. Um so

686
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
that that was kind of like a

687
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,278
disappointing result, right? You don't

688
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,080
want the the donor of the trait that

689
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,119
you're hoping to introgress to show a

690
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,839
poorer response than than the uh than

691
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,879
the pair you're hoping to introgress it

692
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,720
into. But after thinking about a little

693
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
bit more, you know, maybe we decided

694
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
maybe it's comparing apples to oranges,

695
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,120
right? We're comparing these species who

696
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,880
don't produce any fruit. They don't

697
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,079
devote any energy to fruit production

698
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,039
and comparing their vegetative biomass

699
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,558
to tomato varieties that do devote a lot

700
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,480
of energy to fruit production and we saw

701
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,158
that that fruit production was affected.

702
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,200
So we we move forward with screening the

703
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,200
integration lines thinking that uh maybe

704
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,720
in the background of domesticated tomato

705
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,840
we'd be able to see more of the effects

706
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,839
of the salamidians

707
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,918
genome. So we started by looking at 27

708
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,079
inression lines. Um not all of the

709
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,360
complete set um was available for

710
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,759
dissemination when we started this

711
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,119
experiment. We also avoided lines

712
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,278
carrying introgressions in a

713
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,079
hetererozygous condition. These are

714
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,480
introgressions where there's um a

715
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,398
recessive lethal mutation in the

716
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,759
background of domesticated tomato. And

717
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,398
to make our lives easier, we just

718
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,640
avoided working with

719
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:29,038
those. We evaluated these under both

720
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,440
control conditions and a fertilizer

721
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:36,000
treatment with about 75 uh millar um

722
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,038
sodium chloride. We completed the first

723
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,880
replicate of this um last fall and the

724
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,000
second replicate is is we're hoping to

725
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
wrap up in the next month or

726
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:50,558
so. And here, you know, as as opposed to

727
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,480
looking at the wild species itself, here

728
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,960
we were able to see an effect of

729
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,519
salinity tolerance when you look at at

730
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,720
the um gene effects in the background of

731
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,240
domesticated tomato. So in this plot

732
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
here on the left I'm showing the

733
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,720
distribution of fruit yield under the

734
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,120
control. On the right is the

735
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,200
distribution of fruit yield under the

736
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,439
salt treatment. There's lines connecting

737
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,679
the performance of individual genotypes

738
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,480
between those two treatments. The red

739
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,000
line is is the domesticated parent

740
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
recurrent parent of the population and

741
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,839
the black lines are all introgression

742
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,240
lines.

743
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:28,639
Um, we saw unsurprisingly that the

744
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,399
domesticated parent did pretty well for

745
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,559
yield. Under control conditions, it

746
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,239
ranked fifth, but under saline

747
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,319
conditions, it ranked 17th in terms of

748
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
its yield. And then in terms of the

749
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,759
severity of its percent decline in

750
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,080
yield, um, it ranked third. So out of

751
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,558
out of all the entries, um, it showed

752
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,599
the third steepest response in terms of

753
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:52,879
its its difference uh, in in sailing

754
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:56,000
versus control conditions.

755
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,480
The introgression lines ranged from a

756
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,798
response of about a decline similar to

757
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,798
the domesticated parent around 80%. Uh

758
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,440
and the best integration lines showed a

759
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,960
decline in yield around

760
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,200
45%. Um we also saw there were four

761
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,278
integration lines that out outy yielded

762
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,360
the domesticated parent under both

763
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,398
control and salt

764
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,079
conditions. So what what are our

765
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,119
immediate takeaways from this

766
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,639
experiment? Well, for one thing, you

767
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,239
know, by the fact that almost all the

768
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,159
introgression lines did better than the

769
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,240
recurrent parent, it seems like there

770
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,880
are multiple genes distributed across

771
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,079
the genome that provide partial effects

772
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,640
individually on salt tolerance. My

773
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,599
background is is in disease resistance

774
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,880
breeding and pathology, right? Where um

775
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:46,719
we can identify single genes, R genes

776
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,000
with major effects. And um I probably

777
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,519
should have done my homework and read

778
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,558
some more about plant physiology. This

779
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,119
this might not have been such a

780
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,359
surprising uh find in terms of abiotic

781
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,359
stress

782
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,278
resistance. So this leads to the

783
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,919
question are these genes

784
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,759
um do they have effects that are large

785
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,919
enough to be commercially relevant?

786
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,079
Right? We can look at the lines that did

787
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,159
the best. Right? They had a 45% decline

788
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,158
in yield compared to an 80% for the

789
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,399
domesticated tomato. And you you can

790
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,360
look at that two ways, right? One is 45%

791
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,359
is much better than 80%. But also a 45%

792
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,719
decline in yield is still a 45% decline

793
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,519
in yield, right? Is that is that enough

794
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,480
to to be relevant

795
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,839
commercially? So we need to do further

796
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,200
experiments to figure that out. One

797
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,959
thing that we're interested in doing is

798
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,440
combining different integrations that

799
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,038
each had pretty, you know, good effects

800
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
individually and seeing what they look

801
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,839
like in combination. We're currently

802
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,679
doing a crossing block to to try to

803
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,759
answer that. And then another question

804
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,440
that we need to answer is um can we

805
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,759
reduce the sizes of these introgressions

806
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,640
enough to get rid of linkage drag while

807
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,839
retain the effects on salt tolerance. Um

808
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,080
so there's a lot of work to do, but

809
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,439
we're excited about this project. Um I

810
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,960
mean just just looking at the fruit

811
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,038
yields from

812
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,120
um the control on the left to salt on

813
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,798
the right. Um except the the patterns

814
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,719
actually reversed this lower picture. I

815
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,798
don't want to mislead anybody.

816
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,038
um you can see the the variation in

817
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,558
response along these lines and visually

818
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,480
it's it's pretty observable the impact

819
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,000
that that these integrations

820
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,159
have. We're also moving on to look at

821
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,960
other traits that we're interested in.

822
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,080
Um one of these is freezing tolerance.

823
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Um the accession of slamsidians that was

824
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,480
used as the parent of this population um

825
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,919
was characterized and discovered growing

826
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,798
at really high elevations where the

827
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,559
temperature goes below 0 degrees. Um

828
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:40,798
Pablo Benort is an intern in my lab

829
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,079
who's leading this work and we've been

830
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,558
really excited to see that when you

831
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,000
throw tomatoes in a growth chamber at

832
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:50,000
pretty cold temperatures um they come

833
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,519
out looking like this but when you throw

834
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,798
salamidians in there it comes out

835
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,759
looking like that. Um, it seems like

836
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,440
maybe a more far-fetched uh project than

837
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:04,158
even the the the salinity tolerance

838
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,480
project, but what we hope is that we can

839
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,200
develop tomato varieties that have

840
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,798
freezing tolerance as seedlings. farmers

841
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,159
can transplant them to their fields

842
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,440
maybe a few weeks earlier than they

843
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,960
typically would um get season extension,

844
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
maybe harvest tomatoes earlier in the

845
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
season when prices are are are prefer

846
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,759
are are better um and not have to worry

847
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,759
about late spring frosts. So Pablo just

848
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,960
this week I think wrapped up screening

849
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,240
the rest of the integration line

850
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
population. So if you're interested in

851
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,319
the results of this project, come talk

852
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,319
to him during this uh event today.

853
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
Okay. So I want to move on and talk

854
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,679
about another project that we're doing

855
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,840
uh focused on using heirloom tomato

856
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,360
varieties in breeding. Um so I I want to

857
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,359
give a little bit of a historical

858
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,079
perspective.

859
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,119
So in terms of modern tomato breeding,

860
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,759
so breeding trends in the 20th century,

861
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,638
um what those trends reflect are kind of

862
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,519
larger ongoing trends in society at the

863
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,800
time, right? um industrialization of

864
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,800
agriculture, the commodification of

865
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,440
produce, and that's reflected in the

866
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,599
traits that breeders were selecting on

867
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,039
things like

868
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,440
uniformity, firmness, fruit firmness,

869
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:27,440
and chipability, fruit size, shape, and

870
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,200
color, disease resistance, yield. Um, I

871
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,240
don't have on their flavor. It probably

872
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,480
was not a major trait under selection

873
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,479
for for a lot of this modern tomato

874
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,480
breeding.

875
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,159
Towards the end of of the 20th century,

876
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,760
so starting maybe in the late 1980s or

877
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
1990s,

878
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,320
um the heirloom tomato started kind of

879
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,200
growing in in popularity. If you look at

880
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,919
this figure on the left, this is showing

881
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,358
the mentions of of the term heirloom

882
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,480
tomato in two newspapers from 1989 to

883
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,679
2005. And you can see that, you know, it

884
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,039
at one point it was something that

885
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,000
didn't really exist in our popular

886
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,519
consciousness. and within a few decades

887
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,679
became something that was common to talk

888
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,480
about. Um, and that was the result of

889
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,559
maybe a few different larger movements

890
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
or trends happening in society that kind

891
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,320
of represented maybe a push back against

892
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,599
some of the industrialization of

893
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,160
agriculture that was happening at the

894
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,559
time. So, the seeds exchange was

895
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:30,159
established in 1975. That's a network of

896
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,480
individuals interested in preserving

897
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,039
seed that maybe was handed down to them

898
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,199
in their family or or uh in their

899
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,639
community. um saving those varieties and

900
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,879
distributing them among a network of

901
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,920
other seed

902
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,559
savers. Chefs like Alice Waters um

903
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,280
opened restaurants that were the first

904
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,838
to champion what we now refer to as

905
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,960
farm-totable cooking. They included

906
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,480
items on their menus like heirloom

907
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,240
tomatoes. And you know, pretty soon

908
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,480
heirloom tomatoes became ubiquitous at

909
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,159
farmers markets, upscale restaurants,

910
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,079
and today they're pretty common to find

911
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,440
in grocery stores at Wegmans here in

912
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:11,440
Ithaca. I can see them uh all year round

913
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
uh grown in in green houses in in

914
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:17,039
Canada. So what what what exactly is an

915
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,559
heirloom tomato? And the the answer is

916
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,960
you know we we don't really know. There

917
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,960
there's there's no scientific definition

918
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,720
for this term heirloom tomato. But there

919
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,679
are a few different definitions that are

920
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,719
thrown um around you know uh more

921
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:33,639
popularly. So here here are some of the

922
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,838
most common ones. They must be open

923
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,759
pollinated. They must have been

924
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,759
introduced more than 50 years ago.

925
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,440
That's kind of an arbitrary cutoff, but

926
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,200
you know what it means is that these

927
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,838
aren't the results of modern breeding,

928
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,159
right? These are uh heritage varieties

929
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,159
that that were selected in a previous

930
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,159
time. And then according to this book,

931
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,559
Taylor's Guide to Heirloom vegetables,

932
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,920
they must have a history of their own.

933
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:00,480
Um, and many of these varieties are

934
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,720
accompanied by stories like familiar

935
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
lore about where these came from, who

936
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,639
originally selected them, how many

937
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,919
generations they were passed down, um,

938
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,920
that make them kind of more more

939
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,920
interesting.

940
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,800
I think if you do ask most people what

941
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,880
an heirloom tomato is, uh maybe I'll,

942
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,200
you know, I'll pull all of you later. I

943
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
think they probably wouldn't refer to to

944
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,519
these things. Instead, they'd probably

945
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,960
be thinking of um visual traits, right?

946
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,119
Things that differentiate them from

947
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,480
round red tomatoes, differences in size,

948
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,480
shape, and color. maybe some defects

949
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,679
that have been selected against defects,

950
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,000
you know, depending on uh who who who's

951
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,319
deciding what a defect is. Things like

952
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,679
green shoulders or scarring on the

953
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,640
blossom end of the fruit that are all

954
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,078
associated with these

955
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,920
varieties. So the these are these are a

956
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,680
few of my personal favorite heirloom

957
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,760
varieties. These are also ones that are

958
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,598
among the most popular and most

959
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,760
wellknown. um Cherokee purple, uh brandy

960
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,160
wine, both pink brandy wine and yellow

961
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,599
brandy wine, striped German.

962
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,679
Um if you've grown these in in your

963
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,119
garden, maybe you'll agree with me that

964
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,199
these are very delicious varieties of

965
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
tomatoes. They're they're beautiful. Um

966
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,319
and their quality in terms of eating

967
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,719
them fresh in a salad is really

968
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
excellent. So I think you know part of

969
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,159
the popularity of heirloom tomatoes is

970
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,800
not only for their cultural associations

971
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:34,319
and and you know their repres what they

972
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,839
mean in terms of um self-sufficiency and

973
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,680
seed saving and a push back against

974
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,119
industrialization of agriculture but

975
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,078
also for their value in and of

976
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,079
themselves as as really excellent um

977
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,079
varieties.

978
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
So, in recent years, there's been kind

979
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,800
of a movement with some seed companies

980
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,079
to develop varieties combining some of

981
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,680
these qualities found in heirloom

982
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,359
tomatoes with traits more typical of

983
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,679
modern hybrids. So, things like disease

984
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,078
resistance, resistance to cracking, high

985
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,879
yield potential. This is a screenshot

986
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,920
from high mowing seed catalog. And one

987
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,358
of the terms that some of these

988
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,800
companies um is using is is high looms.

989
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,639
A combination of hybrid and heirlooms.

990
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,920
Uh we like that term a lot and that's a

991
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,440
term that we're using in our lab to

992
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,960
describe the the breeding efforts that

993
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,920
that we are

994
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,960
using. One thing that we started doing

995
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,720
in the lab was uh variety trials of

996
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,760
commercial high varieties. Here you you

997
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,358
can see uh the harvest from these

998
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,079
varieties uh in bins in preparation for

999
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,400
a field day we had last summer. You can

1000
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,720
see the variation in in color, how

1001
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,160
beautiful some of these varieties are.

1002
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,519
In terms of the data that we collected,

1003
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,358
we also saw that there have been, you

1004
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,159
know, pretty significant improvements in

1005
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,319
terms of many agonomic traits. So this

1006
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,319
plot on the right is showing these

1007
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
varieties in terms of their percent

1008
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,240
grade one fruit. So the proportion of

1009
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,199
fruit that can be marketed as USDA grade

1010
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,479
one, meaning free of blemishes and other

1011
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:05,039
defects. If you look at Brandy Wine

1012
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,599
Pink, which is our heirloom check, the

1013
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,719
percent grade one was about 25%. Which,

1014
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,720
you know, if you think about that from a

1015
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,319
commercial agriculture perspective,

1016
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,439
that's that's pretty pretty pretty bad.

1017
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,160
If a farmer has to uh discount or throw

1018
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,000
away 75% of the harvest, but these

1019
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,759
Highland varieties, you know, get get up

1020
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,320
to uh 70 70%. So pretty big improvement.

1021
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,800
We also trial just normal standard

1022
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,160
slicer tomatoes. Uh we found in our

1023
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
trials that the percent grade one on

1024
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,920
those can get up to say like 95%. So

1025
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
there's there's still probably our

1026
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,880
trade-offs in terms of things like

1027
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,240
resistance to fruit defects,

1028
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,280
shipability, and traits relating to

1029
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:47,719
eating quality, softness, texture, uh

1030
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,720
thickness of fruit skin, etc.

1031
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,838
So, another thing that we did when I

1032
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:57,598
first started in in um 2023 was um

1033
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,920
surveyed growers in New York about their

1034
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,920
perceptions of both heirloom and highle

1035
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,280
tomatoes. Uh this was in collaboration

1036
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,240
with Teresa Rousnik um vegetable

1037
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,160
specialist with Cornell Cooperative

1038
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,199
Extension. And out of the 76 tomato

1039
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,399
growers in New York who responded to our

1040
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,078
questionnaire, uh we found that about

1041
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,200
threequarters of them grew heirloom

1042
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,400
varieties as a portion of their

1043
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,199
production. So that kind of speaks to

1044
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,318
the demand that that that's that's um

1045
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:27,439
grown for for for this type of product.

1046
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:30,000
Uh fewer grew high varieties. About 44%

1047
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,440
grew high varieties. And when we asked

1048
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,440
what the challenges that they found

1049
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,720
associated with heirlooms, uh there were

1050
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,318
things that we weren't surprised by. you

1051
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,559
know disease susceptibility,

1052
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,440
susceptibility to fruit defects and poor

1053
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,199
storeability or shipability. Uh what I

1054
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,440
found more interesting was when we asked

1055
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,759
what are your desired attributes in

1056
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,760
terms of future highland varieties. And

1057
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,359
when they ranked these the top four were

1058
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,920
number one uh resistance to diseases

1059
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,559
common of the open field, number two

1060
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,358
resistance to fruit defects, three

1061
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,880
determinant growth habit and four uh

1062
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,719
resistance to diseases more common in

1063
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,559
the high tunnel. And the reason that

1064
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,239
this is interesting to me is that most

1065
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,078
of the seed companies currently are

1066
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,759
breeding types that are indeterminate

1067
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,560
and maybe more adapted to the high

1068
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,560
tunnel or the greenhouse in terms of uh

1069
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,920
their disease resistance package. So it

1070
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:23,519
seemed like there were some needs that

1071
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,599
that still um may be left um needing to

1072
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,599
be

1073
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,440
addressed. So we we started um crossing

1074
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,560
modern varieties with with heirloom

1075
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,838
varieties in 2023. Um, in terms of the

1076
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,759
modern lines that we're using as

1077
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:41,920
parents, we're we're making uh use of

1078
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,319
lines developed at Cornell by my

1079
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
predecessor Martha Mutler, who developed

1080
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,880
lines with a really comprehensive

1081
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,760
disease resistance package to diseases

1082
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,680
uh of the in the open field in the

1083
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,440
northeast. Um, including several novel

1084
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,118
disease resistance genes and QTL that

1085
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,440
her lab discovered. Um, and then we we

1086
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,039
crossed these a few of these lines with

1087
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,960
a number of heirloom varieties. I have

1088
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,880
four listed here. These are the

1089
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,240
populations that we carry forward in the

1090
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,760
in the schema that I'll show you in a

1091
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,919
few slides, but we made crosses with

1092
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,560
with many more. And the objective of

1093
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,639
this work is to develop attractive crack

1094
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:21,679
resistant um high flavor lines with

1095
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,400
strong open field disease resistance and

1096
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,399
determinant

1097
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,240
growth. We've been following a pretty

1098
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,280
aggressive timeline to move this project

1099
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,959
forward. So in the winter 2023 2024 we

1100
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,960
we carried out two generations. We did

1101
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,358
the crossing block. We did the F1

1102
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,880
generation in the greenhouse. The F2 in

1103
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,960
in in the field last year we we used

1104
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,680
marker assisted selection to enrich

1105
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,519
those seedlings for the disease

1106
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,039
resistance alals for especially for the

1107
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,119
diseases that were we were most

1108
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,838
interested in. We then made visual

1109
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,240
selections in the field for uh fruit

1110
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,159
quality traits and for determinant

1111
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:04,159
growth habit. So that's a determinant

1112
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:06,639
growth habit is a concentrated flowering

1113
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,838
type that sets flowers in a short window

1114
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,358
and then kind of stops growing. Um the

1115
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,199
selections from that field here a

1116
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,519
picture of a couple that we're really

1117
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,039
excited about. If we continue to see

1118
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,480
fruit like this, we'll we'll be we'll be

1119
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,480
very pleased. Um and we sent those to uh

1120
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,079
Winter Nursery in Costa Rica for single

1121
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,599
seed descent. So the F4

1122
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,560
generation and this year we we plan to

1123
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,519
get back around 320 F4 families from

1124
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,799
this work. Um these are derived from 10

1125
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,480
crosses. These 320 families not all of

1126
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,400
them are part of this high breeding

1127
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,960
project. Right. We also have crosses

1128
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,639
that are I guess you would say modern

1129
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,159
standard varieties by modern standard

1130
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,879
varieties but six of them are from

1131
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,159
heirloom by modern crosses. And one

1132
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,920
thing that we're excited to do with this

1133
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,118
population is use it as kind of a test

1134
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
case for how we might be able to

1135
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,960
implement genomic selection in our

1136
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,679
tomato program. So this work is being

1137
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,639
led by Jack Frizzio who's a postto in

1138
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,118
the lab. And the specific strategy that

1139
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:08,078
we're planning to use is what people

1140
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,640
call a test and shelf strategy. Um, for

1141
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,680
us, one of the biggest opportunities

1142
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,519
that genomic selection poses to a

1143
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,799
vegetable breeder is the opportunity to

1144
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:21,119
have our phen phenotypic data stretched

1145
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,000
further. Collecting data like yield or

1146
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,160
fruit quality on a perishable crop that

1147
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
has to be picked multiple times is

1148
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,039
really labor intensive. It's very

1149
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,800
difficult for us to do that on a large

1150
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,159
number of entries. But if we can do it

1151
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,560
on a certain number of entries, then

1152
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,920
predict into a larger number, um, we

1153
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,920
think that can have pretty big impact on

1154
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
our breeding program.

1155
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
So this year out of these 320 we're

1156
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,920
going to put 80% of them in the field.

1157
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,359
Um genotype those phenotype them as well

1158
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,440
and then we're going to predict on the

1159
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,880
entire population including the 20% that

1160
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,880
were only genotyping and not

1161
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:58,239
phenotyping. So here's a kind of a quick

1162
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:02,079
schematic of of what that that would

1163
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,239
look like. Um so those 80% will be used

1164
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,440
to calculate genomic estimated breeding

1165
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,598
values including on the hold out set. So

1166
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,599
among that entire population of 320

1167
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,000
we'll select the top 10% across the

1168
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,838
entire population. We'll carry these

1169
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
lines forward for further product

1170
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,039
development you know further testing and

1171
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,280
breeding maybe creating some test

1172
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,000
hybrids. And then we'll also interate

1173
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,880
intermate those um complete another

1174
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,480
cycle of modified single seed descent.

1175
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,000
And then we think that as we continue to

1176
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,559
do this and generate more historical

1177
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,159
data, we can change the proportions,

1178
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,799
right? So maybe in two years when we

1179
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,199
have another population of F4 lines,

1180
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,119
instead of phenotyping 80%, maybe we can

1181
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,879
phenype just 20%. We can include a

1182
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,640
larger population and we can use some of

1183
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,640
the historical data as well to make

1184
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,480
predictions. There there are lots of

1185
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,440
questions to answer on the practical

1186
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,199
implementation of genomic selection. um

1187
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,440
not just in my program but I think

1188
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,118
personally in vegetables in general

1189
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,358
there's there's literature answering

1190
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,800
these questions in many agonomic crops

1191
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,960
that haven't been addressed really in

1192
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,960
many vegetables um so for us you know

1193
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,720
we're really interested in how well can

1194
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,318
we predict within families across

1195
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:15,118
families across market classes are these

1196
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:17,239
high crosses going to be predictive of

1197
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,760
standard tomato by standard tomato

1198
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:21,519
crosses how many markers do we need is

1199
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,200
is a thousand enough a thousand is kind

1200
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:27,119
of the number that that is financially

1201
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,279
reasonable for us. So, we're we're we're

1202
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,800
hoping that's

1203
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,160
enough. What training population sizes

1204
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
are needed to achieve reasonable

1205
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,279
prediction accuracies? Right? Like I

1206
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,880
said, it's a lot of work to collect this

1207
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,079
training data. How much do we really

1208
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,800
need to collect in order for this

1209
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,200
strategy to to work? And then tomato is

1210
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,560
a crop that's primarily marketed as F1

1211
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,799
hybrids. um even if the inburning

1212
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,440
depression is is is not as strong as in

1213
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,680
a crop like corn, we're going to be

1214
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,679
predicting the p per se value of these

1215
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,358
lines. Is that the right strategy?

1216
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,719
Should we instead be predicting general

1217
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,920
combining abilities or specific

1218
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,799
combining abilities? These are things

1219
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,519
that we're hoping to to figure

1220
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,560
out. So, I'm going to start wrapping up

1221
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,679
my my presentation. Um I think you know

1222
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,400
one thing that's kind of in uh in common

1223
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,679
across these two projects that I

1224
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,519
described is the fact that these traits

1225
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,000
that we're interested in are are

1226
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:23,759
quantitative traits. So the the history

1227
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,880
of tomato breeding um there's been uh

1228
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,760
tremendous progress in trait improvement

1229
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,039
focusing on moving qualitative major

1230
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,800
effect genes from wild relatives. in

1231
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,719
terms of using similar approaches to

1232
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,039
improve quantitative traits, it's

1233
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,279
probably going to be a bigger challenge.

1234
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:44,599
Um the way that we're doing that with

1235
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,720
these high loom breeding uh

1236
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:51,119
populations, um we think genomic

1237
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:52,959
selection might help, right? Um we we're

1238
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,318
using breeding methods that we think are

1239
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,480
suitable for the improvement of

1240
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,960
quantitative traits. We don't expect

1241
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,280
necessarily to find amazing varieties in

1242
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,960
that first cycle. We might need a few

1243
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,079
generations of re combination to break

1244
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,039
up linkages between um uh

1245
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,318
alals. But we think that using this

1246
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,558
approach we can we can develop high

1247
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,558
quality lines. In terms of the work

1248
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,280
we're doing with salamsidians where we

1249
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,760
found that there are multiple genes

1250
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,319
conferring resistance to the uh stress

1251
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,319
tolerance that we're interested

1252
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,920
in. the linkage drag is is probably so

1253
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,599
extreme that you know there's only a

1254
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,519
certain limitation in terms of how many

1255
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,318
of the integrations we can practically

1256
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,759
use in commercial breeding right maybe

1257
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,920
there's a world in which we can use two

1258
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,280
of them or even three of them uh if

1259
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,440
we're able to reduce the size of those

1260
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,920
integrations sufficiently but beyond

1261
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,559
that it's probably um not feasible from

1262
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,559
a practical point of view um so I think

1263
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,280
you know there we probably need creative

1264
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,640
solutions moving forward um I don't know

1265
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,200
exactly what those are maybe I'll be

1266
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,960
inspired by the rest of the talks today.

1267
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,159
Um, you know, maybe there's a world in

1268
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,079
which we can use these genetic

1269
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,519
resources, these populations that have

1270
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,240
been developed, the phenotyping

1271
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,639
platforms that we're using to identify

1272
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,318
the genetic basis of these traits, and

1273
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,239
then perhaps instead of actually

1274
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,000
introgressing them into tomato, we can

1275
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,598
just make the edits in tomato through

1276
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,880
genome editing um corresponding to those

1277
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,920
genetic differences that lead to the

1278
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,599
phenotypic

1279
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,720
change. So, with that, I'll I'll wrap

1280
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,318
up. Um I I talked about the work that

1281
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,679
some of my lab members are doing. I

1282
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,679
didn't have the chance to talk about the

1283
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,039
work that my students Ivana Castillo and

1284
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:30,719
Diana Moulder are doing. They're doing

1285
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,719
really exciting projects in disease

1286
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,039
resistance genetics in tomato and

1287
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,039
eggplant. Um, I also want to thank the

1288
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,480
work from former lab members who have

1289
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,880
contributed especially to a lot of the

1290
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,318
field work that we've done and then um

1291
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,400
the funding sources that we've had for

1292
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,480
the projects that I've described

1293
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,240
including the California tomato research

1294
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,358
institute who's funding some of the work

1295
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,318
with seleniums and salt tolerance um

1296
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,480
USDA federal capacity funds Cornell and

1297
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:59,039
the vegetable breeding institute. So, if

1298
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,400
we have time for any questions, I'll I'd

1299
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,000
love to answer them and I also al also

1300
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,920
be around the the rest of the day and I

1301
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,880
look forward to talking with some of you

1302
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,639
then. Thank you.

1303
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,119
Yes. More about your process for voting

1304
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,960
in on your breeding goals and focus for

1305
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,640
this program.

1306
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,639
Sure. That's a that's a that's a very

1307
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,598
good

1308
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,039
question. So, the question was, you

1309
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,680
know, how what what the process was for

1310
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,519
honing in on our our breeding branch.

1311
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,318
Um, I think it's through it was through

1312
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,358
a combination of things and I mean

1313
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:31,239
there, you know, we're still working on

1314
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,400
on them.

1315
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:38,519
Um, the for me the most important thing

1316
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,000
is to be out there and talk to people.

1317
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:43,519
Um, learn what problems are, learn what

1318
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,519
should needs to be addressed, learn what

1319
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,960
solutions already are out there and

1320
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,559
don't need to be reinvented from

1321
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,480
scratch.

1322
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,160
So, you know, my first year, um,

1323
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,159
especially my first summer in my

1324
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,558
position, I tried every week to to

1325
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,399
visit, um, at least one different farm,

1326
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,359
right? Travel to different parts of of

1327
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,280
the state. Um, got in touch with

1328
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,440
extension specialists in those regions,

1329
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,519
got introduced to vegetable growers in

1330
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,200
those areas. Uh, just learned about what

1331
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,559
they did, asked what varieties they

1332
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,519
liked, why they liked them. If, you

1333
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,760
know, if you could have your ideal

1334
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,440
variety, what would it look like? Um,

1335
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,280
and you know, those conversations really

1336
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,720
helped contribute to to a lot of the

1337
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,760
work that we're doing and how we're

1338
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,159
moving forward.

1339
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,720
Uh, yes.

1340
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,239
Hey, thank you. Really cool to see all

1341
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:32,799
the work that you've been doing and I I

1342
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:34,239
love this idea of highs. My question is,

1343
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,318
so you're looking at a lot of the

1344
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,159
agonomic traits, but I'm assuming a lot

1345
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,480
of the motivation of using the heirlooms

1346
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,480
is to introduce some of those more, you

1347
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,559
know, unique flavor and taste profiles,

1348
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,639
but that's of course a really hard thing

1349
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,920
to quantify. Do you have any plans to

1350
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:51,519
incorporate that into your selection?

1351
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,720
That that's a really excellent question.

1352
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,960
The question was, how do we plan to

1353
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:58,318
select for flavor in this high program?

1354
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,800
Um, and you're right that it's really

1355
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,800
tough to select for flavor. In our early

1356
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,559
generation nurseries, we we walk through

1357
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,519
and we do a lot of tasting, but we get

1358
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,960
very sick of tomatoes very quickly. And

1359
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,759
I'm someone who loves tomatoes. I never

1360
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,280
thought that would happen to me. Um, so

1361
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,839
to to start, we're looking at some

1362
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,640
things that are relatively easy to

1363
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:19,679
quantify. Bricks,

1364
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:21,679
acidity. Um, we're going to do some

1365
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,039
taste testing, too. Not formally, but

1366
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,960
informally, and see how well those

1367
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:30,079
traits are associated with our informal

1368
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,079
assessments of flavor. Um, and we're

1369
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,240
going to go from there. I mean, tomato

1370
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,280
flavor has been there's been a lot of

1371
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,679
literature on what what controls our

1372
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,480
perceptions of tomato flavor. And it's a

1373
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,239
mixture

1374
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,159
of sweetness, acidity, and then lots of

1375
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,598
different volatile compounds. And

1376
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,759
measuring those is obviously a lot more

1377
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:53,039
work. So, we're we need to see um how we

1378
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,520
can balance our resources and do that

1379
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,599
efficiently moving

1380
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:59,838
forward. Uh yes, Lance, I got two

1381
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,880
questions. It it always strikes me that

1382
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:05,440
we we've taken this perennial shrub and

1383
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
we kind of impose this annual lifestyle

1384
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,760
onto it, especially for the wild

1385
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,558
relatives. Are we evaluating the the

1386
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,559
traits of these things too early in that

1387
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,240
first season? and and if we gave were

1388
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,079
able to give them time to establish, do

1389
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,759
you think they would be more resistant

1390
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,000
to some of the stressors? The second

1391
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,160
question is given those those big

1392
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,559
integrations and how divergent like

1393
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,480
citians is, Roger probably couldn't

1394
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,240
break those those integressions up with

1395
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,838
with crossover and stuff. So, how do you

1396
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,358
plan to go about breaking these things

1397
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,440
down?

1398
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,440
Okay. Yeah, thanks. Those are those are

1399
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,159
good questions. Yeah. So I think I think

1400
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,800
the first question was you know how do

1401
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:44,960
we evaluate phenotypes and camcidiums

1402
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,039
when it's probably a perennial and its

1403
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,559
growth habit is so different and I think

1404
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,480
the answer is we didn't we probably

1405
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,480
didn't really do a good job of of doing

1406
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,000
that. We we grew it in you know almost

1407
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,159
hydroponically in a greenhouse the way

1408
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,239
we grow normal tomatoes. This is a thing

1409
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,399
that's adapted to the desert, right? um

1410
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,479
we we put in a very different kind of

1411
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,559
artificial condition and probably not

1412
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,599
the best way to assess the traits that

1413
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,599
we were interested in assessing. Um

1414
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,200
however, when you look at the effects of

1415
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,880
portions of the genome of slam obsidians

1416
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,719
in the background of domesticated

1417
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,119
tomato, I think it's much more it's much

1418
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,598
easier to kind of isolate and evaluate

1419
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:22,960
those traits. And your second question

1420
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,039
was how do we plan to break um apart

1421
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,358
those recombinations? and and we don't

1422
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,639
know how easy or difficult it's going to

1423
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,799
be, right? The the the way that we are

1424
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,279
planning to do it now is to just try it

1425
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,880
and see what happens. Um maybe that's

1426
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,880
magical thinking, but I guess I guess

1427
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,680
the only way to to find out is by doing

1428
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,720
it.

1429
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,799
Uh yes. Uh thank you Greg for that great

1430
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,558
talk. Um, I was just wondering, you

1431
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,599
mentioned that heirloom varieties have

1432
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,599
been maintained by seeds savers and that

1433
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,599
kind of came out of a response to modern

1434
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,519
agriculture, modern breeding. So, how do

1435
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,079
they feel about highs? Is there

1436
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,039
acceptance within the existing heirloom

1437
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,798
community? Are they excited about

1438
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,759
disease resist resistance or are they

1439
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:09,920
kind of not liking this? That's a really

1440
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,839
good question. Uh the question was you

1441
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,720
know people who are really attracted to

1442
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,798
heirloom varieties for for various

1443
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:19,118
reasons how do they feel about hybrid

1444
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:21,679
versions of those heirlooms and I think

1445
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,720
there's a diversity of opinions um I

1446
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,039
think people who are interested in

1447
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:30,239
heirlooms primarily because of their

1448
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:32,239
flavor and appearance um are are open to

1449
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,719
to new varieties even if if they're

1450
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:38,399
hybrids. There are other people who have

1451
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:41,679
political opinions on on um F1 hybrids

1452
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,400
and the control of seed um intellectual

1453
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:45,919
property protection. Um those people

1454
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,920
probably aren't as thrilled about the

1455
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,119
development of of hybrid varieties.

1456
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,680
Um but you know these these heirloom

1457
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,200
varieties for the point of it only get

1458
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,118
them by you know writing a letter to

1459
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,519
somebody else who saved them. You know

1460
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,440
that that was that was a long time ago.

1461
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,920
These these varieties seed of them are

1462
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:07,039
sold by all sorts of major seed

1463
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,039
companies and and grown um commercially.

1464
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,039
Now

1465
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,318
that's all the time. So please

1466
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,798
awesome. Okay. So I have the honor of

1467
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,879
being I think the side of this symposium

1468
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:33,039
that's more about conservation which you

1469
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,400
might see or uh you might remember is in

1470
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,880
the title itself conserving and

1471
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,160
utilizing. So it feels like an honor and

1472
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,720
also um a responsibility to bring the

1473
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,239
other half of the equation to what seems

1474
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,558
like a really strong and wonderful

1475
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:49,279
community um mainly of plantreeders uh

1476
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,599
genetics folks and such. And so a great

1477
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,400
community to for me to connect with and

1478
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,160
to um speak with. Thank you for the

1479
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,920
invite to the the graduate student

1480
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,480
organizers and to Cornell and to

1481
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,960
Corteva. Really appreciate it and I do

1482
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,119
not take for granted opportunities to

1483
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,440
get together and collaborate um

1484
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,559
especially in this day and age. And so

1485
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,880
thank you.

1486
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:15,680
Um my goal I think above all else with

1487
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,039
this talk is to

1488
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,519
um engage you enroll you even in how

1489
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:24,639
important that side the conservation

1490
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:27,039
side is to your work. And so let's see

1491
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,279
how I do about that. This is a real

1492
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,039
photo by the way not just a screen

1493
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,440
saver. This is from the Great Sand Dunes

1494
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,880
National Park in Colorado. And that's a

1495
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,240
wild relative that I'll talk a little

1496
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,119
bit about a little bit

1497
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:41,598
later. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm going to be

1498
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,358
talking about things like this flower on

1499
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,720
the left side and its relation to the

1500
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:49,039
flower on the right side and

1501
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:51,000
um how those two are still related after

1502
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:54,798
so many millions of

1503
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,358
years. I just as a reflection um when I

1504
00:58:54,798 --> 00:59:00,318
started in this work like 25 years ago,

1505
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:02,078
I do feel like we were all the weirdos

1506
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,798
that they didn't know what to do with at

1507
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,960
the tri society's meetings. um we had

1508
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:08,960
sort of our own little group that nobody

1509
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,798
came to, you know, there's four people

1510
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,119
in the audience and all of that thing.

1511
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,000
That was the crop wild relative people.

1512
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,599
And I it's not I mean it's not that the

1513
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,679
plantreeders weren't using the wild

1514
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,480
relatives. They certainly were and all

1515
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:26,078
of that, but it was much lower on the

1516
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,519
awareness screen there I think at the

1517
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,920
societies and and also in the

1518
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,000
conservation world. And that's not true

1519
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,480
any longer. there has been this huge

1520
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,480
sort of shift as I've seen it into

1521
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,358
public awareness like all of these

1522
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,358
articles around wild foods or wild

1523
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,358
relatives or genetic resources even

1524
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,318
terms like that that you never thought

1525
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,598
might end up in the news and um you

1526
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,719
might have seen that the world food

1527
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,798
prize this year was given

1528
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,959
to conservationists including of wild

1529
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,480
relatives of crops and all kinds of

1530
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,199
crazy things are happening in the world

1531
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,280
with uh wild relatives and that's true

1532
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:06,960
not just of uh public awareness. But

1533
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:09,040
even in our very largest global or

1534
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,400
international accords and agreements,

1535
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,519
for instance, the sustainable

1536
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,960
development goals and the new agreements

1537
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:16,719
and the older agreements of the

1538
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
convention on biological diversity.

1539
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,759
These are really our largest

1540
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,319
international instruments of countries

1541
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,119
agreeing with each other about

1542
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:25,119
biodiversity, about food and

1543
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,838
agriculture. and they're all saying

1544
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,400
things like wild species and wild

1545
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,400
relatives in them, which is wild in and

1546
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,039
of itself. That actually was not an

1547
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,519
intentional

1548
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:40,719
um so I have a couple of slides that are

1549
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:43,679
a little bit simple for you all um in

1550
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,199
this group, but I will put a few

1551
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,838
definitions out and and a little bit of

1552
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,759
the history. For me, I keep it really

1553
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,199
simple. Wild relatives are wild plants

1554
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,920
that are related to our domesticated

1555
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,759
crops. As you saw from the tomato group

1556
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,798
um and from the brassasica talk and

1557
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,240
others, the exact definition or which

1558
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,880
plants are in and which plants are out

1559
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,558
for each crop varies um a lot. And the

1560
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,920
wheat one, the wheat talk coming up

1561
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,839
after me is um is another example of a

1562
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,920
different way of defining the edges of

1563
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:14,558
the wild relatives.

1564
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,639
The the theory behind this goes back 50

1565
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:21,119
years or 53 years now

1566
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:24,159
um to to some science that was really

1567
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,400
based mostly on crossing on on breeding

1568
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:28,239
studies and seeing what could cross with

1569
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,039
one another and the coming up with this

1570
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:33,439
kind of onion concept of the center

1571
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,199
being the crop and it's related spec

1572
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,200
same species that's wild and then as you

1573
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,000
go out from the onion it gets less

1574
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:42,078
related and more difficult to cross. Uh

1575
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,280
these days those boundaries have really

1576
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,599
fallen through modern tech and so you

1577
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,920
can um you can double chromosomes easier

1578
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,680
and you can do these bridges with other

1579
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,838
species as mentioned in Nebraska and all

1580
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,919
these things. And so the edges of the

1581
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,719
gene pool two and three and out from

1582
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,400
there are getting fuzzier over time. If

1583
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,318
you're interested in the the picture of

1584
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
like who is a wild relative for what

1585
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,920
crops you're interested in, there is a

1586
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,879
wonderful database, probably the only

1587
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,680
like truly global database run by USDA

1588
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,318
Grin Global Taxonomy with the link

1589
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:16,639
there. I hope these presentations um are

1590
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,318
available to everyone after this. Uh I'm

1591
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,318
happy to make mine, but there's a lot of

1592
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,159
links in this presentation. If useful to

1593
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:23,920
you, you can go there and you can put in

1594
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,558
your crop of interest and it will start

1595
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,318
to tell you based on literature who are

1596
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,960
the wild species and what have they been

1597
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:34,639
used for that has been published.

1598
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,798
Um there's been a couple of reviews of

1599
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:39,920
of the uses of wild relatives over the

1600
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:42,079
last uh 50 years or 100 years in this

1601
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,920
case and essentially the trends are

1602
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,359
there's more and more publications folks

1603
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,760
saying that they're using wild relatives

1604
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,679
and again this is not the private sector

1605
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,920
so much. This is this is what's being

1606
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,598
published. And so it's even higher the

1607
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,639
number of uses of course when you get

1608
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,160
into the privates. And then as as you

1609
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,639
might have seen already from the from

1610
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,920
the talks we've had the major major uses

1611
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,598
so far are primarily pest and disease

1612
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:10,119
resistance also abiotic stress uh

1613
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:12,960
tolerance and then many other things.

1614
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,039
Um two final points as we just get into

1615
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,039
it about wild relatives that I like to

1616
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,359
make. Again, you all as a very educated

1617
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:25,039
crowd um will not be surprised by this,

1618
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:27,838
but the the complexities of their use

1619
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,720
are wondrous and and it's there is of

1620
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,880
course still just bringing

1621
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:34,719
in single genes for important traits

1622
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,200
like pest resistance, but then there

1623
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,798
there's there's much more I'm not saying

1624
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,798
any better or worse, but much more

1625
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:45,038
complex versions like grape. And so what

1626
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:47,719
grape is for those who don't know and I

1627
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:52,400
know this is a big crop in in New York.

1628
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:53,838
Um grape has a top the scion that can be

1629
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,119
different than the bottom the root

1630
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:59,279
stock. That top scion is still mostly in

1631
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,599
most places in the world one species the

1632
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,480
domesticated species venifera but that

1633
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,838
is um that is not the only species

1634
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,079
that's out there. And in fact there's

1635
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,480
more and more coming along of hybrids

1636
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,318
with venifa and other things. And there

1637
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:17,039
is a case, this is a rather extreme case

1638
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:18,480
of um of this chambers which is we don't

1639
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,160
actually even know all the different

1640
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,480
species in it, but you can see the list

1641
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,480
of of six or actually seven different

1642
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,318
species actually in this hybrid that's

1643
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,559
that's u that's grown on the east coast

1644
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:35,000
here. And then the rootstock there is

1645
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:37,440
now um almost by standard or by

1646
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,280
definition one of three or four

1647
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,599
different wild species from North

1648
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,440
America. That's how grapes are really

1649
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,000
able to grow around the world for the

1650
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,318
most part. And so this is the landscape

1651
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,838
really of wild relatives and of how much

1652
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,599
they're used. They're they're really

1653
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,679
really integrated into some of our most

1654
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:57,519
major crops. And I had to put this

1655
01:04:53,679 --> 01:05:00,960
picture up here um for several reasons.

1656
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:04,798
One uh one is because this is a Cornell

1657
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,559
work seinal work from 25 years ago that

1658
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,318
was one of these papers that really did

1659
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,720
start to raise the awareness and change

1660
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:14,719
maybe people's minds uh even breeders

1661
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:17,879
minds about using wild relatives. And um

1662
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:23,399
so Dr. Makuch who's

1663
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:26,160
um maybe listening in online. Uh

1664
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,720
uh this is a kind of a synthesis paper

1665
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,558
and it was making a several points and

1666
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:33,439
one is that you don't always know what's

1667
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:36,720
in these plants which is the wonder and

1668
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,639
also the challenge of them. And so the

1669
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,399
photo here that the A was the wild

1670
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,480
relative um which was spoken about by

1671
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,920
our first speaker here. What a wonderful

1672
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,519
presentation. Thank you. I learned so

1673
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,240
much. the B on the the the left side

1674
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,119
there, that was the domesticated version

1675
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:55,199
before the integration. The the right

1676
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,000
side of that is actually after the cross

1677
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,719
with this green tomato. Um you get a

1678
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,239
darker red version of the of the tomato.

1679
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:06,639
So that darker um trait came actually

1680
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,558
from the wild green relative. And then

1681
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,038
on the bottom side on the sea, this is a

1682
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,760
smaller one. This is I believe

1683
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:13,680
pimpanellopolium crossing with that

1684
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,480
medium-sized tomato to get even a larger

1685
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,558
tomato through you know kind of um

1686
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,318
through that vigor effect and so you

1687
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,240
don't always know what you're going to

1688
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:25,279
get.

1689
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:27,519
Um okay so the talk that I am going to

1690
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,400
give today also as much as it's about

1691
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,798
plants and about genes and conservation

1692
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,639
it's really also about

1693
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:38,000
people conservation really can't happen

1694
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:41,000
by by an individual or an institution.

1695
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,760
It's a it's a

1696
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,760
collaborative effort. Um the bigger and

1697
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,000
more collaborative it is the more it

1698
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:51,039
works. Relationships matter to

1699
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,400
conservation tremendously. And so there

1700
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,960
was a big first step 15 years ago

1701
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,880
through a mega global project called the

1702
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,159
crop relatives project that was 50

1703
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,480
million uh euros through um the

1704
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,078
government of Norway and that enabled

1705
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,519
giant steps forward in trying to

1706
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,760
understand who are the wild relatives of

1707
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,599
our major crops uh how well are they

1708
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,880
conserved in seed banks or gene banks

1709
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,039
around the world I'll talk a little bit

1710
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,960
more about that in a minute and then um

1711
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,039
to start to do more pre-breeding around

1712
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,960
those this was an important project for

1713
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,520
me because I got to do my PhD as part of

1714
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,679
it and so I'm very thankful for that and

1715
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,920
um and I think it it's still having its

1716
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:30,159
major effects around the world many

1717
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,559
institutions including Cornell were part

1718
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:33,558
of this project

1719
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,599
um a little bit as part of that project

1720
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:41,038
on the far right side one of my chapters

1721
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:44,480
of my PhD uh was starting to just try to

1722
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,880
understand who are these resources in

1723
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,119
different countries and so we published

1724
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,519
an inventory for the United States of of

1725
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,119
what what is this diversity? And I'm I'm

1726
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,440
going to be talking mainly about North

1727
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,440
America in this uh presentation. So I

1728
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,440
wanted to list that Mexico came along

1729
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,880
with their version also in crop science

1730
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,880
a couple years later and then the

1731
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,280
Canadians a couple years later. And so

1732
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,640
we have wonderful now resources to just

1733
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,480
understand lists basically of all these

1734
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:12,960
species. And this is not it. There's

1735
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,719
probably 15 or 20 other countries that

1736
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,719
have now published national inventories

1737
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,198
for their wild relatives. And so that's

1738
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:23,359
a really neat baseline of um of

1739
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,678
understanding what's out there. And so

1740
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,560
to give you a short idea of of who's out

1741
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,319
there, um we have this pie chart that

1742
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,480
gives you a little sense

1743
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,798
of big the pie how big the slice is that

1744
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,559
are related to these major crops. And

1745
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,039
this is the narrowed down like most

1746
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,480
prioritized set of species that we

1747
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,719
prioritize basically based on how

1748
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,559
important the crop is. And so we've got

1749
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,960
a lot of blackberry and blueberry

1750
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,440
relatives and grapes and pecans and

1751
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,920
peaches and plums and sunflowers and and

1752
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:56,358
other things there. And so um I would

1753
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,719
like to talk actually for a minute about

1754
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:02,079
why we have diversity of crops in North

1755
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,359
America, which I'm just going to talk

1756
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:08,798
about the United States and Canada when

1757
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:11,039
not that many crops were domesticated in

1758
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,359
this area.

1759
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,359
So, this is a map I worked on a while

1760
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,838
back that it's certainly not every crop

1761
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,798
in the world, but it's most of the crops

1762
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,039
that we eat. It's about 80 or 100 crops

1763
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:24,640
and let's just call it where they where

1764
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,798
they came from, if you allow me that. I

1765
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,960
know you're a very educated crowd, but

1766
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:30,640
where where more or less they arose the

1767
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,480
region part of the world and where their

1768
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,319
where their genetic diversity is is

1769
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,039
richest and where their wild relatives

1770
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,679
tend to be richest. And you can see a

1771
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:41,759
few things here. One is that plants were

1772
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,319
domesticated in many parts of the world.

1773
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,960
So were animals, not just one place. I

1774
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,359
believe I was taught in high school, I'm

1775
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,359
still angry about this, that uh that

1776
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,239
that agriculture arose in the fertile

1777
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:57,320
crescent and that was the whole

1778
01:09:53,238 --> 01:10:00,439
story. It's not the whole story.

1779
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:03,599
Um uh

1780
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:06,960
so actually many dozens or even hundreds

1781
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,320
of places crops were domesticated by

1782
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:12,719
hundreds or thousands of cultures. And

1783
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:16,319
uh that's typically understood to be

1784
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:18,079
maybe 28 to 32 kind of very rich centers

1785
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,039
where a lot of innovation was going on

1786
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,960
typically 4,000 to 12,000 years ago. You

1787
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:25,519
can also see that North America is not

1788
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,359
the biggest list. It's it's it's it's

1789
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,280
kind of a smaller list. This is again

1790
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,839
not the whole list of crops, but there's

1791
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,840
blueberries there and um those currants

1792
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,319
or rybees, grapes, some pumpkins,

1793
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:42,640
sunflowers, strawberries, pecans, some

1794
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:44,399
other things. So um I have four reasons

1795
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,440
I'm going to try to argue for with you

1796
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:49,679
of why we actually have this giant

1797
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:52,158
inventory of 5,000 species that are

1798
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,800
related to crops here in North America.

1799
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,879
And the first one is because we do have

1800
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,320
these native domesticates. That is

1801
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,440
people that were here in this part of

1802
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,279
the world were checking out the wild

1803
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,879
plants and realized that some of them

1804
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,198
were really awesome and started growing

1805
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,640
them and domesticating them and they got

1806
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:10,960
bigger and more useful and more edible

1807
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,119
and and um and their wild relatives are

1808
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,039
are still here. So that's number one. We

1809
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:18,880
got that. Number two is that there is a

1810
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,840
very rich diversity of crops that were

1811
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,640
domesticated south of here. Meso America

1812
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,800
and further south. That's corn and other

1813
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,440
types of squash and chili peppers and

1814
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,960
potatoes and tomatoes and and many other

1815
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:34,799
things. And they have wild

1816
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,560
relatives, cousins, northern cousins,

1817
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,400
ones that live up here in more temperate

1818
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,039
regions, but are related to those crops

1819
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,039
to the south. And so, um, for instance,

1820
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:45,119
typicum, which is a wild relative of

1821
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,960
mae, and there's a a researcher of that

1822
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,198
here, Dr. Denise Costich in the crowd.

1823
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,800
And so that's a kind of let's call it a

1824
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,119
there's versions that are more temperate

1825
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,079
of maze that are up here. That's number

1826
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:58,640
two. Uh number three is that as a

1827
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:00,800
temperate region we also have cousins or

1828
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,079
wild relatives that are cousins to crops

1829
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,239
that were domesticated in other

1830
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,880
temperate regions of the world in Europe

1831
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:10,000
and in East Asia. And uh so there's a

1832
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,079
lot of wild plums and apricots and

1833
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,679
almonds and things like that that were

1834
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,439
the domesticates were domesticated

1835
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:19,119
elsewhere but the relatives are also

1836
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:22,238
here. Um, and number four is that we

1837
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:25,039
have weeds, invasives that come from

1838
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:27,439
other places, and those are problematic

1839
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:31,319
as weeds. Things like in in the west

1840
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:34,399
where I'm from, wild oats or um or wild

1841
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:36,319
beets, wild lettuce, but they are also

1842
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,839
genetic resources and they are also crop

1843
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:39,840
wild relatives and they can be used for

1844
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,679
breeding as well. So those are the four

1845
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,880
reasons, my major four reasons why this

1846
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,079
is actually a very rich part of the

1847
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,239
world even though other parts of the

1848
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,238
world are just as rich in this

1849
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,559
incredible flora that is useful for

1850
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:53,678
people through plant breeding and um as

1851
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,520
we'll talk about at the end of this

1852
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,520
presentation for for other reasons

1853
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,719
too. So um we have been using wild

1854
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,559
relatives for a long time that are

1855
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,840
native to this region. This is just four

1856
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,000
examples of of real uses of our native

1857
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,960
resources in wild relatives in in

1858
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,719
sunflowers and in um in filberts or

1859
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:23,279
hazelnuts in maze and in um uh walnut.

1860
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,640
The other side of the story and and my

1861
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,399
contractual obligation as a

1862
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,039
conservationist to start really into

1863
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:31,759
this conservation uh story here is that

1864
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,760
unfortunately a lot of those species are

1865
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,640
threatened or endangered and and these

1866
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,560
are all four of these are listed under

1867
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,239
endangered species act. Many of the

1868
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,920
species are not listed but these are

1869
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,639
lucky enough I suppose you could call it

1870
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,079
to be uh to be listed and regulated

1871
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,880
there. And so what do we do about these

1872
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:55,640
species that are useful to us, that are

1873
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,840
wild, that are threatened?

1874
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,239
Um, one of the things that we do is we

1875
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,360
put them in seed banks or, uh, gan banks

1876
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:05,519
as we we like to call them. And, uh,

1877
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,839
this is a picture from the National

1878
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,920
Laboratory in Fort Collins located in

1879
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,560
Colorado State University. It's a USDA

1880
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,520
facility. uh the full term is national

1881
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,520
laboratory for genetic resources

1882
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,840
preservation. This is the national

1883
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,640
backup repository for the United States

1884
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,520
system and uh our previous speaker who

1885
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,320
spoke about the use of the brassasica

1886
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,800
collection from USDA. This would be

1887
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:34,399
where the long-term collection that's

1888
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,560
kept for decades or hundreds of years is

1889
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:39,039
kept to make sure that it stays alive

1890
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,280
and is around and um and can be

1891
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,359
replenished out into the more active

1892
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,039
sites. The active sites I'd like to talk

1893
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,359
about this system just for a minute if

1894
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:49,359
you will. The active sites in the USDA

1895
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:52,238
system are all across the United States.

1896
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:54,238
And that's that that makes sense because

1897
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,519
crops grow different crops grow in

1898
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,759
different parts of the United States and

1899
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,440
and the desire is to to have these

1900
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,840
active sites really working in in the

1901
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:05,759
right ecologies. Um that system is the

1902
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,400
largest probably national system in the

1903
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,199
world in terms of how active it it is in

1904
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,519
doing um doing the research to keep the

1905
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,198
seeds alive but also developing useful

1906
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,440
information like what color and what

1907
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,599
size and all of that basic phenotyping

1908
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:23,919
work and then distributing seeds to

1909
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:26,960
plantreeders. And so what I really want

1910
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,359
to make sure is understood is that this

1911
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,279
is a this is one national system.

1912
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,679
There's there's many around the world

1913
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,599
which I'll get to in a minute. But that

1914
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:38,800
national system which is supported by

1915
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,560
the public then is one of the major

1916
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,400
foundations for plant breeding through

1917
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,320
universities through private industry

1918
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,319
that then become the seeds that go out

1919
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:52,960
to farmers around the world. And without

1920
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:55,679
that system um it would be a much more

1921
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,399
fragile or unstable system going forward

1922
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:02,239
in terms of the future of new varieties

1923
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:04,079
and food. And so um we even have backups

1924
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:05,839
of backups. This is probably the most

1925
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:09,600
famous seed bankank or team bank around

1926
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,679
the world global seed vault which is um

1927
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,159
which is our tertiary backup here in the

1928
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,840
United States. that is we put seeds uh

1929
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:18,319
we have our active sites and then we put

1930
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,119
them in Colorado and then we also put

1931
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:23,119
them in Spalbard which is a Norwegian

1932
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,599
territory. For other countries they

1933
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:28,640
don't have that Colorado version and so

1934
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,679
their backup is at Spalbard. This is

1935
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,440
like a safety deposit box. Um you don't

1936
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,880
pay for it as a country but you put your

1937
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:36,639
seats up there and nobody else has

1938
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,600
access to them except you so you can get

1939
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,679
them back when you need them.

1940
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,000
This is a picture of all the gene banks

1941
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,520
around the world more or less and the

1942
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,439
size of the circle is the size of the

1943
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,800
collections just in terms of number of

1944
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,639
what are called excessions there. These

1945
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,119
are both national seed banks or gene

1946
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,440
banks but also international ones which

1947
01:16:55,119 --> 01:17:02,000
are held in trust kind of for the global

1948
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:03,519
community not just for a country. Um but

1949
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,079
I want to mention even with the national

1950
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,679
ones like the USDA they're they're not

1951
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,439
considered only for the country

1952
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,960
themselves. In fact, the distributions

1953
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:13,519
go out around the world. And so it

1954
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,439
really is a it's a global network. And

1955
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,600
that makes sense because of that earlier

1956
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,678
map that you might remember that crops

1957
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,679
came from places, but but we need them

1958
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,719
everywhere. We grow them everywhere. The

1959
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:27,239
major crops at least. Maize is vital in

1960
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,840
Africa and rice is vital in South

1961
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,519
America. For all of those reasons, we

1962
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:35,480
need genetic resources to be able to

1963
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,480
flow across the world.

1964
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,600
So,

1965
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:42,560
um, how do you figure out if your

1966
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,960
collections are complete? Uh, if you

1967
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,960
need to go collect more, how are we

1968
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,880
doing in terms of, um, making sure that

1969
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,920
the these plants that are threatened in

1970
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,159
the wild because of habitat destruction

1971
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,600
because of pollution, contamination, and

1972
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,119
um, overh harvesting and all kinds of

1973
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,840
things. How do we make sure that they're

1974
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,640
in the seed bankanks? So there is there

1975
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,920
are techniques that are geographic to

1976
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,840
try to start to understand where the

1977
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,679
species live and whether we've gone to

1978
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,840
collect them. And that was a good part

1979
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:11,840
of my PhD was starting to do research

1980
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,319
like this. This is this is basically the

1981
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,560
richness of beans of fasiololis the

1982
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:18,399
whole group of 80 or so species. And

1983
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,000
that darker color in the middle is where

1984
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,639
the where they're richest in the world

1985
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,800
which is central Mexico. And then the

1986
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,400
picture on the right is um where they

1987
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,480
are richest but we have not collected

1988
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:32,960
them well enough yet. And so um that

1989
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,439
also became a major paper during that

1990
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,920
global project that was kind of all the

1991
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,158
wild relatives uh of all the mo major

1992
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,760
crops around the world over a thousand

1993
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,399
wild relatives that we consider the most

1994
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,640
important. And so this is this is an old

1995
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,119
figure. It's It's actually a little bit

1996
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,800
hard to see at this point, but the um

1997
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:55,760
the dark red would be the richest places

1998
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,440
to go for wild relatives um if you

1999
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:01,520
wanted to find as many as you could in

2000
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:03,119
one single 5 kilometer x 5 km grid. But

2001
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,280
let me just get a little bit more into

2002
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,279
the methodology that we use to try to

2003
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:08,800
explain it um what we're trying to do

2004
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,880
here on the conservation side or

2005
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,199
planning side. So this is just one of

2006
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,560
our wild grapes that occurs in Texas.

2007
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:20,719
Um, sweet mountain grape. And what we do

2008
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:23,360
is we bring in information that come

2009
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,960
typically from plant museums called

2010
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,960
herbaria

2011
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,359
uh or other types of museums or

2012
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,760
increasingly from

2013
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:34,238
um from citizen science applications

2014
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,159
like I naturalist where people have

2015
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:38,079
marked I've seen this in the wild and

2016
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:41,279
this is where I saw it which you can now

2017
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:43,359
do on your phone very easily and um map

2018
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:47,519
those. So, so this is where the species

2019
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,839
has been seen, uh, those gray spots. So,

2020
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,840
it occurs basically in central Texas.

2021
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,279
And, um, there's one other dot that

2022
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,719
you'll see there, which is the same kind

2023
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,920
of thing, except this is actually where

2024
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:00,560
it's been collected and put into a germ

2025
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,119
plasm repository, a seedbank or or a

2026
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,920
botanic gardenard. And so, you could

2027
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:07,760
already get a sense that, okay, well,

2028
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,719
it's been collected once from one spot

2029
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,400
in the farthest north. Is that enough?

2030
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,640
Do we have all the genetics that we need

2031
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,839
in the future? Maybe, maybe not. Okay.

2032
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:20,960
So now all this geog geographic stuff is

2033
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,960
based on hypotheses that geography has a

2034
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,198
relationship to genetic diversity. That

2035
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,039
is if you go to somewhere different then

2036
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,839
you'll get different genetic diversity.

2037
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:31,198
And so we do some modeling. So this is a

2038
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,960
guesstimate of where we think the

2039
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:36,238
species occurs based on where we've seen

2040
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,600
it plus climate and soil um attributes.

2041
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,319
And so the green is where we think the

2042
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,320
species might occur. And then we can

2043
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:44,079
draw a buffer around where we've already

2044
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:45,519
gone and collected and say, "Okay, we

2045
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,600
maybe we don't need to go back there in

2046
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,960
the purple, but all of the orange,

2047
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,480
everything that's left of the

2048
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,079
distribution we haven't been to is where

2049
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,678
we might want to go back to and collect

2050
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:57,439
more of." And that's what we call

2051
01:20:53,679 --> 01:21:00,399
conservation gap analysis. Um, and so

2052
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:02,559
actually 12.5% of the distribution, the

2053
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:04,559
the posited distribution of the species

2054
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,960
has been collected from and the rest

2055
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,719
hasn't yet in terms of this rather

2056
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,640
simple methodology.

2057
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:12,319
Um we have some other metrics that try

2058
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,719
to collect from every different eco

2059
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,479
region or different soil type and such

2060
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,039
to try to get an idea of sort of the

2061
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,959
ecological variation. And then the other

2062
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,560
side of it is now not thinking so much

2063
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,319
about gene banks or seed bankanks but

2064
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,039
thinking about how well protected are

2065
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:29,519
these species in the wild that is in

2066
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:31,399
national parks, forests and such. And so

2067
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,880
we have a similar methodology for

2068
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:37,119
institu of um essentially how much of

2069
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,319
that range is in national parks and

2070
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,079
such.

2071
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:44,000
So, this was put together a few years

2072
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:45,760
ago into a national gap analysis that um

2073
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,479
that tells us how we're doing in terms

2074
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,039
of 600 of our native wild relatives here

2075
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,198
in the United States. And this map is a

2076
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:57,359
heat map, a richness map of all of them

2077
01:21:53,198 --> 01:22:00,238
together, 600 species. And um what I I'd

2078
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:03,599
like hopefully to get two messages out

2079
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:06,718
of this. One is no matter where you go,

2080
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,120
there's a wild relative underneath you.

2081
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,920
um even just these 600 most important to

2082
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,840
us uh in terms of relation to very

2083
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,239
important crops and such. The other

2084
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,560
thing is up here in New York, maybe

2085
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:20,799
you're slightly out of that red, but

2086
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,440
you're in a hot spot pretty much here,

2087
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,279
too. So, there's a lot going on all over

2088
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,119
the place. The darker colors is more

2089
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,880
species occurring in the in the same

2090
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:34,519
areas there.

2091
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:37,600
Congratulations. Um you got work to do.

2092
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,280
So um these are the kind of metrics that

2093
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,800
we came up with to try to understand how

2094
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:45,759
we're doing and I mentioned a series of

2095
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,000
metrics around XC2 conservation status

2096
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,400
that's in seed bankanks ganks or botanic

2097
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,359
gardens and then the other side is in

2098
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,039
protected areas that's in C2

2099
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:56,960
conservation and this each of these

2100
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:59,679
black dots is one of the species one of

2101
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,520
the 600. Um, we have this scale from

2102
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,760
zero, which is we're doing very terrible

2103
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,679
on our conservation, and 100 is you're

2104
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,159
done. And that's why you can see green

2105
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,960
over there versus red. And you can kind

2106
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,638
of get a sense now. Um, XC2, we got a

2107
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,399
lot of work to do. Most of the species

2108
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,279
are in that high urgent priority

2109
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,960
category for further collecting. In C2

2110
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,920
is a little bit better. If you combine

2111
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,760
them, we still got a lot of work to do.

2112
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,840
This is just grouping the species in

2113
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,840
slightly different ways into the types

2114
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:31,279
of crops or their their um their

2115
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:34,719
associated crop itself. And I'll just

2116
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:34,719
take some water while you take a look at

2117
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:41,600
this. All right. So, another contractual

2118
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:42,718
obligation of being a conservation is

2119
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,600
just, you know, to have the doom and

2120
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,800
gloom story just a little bit. Um, so

2121
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,239
there's my doom and gloom story. We got

2122
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,159
a lot we got a lot to do to really

2123
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:51,839
conserve these resources. But again, let

2124
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,679
me just emphasize, if we don't have them

2125
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,440
in the seed bankanks and gene banks,

2126
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,719
they're really not that accessible for

2127
01:23:55,439 --> 01:24:00,759
the plantreeders, right? And so we got

2128
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,359
to be doing that work.

2129
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,199
Um, so how do we also make this

2130
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:06,960
information useful so people can go out

2131
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:08,799
and do that work? We've been building

2132
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,399
websites and making the information

2133
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,159
publicly available and all of that. So,

2134
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:14,799
this is a really great website where you

2135
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:18,719
can actually explore those 600 species

2136
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:20,239
uh on a USDA RTIS basically site and um

2137
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,079
try to get to know where they are and

2138
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,000
how well they've been collected. If

2139
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,079
you're a coder, we've developed an R

2140
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
code called gap analysis.r where you can

2141
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,359
do your own analyses. Um and we're

2142
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,158
rebooting that because it's a little bit

2143
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:34,399
outdated right now with its

2144
01:24:31,158 --> 01:24:37,439
packages. Um very excited that we're now

2145
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:39,198
working on a project for the non-coders,

2146
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:43,839
which are most gene bank people, by the

2147
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:46,000
way. um where online you can uh bring in

2148
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,480
data from some of these big global

2149
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
database uh sites like GBIFF which is

2150
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,638
the global biodiversity information

2151
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,560
facility or I naturalist and then you

2152
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,560
can bring in your own data as well. You

2153
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,560
can figure out which of those points are

2154
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,039
just sightings versus which ones are

2155
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,280
actually in GMES or Botanic Gardens. You

2156
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:05,119
can um make your own buffer size and you

2157
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:07,359
can do your own gap analysis. This is

2158
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:09,359
not quite yet ready for you can go play

2159
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:11,519
with it already on that on that link uh

2160
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,719
or there's a link on my last um on the

2161
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,000
last slide but uh another year and

2162
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:18,560
hopefully this will be really ready for

2163
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,359
prime time. I will say unfortunately

2164
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,960
this project uh was just canceled um due

2165
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,399
to federal funding but we're hoping to

2166
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,719
still move it forward.

2167
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:31,679
Um I naturalist I just I I have fallen

2168
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:34,239
in love with citizen science myself. Um

2169
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,560
just mentioning I created this own group

2170
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:37,759
project on I naturalist of just what are

2171
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,159
these wild relatives in the United

2172
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,840
States and there are 2.7 million

2173
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:44,079
observations

2174
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,920
uh of of observations of these species

2175
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:48,880
around the country. And so what an

2176
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,119
incredible resource even if 10% of them

2177
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,119
are are misidentified. What an

2178
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,800
incredible resource. It really doesn't

2179
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:57,279
matter. The amount of information on

2180
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,520
them is is just incredible. And I'm I'm

2181
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:00,759
fully in on the citizen science thing.

2182
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,120
It's

2183
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,960
incredible. We've been working with our

2184
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:07,439
Forest Service and other land management

2185
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,000
partners to understand what's on their

2186
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:12,960
lands and um and and to be able to

2187
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,760
protect them better. This is kind of

2188
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,000
this is a really incredible story of how

2189
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,560
these collaborations started with land

2190
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,238
managers in the United States some 2530

2191
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:27,920
years ago. We actually had a designation

2192
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:29,759
already of a um an area that was on

2193
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,158
forest service land but hadn't been

2194
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:36,000
designated yet for anything around

2195
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:38,479
botanical interest and it was designated

2196
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,158
as a wild chili botanical preserve. It's

2197
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,479
south of Tucson. If you're ever in that

2198
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:45,359
area, um you can go you can go see it.

2199
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:48,319
And so it's still special. Essentially

2200
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:50,880
uh the US only has one or two really

2201
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,279
sites on public lands that are

2202
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,359
explicitly to conserve a cropot relative

2203
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:57,279
and this is one of them. Why is it

2204
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:59,599
there? Well, this is the progenitor of

2205
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,359
chili pepper capsmanuum and it just

2206
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,360
barely creeps up into the United States

2207
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:04,799
and a couple of places in Texas, Arizona

2208
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,479
and this is conserving one of those

2209
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,000
populations which is near

2210
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:12,158
Tucson. Very cool.

2211
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,399
So trying to expand that work by letting

2212
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,000
the Forest Service know what's on their

2213
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:17,839
lands. And so we're doing that kind of

2214
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
modeling for them on all forest service

2215
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:23,360
lands of which species might be there

2216
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,719
and then um going out and a further

2217
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,479
version of that that then starts to

2218
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,880
integrate genetics which is really fun

2219
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:30,959
is a wild cranberry project which is a

2220
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,920
collaboration between USDA's a research

2221
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,920
service and forest service in

2222
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,440
identifying in this case actually across

2223
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:41,760
most of the east coast um different

2224
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,439
populations of wild cranberries and then

2225
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,360
doing genetics to figure out how much

2226
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:48,000
they differ genetically. to identify

2227
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:50,238
kind of the most interestingly different

2228
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,238
populations that might be specifically

2229
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:54,238
designated in these in these categories.

2230
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,479
And so you can see just by the

2231
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,039
vegetation here how different the

2232
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,479
ecologies are. This is everything from

2233
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,960
um well actually there's some west coast

2234
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:05,718
stuff here, but everything from kind of

2235
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:10,239
um north all the way south to West

2236
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:10,239
Virginia. And so pretty cool

2237
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,039
stuff. This presentation is certainly

2238
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,920
not just my research. It's also

2239
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:19,198
colleagues around the around the the the

2240
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,880
continent around the world that are

2241
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:23,759
doing work. And so just a little bit on

2242
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:26,239
the Canadian and Mexican efforts here.

2243
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,840
Uh there has been as mentioned quite a

2244
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:29,359
lot of just inventorying and then

2245
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:33,440
mapping and trying to understand where

2246
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:36,158
the species are. And so as thought and

2247
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:38,238
as expected along the southern border of

2248
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:40,879
of Canada is where you get the richest.

2249
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:43,599
And that's also true um to some degree

2250
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,279
in the United States. Although as you

2251
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,880
saw there is this northern range because

2252
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,238
of so many berries and things that are

2253
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,760
more temperate there. But we have a lot

2254
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,359
of richness also on our southern border

2255
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,639
in Texas and Arizona, New Mexico,

2256
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:56,639
Florida. A lot of berries up there in

2257
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:58,079
Canada that are that are I think a lot

2258
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,840
of the efforts of the people who are

2259
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,760
most active right now doing work in

2260
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,199
Canada on on the native wild relatives

2261
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,000
are around their cranberries which are

2262
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:10,319
culturally significant um also

2263
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:14,000
significant for wildlife etc.

2264
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:17,119
Mexico. Um, huge diversity also a lot of

2265
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,800
studies of of who they are and what

2266
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:21,158
their risks are in terms of

2267
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,800
disappearance.

2268
01:29:21,158 --> 01:29:27,839
Um, I want to convey a message that I've

2269
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:31,360
has been driven home to me by colleagues

2270
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,560
from Mexico, which is somewhat of a

2271
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:35,599
different way of framing and

2272
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:39,360
understanding these species because

2273
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:41,760
there is still a lot of in uh

2274
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:44,479
integration with traditional agriculture

2275
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:47,199
with the wild relatives. And so there

2276
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:49,599
are systems still with beans and maize

2277
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:52,319
and other cultivation systems where the

2278
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:55,679
wild relatives are occurring in the same

2279
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:59,439
area as the domesticated fields and

2280
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:02,800
there is gene flow often both ways. And

2281
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:04,479
so they're understood in less is just

2282
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,400
sort of this kind of historic thing that

2283
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:08,959
you can bring genes and take them and

2284
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:11,119
put them in. um but also as part of this

2285
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,119
dynamic system of traditional

2286
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:16,319
agriculture where there is still gene

2287
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:17,840
flow and uh and that is that is a

2288
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,119
different way of seeing it and and an

2289
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:23,840
important aspect

2290
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:25,760
there. We've been doing work together uh

2291
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,840
publishing books and such around what

2292
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,639
what is this richness and what are we

2293
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,840
doing about it a couple of volumes if

2294
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,960
you're interested in over a thousand

2295
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:37,039
pages of North American crop relatives

2296
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,760
and then starting to really reach out to

2297
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:44,719
a wider audience including the public

2298
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:46,320
and um eaters uh diners if you will

2299
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,960
around these wild relatives or wild

2300
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:50,158
foods. And so this is an example of of

2301
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,399
several different events that we've

2302
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,879
done. This one was in Tucson where it's

2303
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:57,519
a wonky I think it's a funny experiment

2304
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:59,440
in of itself. Can you kind of do wonky

2305
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,840
sciency stuff? Bring together scientists

2306
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,839
and talk about these things. Can you

2307
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,800
also throw parties for the public uh

2308
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,560
with chefs that bring in um that bring

2309
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:12,000
in the public that want to taste

2310
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:13,760
alcohols made from wild relatives or um

2311
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,279
interesting food? Can you go down to

2312
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,920
preserves like the Wild Chili Preserve

2313
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:19,279
and see them? And it's a it's a

2314
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,600
interesting experiment. I think it's

2315
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,439
been very fun uh to try to to try to

2316
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:29,400
message this still kind

2317
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:33,039
of middle land between wild wildness and

2318
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:35,679
agriculture threats and food security

2319
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:37,439
all together into a a message that kind

2320
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,359
of combines all of our challenges in the

2321
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,439
world and all of our our issues we got

2322
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,960
to work on.

2323
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:45,039
I've been working in the botanic garden

2324
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,480
world for the last four years and so I

2325
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:49,439
want to mention that because it's the

2326
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:51,119
other side of the whole world of XC2

2327
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:54,960
conservation. That is where we put

2328
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:57,920
things into frozen storage or into live

2329
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,600
plants and gardens. And just as you saw

2330
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,279
that picture of all the gene banks

2331
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,120
around the world, there is also these

2332
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:05,279
thousands of botanic gardens around the

2333
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:07,840
world who are also holding crops

2334
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:09,359
actually and their wild relatives and

2335
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,400
they do it for somewhat different

2336
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:13,960
purposes. Um but we're we're making

2337
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,839
efforts to come together to do

2338
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,439
conservation alto together all of our

2339
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:22,239
repositories. And so one of the ways for

2340
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:23,919
arguing for that which is a little

2341
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,439
simple but if you'll allow me this is

2342
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,239
another map of the richness of wild

2343
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:31,119
relatives in this area but those uh

2344
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:33,039
buildings are the different USDA sites

2345
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,439
that I mentioned the active research

2346
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:38,079
active research and collection sites.

2347
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:40,000
Colorado's there uh in the middle there.

2348
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:41,760
Um, so you can imagine the number of

2349
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,840
different people working there and what

2350
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,760
they're able to do. But then you map all

2351
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,679
the botanic gardens on top of that and

2352
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,679
all their botanical expertise around

2353
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,440
being able to identify species or go out

2354
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,719
or collect and all of that. You might

2355
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:57,279
imagine that you could do more working

2356
01:32:53,719 --> 01:32:59,520
together. And so um, I got to be part of

2357
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:03,920
a really fun project almost 10 years ago

2358
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:06,840
that Dr. Mark Zell also up there was

2359
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,520
part of. And

2360
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,760
um we had never met each other actually

2361
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,280
before and it was really really cool. We

2362
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,119
were both on the sort of the more a

2363
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:17,439
side. There was all these botanic garden

2364
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:20,319
people that had never met and it was all

2365
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:22,479
about like could we work together and um

2366
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:25,759
could we do something on crop relatives

2367
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:29,599
and so we decided through that to come

2368
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,520
up with a roadmap for North America on

2369
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,199
what do we got to do? And we published

2370
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,719
that in the crop journal. We published

2371
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:36,559
it in a botanic garden journal. We

2372
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,639
published it for land managers and it

2373
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,239
has five tenants to it. This is kind of

2374
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,199
the big picture of how do we deal with

2375
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,718
this giant richness of diversity that is

2376
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:46,960
threatened that is important for our

2377
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,719
food security that plantreeders need.

2378
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,639
And so the first one is we still got to

2379
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,920
do science about who are these species

2380
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,159
and where do they live and how well

2381
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,600
collected they are. Uh the second one is

2382
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,559
we got to protect them in their natural

2383
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,239
habitats. Why? If they're not in still

2384
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,840
evolving in their natural habitats, then

2385
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:03,839
they're not evolving alongside pest and

2386
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,920
diseases and changes in the weather and

2387
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,079
climate and all of those things. Um, the

2388
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,440
third is we got to put them in the seed

2389
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:10,880
bankanks and gene banks so that they're

2390
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,719
conserved for the long term, but they're

2391
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,960
also available to plant breeders and

2392
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:17,039
others. The fourth is we got to do the

2393
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,520
value addition of phenotyping and all of

2394
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,279
that stuff, pre-ereading to get them

2395
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,880
ready. And then the fifth one is public

2396
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:25,279
awareness and outreach, which the

2397
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:28,319
Botanic Gardens are particularly posed

2398
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:31,039
to do good work on.

2399
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:32,719
Um, and so just a couple kind of last

2400
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:35,119
slides that are about that that

2401
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:37,600
networking or that that growing network

2402
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:39,840
of people that are really working on it.

2403
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,199
So as the botanic garden world then and

2404
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,400
the gene bank world has come together,

2405
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:45,359
we've tried to figure out what is the

2406
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:47,599
lowhanging fruit for us to work on. And

2407
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:51,198
it actually turns out that fruit um and

2408
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:54,960
nuts is is a lowhanging fruit for us

2409
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:58,000
because gardens have live trees. They

2410
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:00,319
often have whole plants and have enough

2411
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
space for them. Whereas the gene banks

2412
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,679
struggle to have enough field space for

2413
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
them. And so it makes a lot of sense to

2414
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,440
work together in that way. There's

2415
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,880
gardens that have giant apple

2416
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:11,759
collections. For instance, the New York

2417
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,279
Botanical Garden in the Bronx. And so

2418
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,639
this is a network that's been happening

2419
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:17,119
for a couple of years. It's working on

2420
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:19,039
these 10 genera. If you're interested in

2421
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:21,359
any of them, please uh get in touch with

2422
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:23,279
me. And it's a very active network of

2423
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:25,279
understanding who the species are. It's

2424
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,039
got a little bit of money so that uh

2425
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,559
folks can go out and do collecting and

2426
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,639
then bring them into the botanic gardens

2427
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,840
or gan banks. And this is three pictures

2428
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:36,639
from um my own work at the San Diego

2429
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,360
Botanic Garden uh uh bringing in these

2430
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:41,119
collections. This is two wild plums from

2431
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:42,719
native to California. One of which is

2432
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:45,519
very very rare and endangered, the

2433
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:48,560
desert one on the left and then uh a

2434
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:50,159
wild walnut in the middle. It's really

2435
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,600
fun. It's it's a great network of

2436
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,920
people.

2437
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,719
We also put on a symposium last year

2438
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:59,520
that was quite an experiment I would say

2439
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:02,239
as well. It's kind of a reboot after

2440
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:05,120
that first um work 10 years ago of

2441
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:09,279
getting together and it was um where are

2442
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:11,359
we at and how do we go forward and what

2443
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,039
I there's still some really good

2444
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,799
resources on that website that you'll be

2445
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:18,158
able to find um there. But um yeah,

2446
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,400
before I get to that, let me just go

2447
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:21,399
back here.

2448
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:30,399
So one thing that I really hope to

2449
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:33,840
express is that I think also in the last

2450
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:37,519
20 years as our working in this field

2451
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,840
has deepened in this region we've also

2452
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,760
started to move

2453
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:44,119
beyond

2454
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:46,320
that that simpler understanding at first

2455
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:48,639
that all we're doing really is just

2456
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,559
grabbing jeans and bringing them over

2457
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,880
which is wonderful and important. It's

2458
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,840
not there's nothing at all wrong with

2459
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,039
that. But the bigger picture of what are

2460
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:01,520
these wild plants and how can they be

2461
01:36:58,039 --> 01:37:06,319
used and that has broken down all kinds

2462
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:07,239
of terminological silos like wild or

2463
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:11,000
even

2464
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:13,439
crop. Uh let me just repeat that. So

2465
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,960
like crop what is a first of all what is

2466
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:19,678
a crop? Um does it have to be

2467
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,198
cultivated? So, what about the plants

2468
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,960
here in North America that aren't

2469
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,439
particularly cultivated but are food

2470
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:28,319
resources and very interesting like paw

2471
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:30,399
paws or a plant I'm about to show you in

2472
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:32,559
a minute. And then what the heck is wild

2473
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:34,638
mean anyway as we start to realize that

2474
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,560
people have been managing wild

2475
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,639
populations forever anyway through

2476
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,520
burning or or selecting or management.

2477
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,279
And so our our our understanding is less

2478
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,040
now that there's just wild stuff and you

2479
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:48,238
bring it over into the domesticate, but

2480
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:50,238
there's this giant spectrum of plants

2481
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:52,079
that have been associated to more or

2482
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,319
less of a degree with people for

2483
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:56,238
thousands of years and we're still in

2484
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,759
there somewhere. And what do we want to

2485
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:01,039
do about that? Where do we want to go

2486
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,719
forward from here? And um I'll get back

2487
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:05,439
to that in a minute for a last point.

2488
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:07,760
But on the networking side, I wanted to

2489
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:09,678
mention something actually very

2490
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,280
exciting. And that's that in the botanic

2491
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,440
garden world, they've started to have

2492
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,840
these global networks to do important

2493
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:18,399
work on really important taxonomic

2494
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:20,199
groups like oaks or psychids. There's a

2495
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:23,198
psychid out in that nice little green

2496
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:25,118
area out there. And these are often very

2497
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,118
threatened plants. And and it's this

2498
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,039
whole group of thousands of institutions

2499
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,519
through a network like this getting

2500
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:34,238
together to conserve all the species.

2501
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:36,440
And I'm very um excited and proud to say

2502
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:41,759
that uh

2503
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:44,960
the 10th no sorry the 12th

2504
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,960
um quick math there uh the the 12th

2505
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:50,239
global conservation consortium has just

2506
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,439
been uh just been agreed upon for the

2507
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:53,279
world and it's going to be focused on

2508
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:55,039
food plants including cropot relatives

2509
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,000
and so that really brings the whole

2510
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:59,198
botanic garden world of thousands of

2511
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,279
institutions connected with gene banks

2512
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:03,359
around the world to try to to do

2513
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:05,519
something um about crop relatives but

2514
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:06,960
also about all these wild food plants

2515
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,400
that are increasingly threatened around

2516
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,800
the world etc. And so okay so now

2517
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:15,759
finally I get to this expansion. I have

2518
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,760
three more slides and um I think I have

2519
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,280
enough time to express them. I'm going

2520
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,360
to take a deep breath for a minute and

2521
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:24,359
try to give you one one last big

2522
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:24,359
thought.

2523
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:32,320
Um, this is such a great

2524
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:34,719
institution and so many amazing brains

2525
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,158
and creativity here, so much

2526
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,520
productivity. I really agree with the

2527
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:39,198
previous speakers that spoke about how

2528
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,360
what an amazing place this is and I'm

2529
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:46,000
really honored to be here.

2530
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:47,839
um taking care of our major crops I

2531
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,560
think in the title of the symposium as

2532
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,400
well relatives of our major crops is of

2533
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,280
utmost importance in terms of those

2534
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,118
crops future we have to keep this

2535
01:39:55,279 --> 01:40:00,880
diversification process going on are

2536
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:02,639
bringing in new new genetics that said

2537
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,400
my own feeling is that that's just the

2538
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,319
beginning of what agriculture can look

2539
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,799
like with these wild plants or semi-

2540
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:10,799
wild plants don't even use the word wild

2541
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:14,480
these plants

2542
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:16,360
uh and So, anybody know what this plant

2543
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:19,759
is by

2544
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:23,118
chance? Please. It is a ground nut.

2545
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,440
American ground nut. So, this is aios

2546
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:28,158
aios

2547
01:40:24,439 --> 01:40:30,399
americana. This is a plant that um that

2548
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:33,279
was incredibly important in Native

2549
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:36,238
American food systems. Could say

2550
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:38,960
agriculture if you'd like. Um all the

2551
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:41,198
way from St. Louis to Cape Cod at one

2552
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:43,359
point and is kind of barely around

2553
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:47,279
anymore, mostly by hobbyists. There is a

2554
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:49,439
USDA collection in Iowa. Um, this is

2555
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:50,840
known to be really associated with

2556
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,118
people because it's a

2557
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:54,800
triploid. It has a native distribution

2558
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:56,559
as a diploid, a fertile diploid, but

2559
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,000
these triploids are what are were

2560
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,719
occurring all the way from St. Louis to

2561
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,880
Cape Cod with bigger tubers. It's a

2562
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:06,480
legume tuber, high protein, higher

2563
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,800
protein. It's tasty. This is my own

2564
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,158
actually um harvest in Colorado which is

2565
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,639
kind of marginal to collect it there

2566
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:14,960
which I fed during Thanksgiving to my

2567
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,920
family. Um it was known to be probably

2568
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:20,079
one of those foods eaten in the first

2569
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:24,319
Thanksgivings and um of course my family

2570
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:27,439
had you no idea what how there was like

2571
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,960
teaspoon each that they got to eat. Um

2572
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:30,879
but I thought it was pretty darn good.

2573
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,118
It's an amazing plant and it's just one

2574
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,800
of these plants that I want to I want to

2575
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,319
express for those that have the

2576
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,600
opportunity and privilege to think

2577
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:41,439
outside the box uh about new crops. This

2578
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,079
is one of these crops that really could

2579
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:47,279
be something. And um there's an

2580
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:49,760
association in the world with tuber

2581
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,880
um people who are predominantly

2582
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,000
dependent on tubers and protein

2583
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,079
deficiency. And so a crop like this

2584
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,719
could also be an incredible crop uh for

2585
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:00,800
other regions in the world.

2586
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,319
Just wanted to mention two other

2587
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,039
examples that I think are really neat

2588
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:07,519
that are coming along that are not so

2589
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:10,880
much about bringing genes over but uh

2590
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:14,000
thinking about bringing entire plants

2591
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,159
into food systems or or or um our

2592
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,359
agricultural systems. And this is work

2593
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:21,439
by my colleague Dr. Nolan Kaine and and

2594
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:23,920
colleagues in University of Colorado

2595
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:27,678
also USDA and other places. And this is

2596
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,840
a this is a native flax that you can see

2597
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,760
in its native distribution in that that

2598
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,560
map on that side widely distributed.

2599
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,000
It's a perennial. And so this is work

2600
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,800
that was also referred to a little bit

2601
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,600
in an earlier presentation um around the

2602
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,239
promise or opportunities of perennial

2603
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:46,239
crops and um in in in more sustainable

2604
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:48,638
agricultural systems. This is a pretty

2605
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,718
neat one. it it it already has good oil

2606
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:52,960
content like the domesticated flax that

2607
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,960
is mostly grown and it's already in

2608
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,118
wildflower mixes so we kind of know how

2609
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,880
to grow it already. It's really just

2610
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,719
figuring out the agonomic systems and

2611
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:05,359
bumping up the quality and and um and

2612
01:43:01,719 --> 01:43:06,639
and yeah the quality essentially and so

2613
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:08,319
there is some really great work like

2614
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,400
this going on and I'm happy to talk more

2615
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:15,000
about it to those who who want to talk

2616
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:19,439
more about that stuff. And so as a last

2617
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:22,319
slide, so here's a question that um my

2618
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:24,479
mentor and my postto Dr. Allison Miller

2619
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:27,920
from the Danforest Center in St. Louis

2620
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:30,919
University in St. Lewis asks which are

2621
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:35,440
the wild relatives of our future

2622
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:37,600
crops and her argument which I agree is

2623
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:40,960
they are certainly the wild relatives of

2624
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:44,560
wheat and rice and maize and tomato and

2625
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:47,319
brassica the canola and all of that but

2626
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,239
if our future crops are also other

2627
01:43:47,319 --> 01:43:51,920
things then um then our wild relatives

2628
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:54,799
are also other things too. they can go

2629
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:57,199
much beyond. And so there is some really

2630
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,360
excellent and interesting work about

2631
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:00,678
trying to figure

2632
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:03,439
out for instance if you want to go

2633
01:44:00,679 --> 01:44:06,319
perennial, how many herbaceous

2634
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:08,559
perennials in this case um the land

2635
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,719
institute type thinking on productive

2636
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,719
perennial systems that you could mow and

2637
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:15,118
things like that. How many are there out

2638
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:18,800
there in the world? And so in terms of

2639
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:20,880
grasses, in fact, there's almost 8,000

2640
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,119
perennial or baceous grasses that could

2641
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,600
be looked at. And then how do we whittle

2642
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:27,679
that down to 20 or 30 or 50 or a couple

2643
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:30,560
hundred that might really be promising

2644
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:32,319
next step crops for the future? I'm so

2645
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,119
inspired by this because this is the

2646
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:37,679
kind of long-term, you know, big picture

2647
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:40,479
thinking that maybe 500 years from now,

2648
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,399
we end up with 20 or 30 or a couple

2649
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:43,839
hundred different crops that we're

2650
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:47,118
eating. and and how exciting and

2651
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,960
interesting that would be. So, I hope

2652
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:52,319
this was um interesting and uh and I

2653
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,560
hope that it just drove home just a

2654
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,439
little bit how important the

2655
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:58,000
foundational bigger thinking and

2656
01:44:55,439 --> 01:45:00,638
conservation work is to plant breeding.

2657
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,118
Lots of links to these websites and data

2658
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:04,880
resources and and papers at the end over

2659
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:07,759
the years. So, thank you so much. Happy

2660
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,920
to answer questions.

2661
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,600
Yes, thank you so much for the

2662
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:15,920
presentation. Um, I was wondering if you

2663
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,400
had any knowledge of our interest in

2664
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:21,399
crops being domesticated by nonhuman

2665
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:21,399
animals.

2666
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:27,118
Um, so and and how if you don't mind me

2667
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:32,118
asking, how do you define a crop in that

2668
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:32,118
case then? Oh no,

2669
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,719
that's a good question because I think I

2670
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:41,879
probably

2671
01:45:37,719 --> 01:45:45,039
put in the definition. Yeah. Or say that

2672
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:49,359
it's a plant that's been used widely by

2673
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:50,960
humans and has diverged from a wild

2674
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:52,559
relative, but I guess you could say the

2675
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,239
same.

2676
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,840
Yeah. Well, I'll try to answer your

2677
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:59,039
question in some helpful or meaningful

2678
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,880
way. In any case, what what I well I

2679
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,079
don't have off the top of my head

2680
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,560
something that um yeah, I do actually. I

2681
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:10,479
have two answers.

2682
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:13,520
one thing is um humans are incredibly

2683
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:15,039
innovative. I mean obviously we're doing

2684
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,360
all kinds of crazy things like cell

2685
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:19,600
phones, right?

2686
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:21,439
Um, I still think probably the biggest

2687
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:23,639
most incredible innovation that's ever

2688
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:26,000
happened is agriculture

2689
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:28,880
itself, which is this huge process of

2690
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,560
just of of noticing what's around and

2691
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,159
then working with that diversity and

2692
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,719
changing it in this co-evolutionary

2693
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:37,519
process where everybody needs everybody,

2694
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:40,719
humans need the plants or animals, etc.

2695
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:43,199
But we didn't, it wasn't just us. And in

2696
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:44,800
fact, we capitalized on other animals

2697
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,039
quite a lot in some cases, particularly

2698
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,440
with fruit. And so avocados, for

2699
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:52,719
instance, didn't actually go from this

2700
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:54,879
to that like maze did. Uh avocados

2701
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,960
actually went from this to that because

2702
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:00,239
they were already being eaten by and

2703
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:03,039
selected by megapana in this case in the

2704
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:05,279
past. And so I think maybe that's um

2705
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:06,960
that's that's some something that gets

2706
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:08,158
to your question. But the other thing I

2707
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,960
want to say that's also really important

2708
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:13,039
is as as many of you probably know, the

2709
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,800
more we know about plant systems,

2710
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:16,158
especially plant systems and and what

2711
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,560
we're hoping is more sustainable

2712
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:20,559
agricultural systems that have living

2713
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,159
soils and such, the more we realize that

2714
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,560
the cropping systems are actually very

2715
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:27,118
complex with microbiota, um, with

2716
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,960
pollinators, including things like bats

2717
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:30,719
for agave and things like that. And if

2718
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,560
if those things aren't all still

2719
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:35,600
working, then you really don't have your

2720
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,199
plant system. That in cases like agave

2721
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,119
are sometimes a little bit

2722
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:41,678
contentiously, I know, but not even

2723
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:43,519
called plants anymore. But holions, that

2724
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,880
means that that that that there's so

2725
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,119
many organisms that have to work

2726
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,719
together that if if you just have the

2727
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:50,719
plant, it's really not the thing

2728
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:52,239
anymore. It's not the crop. You need you

2729
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,319
need all the microorganisms and you need

2730
01:47:52,238 --> 01:47:57,198
the pollinators, you need the people,

2731
01:47:54,319 --> 01:48:01,439
the whole shebang.

2732
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:04,000
Cool. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

2733
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:06,000
Yes. So, so in my mind, and I haven't

2734
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,840
researched this rec so I could be wrong,

2735
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,399
but I feel like a lot of the threats to

2736
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,719
um conservation and natural diversity

2737
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:15,519
are driven by capitalist market forces.

2738
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:17,679
Um and I always thought that it's kind

2739
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,119
of hard to quantify in the language

2740
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,399
those forces are conversant in

2741
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:23,519
economics. um like the value of

2742
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:25,759
biodiversity that people are really like

2743
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,679
deeply steeped in plants and agriculture

2744
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,679
wilderness that value is kind of

2745
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:31,440
inherent maybe in our perspective but

2746
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:33,199
now that you like seem to have this very

2747
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:35,678
high level picture of genetic diversity

2748
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:37,678
in these crop oil species like across

2749
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,199
America kind of across the world and

2750
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:40,960
we're also developing a pretty like

2751
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:42,799
clear understanding the impact that

2752
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:45,359
diversity can have on our agricultural

2753
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:48,000
system. Do you feel like there could be

2754
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,679
kind of a quantification of the like

2755
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
potential economic value of genetic

2756
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,399
diversity in these crop wild species?

2757
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,319
Um, and would that quantification be

2758
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:58,719
like a useful argument for conservation

2759
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:00,439
efforts if it could be made? Cool.

2760
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:04,079
Great.

2761
01:49:00,439 --> 01:49:08,559
Um I I know that there have been for 30

2762
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:12,238
years um economic valuations of genetic

2763
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:16,159
resources including crop relatives and

2764
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:18,158
um there's a there was a among research

2765
01:49:16,158 --> 01:49:20,638
groups there's a a person named Melinda

2766
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:22,719
Smail who I think had some associations

2767
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,960
with Cornell in fact and some other

2768
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:27,039
places and she did some preliminary work

2769
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,960
as well as a group in USDA the economic

2770
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:30,479
research service. So you can look up

2771
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,279
some of that early stuff. It's pretty

2772
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:37,039
wild. In some cases, the valuations are

2773
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:39,920
specific to um to genetic innovations

2774
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:43,279
and they're always in the millions um if

2775
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:45,520
not billions of dollars. And so if you

2776
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:49,679
the economic arguments I think have have

2777
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:51,520
been there um to do one for the whole

2778
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,880
like what is the value of wild relatives

2779
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,800
economically? I don't think anybody's

2780
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,639
come up with the single number and of

2781
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,560
course it's a crazy thing to even

2782
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,840
attempt but if there are any economists

2783
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,600
in the crowd that want to give it a try

2784
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:05,920
it'd be incredible to to hear

2785
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:08,239
that I don't know you know I'm not

2786
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,760
placed to say as as a economist or

2787
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:12,319
policy person or anything which none of

2788
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:14,560
those how effective those arguments are

2789
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,479
but I I I do think that money talks to

2790
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,199
some degree and we should still be

2791
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:22,158
speaking in those languages um to to

2792
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:26,279
drive home the ever important message

2793
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:26,279
that we need genetic resources.

2794
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:31,600
Thank you.

2795
01:50:29,079 --> 01:50:33,840
Sorry. I think we need to move on to the

2796
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:39,000
next speaker time wise, but yeah,

2797
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:39,000
definitely fine. Thanks so much.

2798
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:43,039
Thank you, Henry, for the kind

2799
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,719
introduction. I want to thank the

2800
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:46,079
symposium organizing committee for all

2801
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:49,279
their hard work in putting this event

2802
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:51,600
together, as well as to the to Corteva

2803
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:53,439
for sponsoring the event. I'm really

2804
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:56,239
excited to be here today to share some

2805
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:58,158
pieces of my PhD research with you which

2806
01:50:56,238 --> 01:50:59,839
is focused on maintaining diversity

2807
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:01,719
within the Kansas State University wheat

2808
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,000
breeding

2809
01:51:01,719 --> 01:51:06,158
program. So when we think about wheat

2810
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,719
performance over time, we have seen

2811
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:11,920
sustained genetic gain in terms of wheat

2812
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:14,319
yields. Specifically around the adoption

2813
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:18,239
of green revolution varieties in the

2814
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:21,039
1970s and 1980s, we see a significant

2815
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:23,678
spike in our wheat yield increases.

2816
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:26,039
However, this genetic gain for yield,

2817
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:28,719
while is still increasing, is

2818
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:30,639
decelerating to where this might suggest

2819
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:33,039
a potential plateau and improvement in

2820
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:35,600
wheat yields. And at any point when we

2821
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:37,039
start to lose um improvement for a

2822
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,560
certain trait, it can become very

2823
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:40,479
prudent to go back and look at those

2824
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:43,199
more diverse sources or wild relatives

2825
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:43,198
to be used in

2826
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:47,439
breeding. When thinking about what makes

2827
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:49,760
up the overall wheat yield, we can think

2828
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:52,399
of it as a trade-off between our source

2829
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,679
traits and our sync traits. So our

2830
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:55,039
source traits are going to be those

2831
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:57,359
traits that are more important in the

2832
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:58,639
early stage of the growing season. Um

2833
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:00,960
development of adequate levels of

2834
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,440
biomass will determine photosynthetic

2835
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:05,880
efficiency and eventual um

2836
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:08,238
transllocation to the sink filling

2837
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:11,118
organs which are on the right side of

2838
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:14,799
the triangle. The sink filling organs

2839
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:17,198
are going to be more important um during

2840
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,800
scinessence and grain filling period to

2841
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,960
where these are the ones that have been

2842
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,199
historically prioritized the most in

2843
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:25,840
increasing wheat yields. Most of our

2844
01:52:23,198 --> 01:52:28,000
increases in wheat yield over time has

2845
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,279
come because of increases to harvest

2846
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,719
index which is shown in this bipot

2847
01:52:30,279 --> 01:52:34,319
analysis where grain yield and harvest

2848
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:37,840
index have the highest amount of

2849
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:39,920
co-variation compared to these other um

2850
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,960
yield components.

2851
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,639
So in thinking that all of our mo many

2852
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,880
of our improvements yielded have come

2853
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,880
because of harvest index. If we want to

2854
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,639
keep making improvements, we may need to

2855
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,960
start focusing more on this right side

2856
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:55,440
of the triangle in those source traits

2857
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,840
while keeping in the back of our minds

2858
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:00,000
that we have to make sure to optimize

2859
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,079
this trade-off. You have to have enough

2860
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,359
biomass to photosynthesize early in the

2861
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:05,039
season, but you also have to leave

2862
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:08,439
enough time to fill grain later on in

2863
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:08,439
the growing season.

2864
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:12,639
So in thinking about how we can do this

2865
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:15,279
in wheat specifically, wheat has a

2866
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:18,480
complicated genetic history in terms of

2867
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:20,800
its um evolution and domestication which

2868
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:24,319
provides several opportunities for crop

2869
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:27,360
wild wild relatives. I was very thankful

2870
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:29,679
for to Colin for introducing the onion

2871
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:32,479
concept of the primary, secondary, and

2872
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:35,760
tertiary gene pools. When thinking about

2873
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:37,198
wheat, the primary and secondary species

2874
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,079
that are in the gene pool are going to

2875
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:41,359
be those ones that have um genomes in

2876
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:44,000
common. So those are going to be the

2877
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:47,198
ones that are shown on this slide. So to

2878
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,840
go over just in detail the steps that

2879
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:51,399
occurred in generating our hexaploid

2880
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,000
wheat or tric

2881
01:53:51,399 --> 01:53:55,679
acum. The first species that were

2882
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,840
involved were the wild grass species

2883
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:00,239
which donated the A and B genomes to

2884
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,560
formed tetroploid tricum turgidum

2885
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:05,559
subspecies daoidis which is also known

2886
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:08,639
as wild emmer. Further

2887
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:11,280
domestication rose made a cultivated

2888
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:13,440
emmer or triticum turgidum subspecies

2889
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,000
dicum come about. After the free

2890
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:18,000
threshing character was conferred durham

2891
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,158
wheat arose. This is what is used in our

2892
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,399
pasta production. These free threshing

2893
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:25,198
tetroploids were also the tetroploid

2894
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:26,839
donor for um breadwheat which when

2895
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:29,238
hybridized with the dgome donor

2896
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:32,560
adelopsia formed hexaploid

2897
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:34,319
trum. Some things to notice about uh the

2898
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,320
evolutionary history of wheat is that

2899
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:37,719
there were two hybridization events each

2900
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:41,519
associated with their own genetic

2901
01:54:37,719 --> 01:54:43,279
bottleneck. Because of the um makeup of

2902
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,360
the wheat genome, there have been many

2903
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:46,639
opportunities to lose out on genetic

2904
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:48,719
diversity coming from these wild

2905
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:51,440
relatives. The other thing I want to

2906
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,840
point out is that this species wild

2907
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:55,839
emmer specifically is can be considered

2908
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:59,360
the central conduit of gene flow between

2909
01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:02,960
the wild um diploid species and our

2910
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:02,960
cultivated durham and

2911
01:55:04,599 --> 01:55:09,840
breadweeds. So there are several main

2912
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:11,280
approaches to gene ingression. A very

2913
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,679
straightforward approach approach would

2914
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:15,759
just be through making direct crosses.

2915
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:18,239
This will be limited to species within

2916
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:20,400
the primary and secondary gene pools to

2917
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:22,399
where myotic re combination will not be

2918
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,879
very successful if the chromosomes can't

2919
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:26,559
even pair in the first place. Synthetic

2920
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:28,319
wheat is another approach that's taken

2921
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:31,360
specifically in wheat breeding. This is

2922
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:33,198
where a cross between a tetroploid

2923
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:35,598
Durham or other tetroploid wheat is made

2924
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:37,919
to that Dgome donor. This basically

2925
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:40,480
regenerates that initial cross that

2926
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,639
resulted in hexaploid wheat. However, a

2927
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:44,879
drawback of using this approach is that

2928
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:47,118
you're essentially discarding many

2929
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,599
generations of breeding progress that

2930
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,679
has made in hexaploid wheat. So, these

2931
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:53,000
materials aren't generally very um

2932
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:56,000
adopted

2933
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,198
agonomically. Gene editing also has its

2934
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,560
um place in gene in introgression

2935
01:55:58,198 --> 01:56:03,839
breeding. This this is really specific

2936
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,280
for precise edits. Um when thinking

2937
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,279
about just increasing overall

2938
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:08,880
quantitative variation, it can be a

2939
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:10,719
little more challenging. And it's also

2940
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,319
important to think about any sort of

2941
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,079
regulatory constraints that come along

2942
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:16,599
with that process, especially in the US

2943
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:19,279
and in um working with wheat germ

2944
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:20,880
plasm. Amphiploid hybrids are a really

2945
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:22,719
interesting approach that can be taken.

2946
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,199
This allows for crossing between two

2947
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:26,960
relatively unrelated species because

2948
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:29,598
when that cross is done, artificial

2949
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,279
chromosome doubling is performed. That

2950
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:33,039
way the complete chromosomeal

2951
01:56:31,279 --> 01:56:34,479
constitution of each of the two species

2952
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:37,479
that were used in that cross is

2953
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:37,479
maintained.

2954
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:41,599
So the amphopid hybrid approach was what

2955
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:44,159
was used in development of my PhD

2956
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:46,319
research population. So I know this is a

2957
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:48,559
lot but just go step by step with me.

2958
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:50,479
The first step was through crossing the

2959
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:54,480
hexaploid recurrent parentred wheat

2960
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:56,479
donor to the age lobst genome donor. A

2961
01:56:54,479 --> 01:56:59,799
cross between these two species does not

2962
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:02,399
have much um match in terms of its

2963
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:05,039
chromosomes which is why we had to

2964
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:06,960
double the chromosomes with ultraine.

2965
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:09,039
This resulted in development of a

2966
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,000
synthetic octoploid where we have the

2967
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:13,800
full genomic makeup of acce and the full

2968
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,079
genomic makeup of

2969
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:18,000
agelopia. In this way this synthetic

2970
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:20,399
octoploid is used as an amphiploid

2971
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,679
bridge to bring in the diversity coming

2972
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:25,198
from wild emmer or triticum

2973
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:27,920
dyquoides. So that second step was

2974
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:30,519
through was using this um amphiploid

2975
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:33,760
bridge with a cross to

2976
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:36,400
dyoid. After that, the hexaploids are

2977
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,239
able to be regained. Something that's

2978
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:39,839
important to notice is that in this F1

2979
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:43,279
generation, we still have a really high

2980
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:46,239
contribution of theoretical um wild

2981
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:48,238
alals in our background. So to regain

2982
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:50,959
that background recurrent parent, two

2983
01:57:48,238 --> 01:57:53,359
back crosses were made to uh the same

2984
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,760
hexapoid recurrent parent to where after

2985
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:58,399
the first bat cross, the proportion the

2986
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:00,719
theoretical proportion of wild alles

2987
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:04,238
would be around 30%. After the second

2988
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:05,920
that's reduced down to around 15%. So

2989
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:07,839
essentially this population is developed

2990
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,359
to have a very high proportion of that

2991
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,920
recurrent parent background in it to

2992
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:14,719
maintain adequate levels of um yield and

2993
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:17,520
regional adaptation while still keeping

2994
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:20,480
low-level uh contributions from those

2995
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,239
wild relatives. But it's also important

2996
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:24,238
that we keep those integrations at a

2997
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:25,759
high enough frequency to where we can

2998
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:28,759
actually pick up on any meaningful

2999
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,760
variation.

3000
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:35,118
So after these um F4 derived F5 lines

3001
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:38,479
were increased, we were able to do a ton

3002
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:40,000
of phenotypic triing across Kansas. We

3003
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:41,799
used three years, three locations

3004
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,560
distributed across the precipitation

3005
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,239
gradient. However, it's um interesting

3006
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,400
that in the three years that we did this

3007
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:50,079
study in, all of Kansas was under a

3008
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:51,598
pretty severe drought. So the

3009
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:53,599
differences that we might observe

3010
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:55,520
between these locations in a year with

3011
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:58,480
adequate precipitation were not

3012
01:58:55,520 --> 01:59:00,320
necessarily observed in my data.

3013
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:02,000
The largest piece of my project was

3014
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:04,639
collecting this massive quantity of

3015
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,399
phenotypic data. I'll go over each of

3016
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,880
these components. In the next several

3017
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:11,839
slides, but the goal was essentially to

3018
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:14,239
look at the trait means and variances of

3019
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,960
those wild integration lines compared to

3020
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:21,238
common check varieties that are used as

3021
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,239
benchmarks of regional performance.

3022
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:26,639
So before I talk more about each of

3023
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,199
those um trait groups, I wanted to

3024
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,960
discuss my data processing. So this is

3025
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:35,118
essentially a zoomed in view on two of

3026
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:37,960
those 279 integression lines. What is

3027
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:40,479
shown here are my raw observational data

3028
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:42,158
Y for three traits in essence state,

3029
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:43,839
plant height, and grain yield. What you

3030
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:46,479
might notice is that these traits have

3031
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:48,400
very different magnitudes of variance to

3032
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:50,638
where making efficient comparisons

3033
01:59:48,399 --> 01:59:52,960
between them can be really challenging

3034
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,039
um especially when considering deviation

3035
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,520
between

3036
01:59:54,039 --> 01:59:59,439
them. So that's why I pursued a data

3037
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,199
standardization approach. This is a

3038
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:04,079
fairly straightforward methodology to

3039
02:00:01,198 --> 02:00:06,559
where within each location I took the

3040
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:09,359
within environment trait mean subtracted

3041
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:11,320
it from the raw data and divided by the

3042
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:13,439
within environment standard

3043
02:00:11,319 --> 02:00:16,000
deviation. After doing this

3044
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:18,319
standardization process, we are left

3045
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,960
with an a data set that is quite more

3046
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:23,198
easily interpretable to where the mean

3047
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,039
is going to be at zero, which means

3048
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:26,719
anything with a positive value is going

3049
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:28,319
to be above the mean. Anything with a

3050
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:30,399
negative value will be below the mean.

3051
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:32,679
This just becomes really easy way to

3052
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:35,439
view a lot of data at

3053
02:00:32,679 --> 02:00:38,000
once. These standardized data were used

3054
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:40,960
as the input for two-stage analysis. The

3055
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,520
first stage was uh modeling the within

3056
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:46,800
location genotype genotypic values as

3057
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:50,639
fixed effects and we did this by making

3058
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:52,320
a AR1 row column spatial correction.

3059
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:55,359
After running this model, we had our

3060
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:57,118
blues or genotypic estimates and our

3061
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:58,880
weights corresponding to each one of

3062
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:01,198
those values which were used as the

3063
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,480
input into the next model in a two-stage

3064
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:07,598
analysis which is a bl. This is run

3065
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:09,519
across locations using genotype as a

3066
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:12,880
random effect to where we can extract

3067
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:15,599
one single genotypic value for each

3068
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,440
genotype across all locations. Doing

3069
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,319
this enables u much more efficient

3070
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:22,399
analysis because instead of doing single

3071
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:24,399
within environment analyses and trying

3072
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:26,559
to composite across them, this

3073
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:29,279
essentially does that for me. And to

3074
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,440
further verify that this approach um was

3075
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:34,399
a reasonable one, I looked at the

3076
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:38,079
genetic correlations of different traits

3077
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:41,039
and traits uh within environments.

3078
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:43,840
So the diagonal shown here or the matrix

3079
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:47,599
shown here has genetic correlation of

3080
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:49,199
grainy blues at the six locations tested

3081
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,199
with genetic repeatability on the

3082
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:52,719
diagonal. What can be noticed is that

3083
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:54,719
the high degree of correlation between

3084
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:56,439
these locations indicates that there

3085
02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:00,399
aren't very many rank changes in these

3086
02:01:56,439 --> 02:02:03,359
genotypes which allows me to make more

3087
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:05,279
um efficient comparisons just using

3088
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,359
those blops. I would expect my results

3089
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:11,039
to apply regardless of my

3090
02:02:08,359 --> 02:02:13,039
location. Looking at my trait blups in

3091
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:15,198
this matrix again with the genetic

3092
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:16,960
repeatabilities plotted on the diagonal.

3093
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,118
I specifically want to highlight the

3094
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,520
fact that these repeatability values are

3095
02:02:19,118 --> 02:02:23,839
moderately high to high which is not

3096
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,440
necessarily always expected for highly

3097
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:27,360
quantitative traits which is what I'm

3098
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:29,198
working with. Um, but the fact that

3099
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:31,359
those had high repeatability values

3100
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:33,439
indicates that using these blops is

3101
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:35,759
going to be an effective way to still

3102
02:02:33,439 --> 02:02:38,399
capture that effective variation while

3103
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,639
not having to necessarily do it within

3104
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:40,638
each

3105
02:02:41,399 --> 02:02:46,879
environment. So going into some of these

3106
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:49,118
um specific trait groups, one of the

3107
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:51,199
first um things I measured were some of

3108
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:52,799
my phenological characteristics. So

3109
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:56,158
heading dates, essence date, grainfill

3110
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:59,239
period and plant height. A pattern that

3111
02:02:56,158 --> 02:03:03,118
is interesting here to notice is

3112
02:02:59,238 --> 02:03:05,039
the divergence of the mean and standard

3113
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,960
deviation of the checks versus

3114
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:09,279
integration lines. So we have this

3115
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,800
orange bar corresponding to the checks

3116
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:12,719
and the purple corresponding to the

3117
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,920
integration lines with the mean centered

3118
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:18,079
at zero. And we see that these checks

3119
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,359
are on average developing quite a bit

3120
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:24,880
later compared to the ingression lines.

3121
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:27,279
And this can be localized to a region on

3122
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:28,880
chromosome 2B. And I apologize I didn't

3123
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:30,559
have time to talk too much about my

3124
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,639
marker data, but I did want to show some

3125
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:35,119
of my G-W was results just so you guys

3126
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:37,279
can see um that we are still able to

3127
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:39,679
pick up variation coming from these wild

3128
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,840
alals even though they're at very low

3129
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:44,960
minor al frequencies which is shown in

3130
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:44,960
this table here.

3131
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:51,440
Moving on to yield components. Something

3132
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,279
that is important when thinking about

3133
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:54,799
working with wild material is the fact

3134
02:03:53,279 --> 02:03:57,439
that we're going to see pretty

3135
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:59,440
significant yield drag. So these are

3136
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:01,359
showing grain yield for the checks for

3137
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:03,759
the integression lines. We see that

3138
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:05,198
those checks are having a much higher

3139
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:06,960
level of yield compared to those

3140
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:09,439
integration lines. Although that pattern

3141
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:13,840
doesn't necessarily follow off of um

3142
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:16,399
throughout all of our different traits.

3143
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:19,679
So focusing first on our traits that are

3144
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:21,519
related to the source stage of the yield

3145
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:23,359
triangle, we saw quite a bit of

3146
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:25,760
variation to where I got some fairly

3147
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:27,519
strong peaks across all these traits.

3148
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,000
And a specific thing I want to point out

3149
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:33,199
here is that for my green reflectance

3150
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:36,479
values, I got that same um peak on

3151
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:38,960
chromosome 2B. This is fairly intuitive

3152
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:42,158
however because previously when I was

3153
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,480
that peak was associated with um

3154
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:47,279
maturity and development to where

3155
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:49,279
something that is uh scessing is losing

3156
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,118
its green chlorophyll content and so

3157
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:52,880
when you average that green reflectance

3158
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:54,880
throughout the growing season things

3159
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:57,118
with lower values are probably going to

3160
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:59,800
be the ones that matured faster anyway.

3161
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:05,399
So, so far making sense

3162
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:08,560
still. Moving on to the um sink related

3163
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:10,879
traits. We see that there were was a

3164
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:13,119
common association for several of these

3165
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,520
grain size traits. So, thousand kernel

3166
02:05:13,118 --> 02:05:17,759
weight, test weight, and kernel width.

3167
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:20,080
Specifically, that association for test

3168
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,800
weight, which is essentially how um

3169
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:25,439
effectively your grain can pack into a

3170
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,599
certain volume. that has a fairly large

3171
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:30,158
effect and fairly large percent variance

3172
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:32,800
explained to where the fact that this

3173
02:05:30,158 --> 02:05:35,039
region came up for multiple uh grain

3174
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,599
size traits indicates that this may have

3175
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:40,800
a fairly large effect on the yield drag

3176
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:40,800
that is observed in these

3177
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:45,840
materials. While we see a drag for

3178
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:48,079
yield, the opposite effect is generally

3179
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:50,319
observed for our quality traits. One of

3180
02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:51,920
the reasons people use uh wild emmer

3181
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:54,799
specifically in wheat breeding programs

3182
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:58,000
is because of its quality. When thinking

3183
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:59,920
about our grain protein content, we see

3184
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,439
that these checks have an average of

3185
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,520
much lower compared to the wild

3186
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:06,000
integration

3187
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:08,080
lines. However, grain protein and grain

3188
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,679
yield and wheat have a very strongly

3189
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:11,679
negative relationship to where it can be

3190
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:13,520
challenging to select on both of these

3191
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,440
things. And if you you're going to pick

3192
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:17,040
one, then you're going to pick yield. So

3193
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:19,118
this is where breeders use a metric

3194
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:20,639
called grain protein deviation which is

3195
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:22,719
essentially a regression of protein

3196
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,760
content on grain yield using the

3197
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:28,079
residuals from that um regression as the

3198
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:30,560
protein deviation values. This can be

3199
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:32,000
used in a way to where a cutoff

3200
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,880
threshold for grain yield can be

3201
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,880
established and then um lines with

3202
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:39,319
higher than average grain protein can be

3203
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:42,480
selected which is shown in this green

3204
02:06:39,319 --> 02:06:44,078
box. And so looking at the um

3205
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:45,839
distribution of grain protein deviation

3206
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:48,078
in my population which essentially

3207
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,920
combines the protein and yield, we see

3208
02:06:48,078 --> 02:06:52,078
that those checks and the recurrent

3209
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:54,399
parent all kind of cluster at the lower

3210
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:56,719
end of that distribution. So these

3211
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:58,960
integration lines have higher grain

3212
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:01,279
protein deviation overall. But one thing

3213
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,039
that is interesting to notice is that

3214
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:05,840
for protein quality score and solvent

3215
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:07,880
retention capacity which while grain

3216
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:10,480
protein is more a measure of protein

3217
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:12,560
content these are a measure of protein

3218
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,238
quality those do not necessarily

3219
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:16,719
increase. So while we've brought an

3220
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:18,799
increase in protein content over from

3221
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:20,480
this these wild relative integrations we

3222
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,360
did not necessarily increase the

3223
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:23,359
functional protein

3224
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:29,599
quality. So, I also screened some of

3225
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:31,840
these um through a full ionomics panel

3226
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:33,599
of 19 elements. I didn't include these

3227
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,119
on the previous correlation matrix just

3228
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:37,360
because it would have been incredibly

3229
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:39,439
massive to look at, but I showed these

3230
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:41,598
here also including grain yield and

3231
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:43,519
grain protein. Something to point out is

3232
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:45,760
the generally negative correlations

3233
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:48,560
between grain yield and these ionomics

3234
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:50,960
traits. Meaning that selection for

3235
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:53,520
increasing concentration of desirable

3236
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:55,920
elements in the grain may very likely

3237
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,280
reduce our grain yield levels. And

3238
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,359
additionally, when looking at these

3239
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:00,399
genetic

3240
02:07:58,359 --> 02:08:02,078
repeatabilities, those low genetic

3241
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:03,598
repeatabilities indicate that there's a

3242
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:05,840
lot of environmental variation that's

3243
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,279
going to have an effect. And so the

3244
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:10,319
efficiency of selection won't be that

3245
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:12,238
high anyway. So these ionomics data are

3246
02:08:10,319 --> 02:08:13,519
a little bit messy in terms of how we

3247
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:16,319
can use them for breeding but

3248
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:19,800
nonetheless I was able to actually find

3249
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:23,279
an interesting um pathway which can be

3250
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:27,520
pursued to where for rubidium which is

3251
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:29,920
shown here I got that same

3252
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:34,079
um peak on the same region of chromosome

3253
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:37,599
2b. So rubidium is generally used as a

3254
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:40,880
proxy for potassium transport and which

3255
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:42,719
is going to be water transport. So when

3256
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,359
you see variations in your rubidium

3257
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:48,639
concentrations that are localized to the

3258
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:51,439
same regions as your um development that

3259
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:53,118
can really be indicative of some sort of

3260
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:54,799
a drought related effect especially

3261
02:08:53,118 --> 02:08:56,439
given the fact that these were these

3262
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,719
data were all collected under drought

3263
02:08:56,439 --> 02:09:00,399
conditions. So, it's going to be

3264
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:02,800
interesting to look more at this region

3265
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:04,078
on chromosome 2b in greater detail under

3266
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,239
more controlled drought environments

3267
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,158
instead of just the randomly natural

3268
02:09:06,238 --> 02:09:09,718
drought that uh my experiment was

3269
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:12,638
conducted

3270
02:09:09,719 --> 02:09:15,520
under. So, I've shown you guys a bunch

3271
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:17,118
of data. Sometimes my ingression lines

3272
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,520
did better. Sometimes my checks did

3273
02:09:17,118 --> 02:09:20,880
better. A question that comes up is how

3274
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:24,159
on earth are we going to use all this

3275
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:27,440
data? So, this is where index selection

3276
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:29,598
becomes um really interesting. And

3277
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:30,799
because I am in an applied breeding

3278
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:32,319
program, I'm still going to always be

3279
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:34,320
the most interested in grain yield,

3280
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:36,960
which is why I developed this selection

3281
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:38,880
index specifically to always pick the

3282
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:40,560
highest yielding things. So, the way I

3283
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,960
did this, and just a reminder that these

3284
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:46,560
are standardized blops I'm working with,

3285
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:49,039
I multiplied the um blop of grain yield

3286
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,400
for a specific genotype by the blop of

3287
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:53,359
another trait. So in this case,

3288
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:55,279
grainfill period. I selected a subset of

3289
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:57,198
traits that I thought captured um what

3290
02:09:55,279 --> 02:10:00,238
breeders are generally selecting on. So

3291
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:02,479
grainfill period, high yielding but low

3292
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:05,678
um short plants. That's why I divided by

3293
02:10:02,479 --> 02:10:07,519
plant height here. Um I I had my

3294
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:10,319
protein, my solvent retention capacity,

3295
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,719
some of my kernel traits. And after

3296
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:15,840
doing these individual granular by trait

3297
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:18,719
indices, I was able to average across

3298
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:21,360
them to come up with an overall index

3299
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:23,520
for all of these lines. This index

3300
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:24,960
pulled out a couple integression lines

3301
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,199
that outperformed absolutely everything

3302
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:30,599
in the population, including the highest

3303
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:33,839
performing check, which is bolded to

3304
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:35,840
showdown. And I have this plotted next

3305
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,159
to grain yield in bushels per acre for

3306
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,800
comparison. And you can see that while

3307
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:42,559
this selection index is pulling out the

3308
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,400
things that are best across a wide range

3309
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,599
of traits, it is specifically also

3310
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:47,679
pulling out the things that are the

3311
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:49,279
highest yielding, which is going to be

3312
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:51,118
incredibly important when thinking about

3313
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:53,359
developing breeding materials. We

3314
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:55,118
weren't necessarily trying to develop um

3315
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:56,559
germ plasm to release. We were more

3316
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:58,238
thinking about developing parents for

3317
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:59,920
our crossing block, which these

3318
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:03,359
materials are already being recycled in

3319
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:07,039
our crossing block um this year. And

3320
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:08,880
additionally, these top three, so those

3321
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:11,279
three are being pursued for germ plasm

3322
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:14,400
release later this year. So this was a

3323
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:17,039
really um positive result out of my

3324
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:19,920
project because we weren't necessarily

3325
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:21,840
expecting that yield and adaptation to

3326
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,920
come through from that recurrent parent.

3327
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,760
So overall, some of the most in

3328
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:28,399
interesting things that I found out of

3329
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,039
my project is that using that amphoploid

3330
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:33,598
hybrid bridge approach was pretty

3331
02:11:31,039 --> 02:11:36,479
effective at bringing in diversity on

3332
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:38,719
all three genomes at a level that was

3333
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:40,959
able to be detected by my different

3334
02:11:38,719 --> 02:11:42,800
analyses while still maintaining that

3335
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,639
recurrent parent background. These

3336
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:47,760
things are still very well adapted to

3337
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:50,400
Kansas um even in spite of the drought

3338
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,840
conditions that that was experienced.

3339
02:11:50,399 --> 02:11:53,198
Additionally, there are several

3340
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:55,279
interesting routes that can be pursued

3341
02:11:53,198 --> 02:11:57,519
further. I think that region on

3342
02:11:55,279 --> 02:12:00,319
chromosome 2B could be really studied in

3343
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:02,239
a lot of detail. Also, the re the region

3344
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:04,319
on 6B, I think that would be really

3345
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:06,158
interesting to look at in terms of um

3346
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:08,840
reducing that linkage drag that comes

3347
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:11,118
from wild in

3348
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:12,560
regressions. So, with that, I just want

3349
02:12:11,118 --> 02:12:15,359
to make sure that nobody thinks that I

3350
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:17,280
did this all on my own. Um I have to

3351
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:19,519
give the biggest of thanks to the K8

3352
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:21,039
weep breeding program. They've supported

3353
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,880
me through every single stage of my

3354
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:24,359
research. Additionally, my graduate

3355
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:26,400
committee for all their intellectual

3356
02:12:24,359 --> 02:12:28,799
contributions. I I was pretty stupid

3357
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:31,198
when I started, so they've helped me uh

3358
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,279
become slightly smarter. Also, my

3359
02:12:31,198 --> 02:12:34,719
mentors, they've been the people who

3360
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:36,238
have gone out of their way to make sure

3361
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:37,840
that I have had the one-on-one support

3362
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:40,479
I've needed at any given point in my

3363
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:43,440
research. And of course, my family and

3364
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:44,638
my funding sources. So, with that, not

3365
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:46,559
sure how much time we have left for

3366
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:48,840
questions, but you can find me during

3367
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:52,880
coffee. And thank

3368
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:55,520
you. Yeah, you can go first. Um, so you

3369
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:58,480
talked about how you're developing these

3370
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:01,360
reccominant red lines

3371
02:12:58,479 --> 02:13:05,839
and you had a certain estimated

3372
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:09,920
proportion from each of your species.

3373
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:13,078
And that's been Yes. However, did you

3374
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:16,639
see any

3375
02:13:13,078 --> 02:13:20,679
uh segregation distortion? That is a

3376
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:23,760
good question. So I did check for one

3377
02:13:20,679 --> 02:13:28,639
annuploids did not find any um because

3378
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:30,719
since these are DC2s that allows for um

3379
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:33,520
a lot of that background to be brought

3380
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:36,960
back in to where these were mostly the

3381
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:39,440
recurrent parent. Um we are doing I just

3382
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:41,599
got access to the deep sequencing data

3383
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:43,598
from my parents. So that's the last big

3384
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:45,840
piece of my project. And so I'll be

3385
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:47,679
doing integression mapping to like more

3386
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,679
finely delineate where those

3387
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,840
intergression regions occur so I can

3388
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,639
look more at that segregation

3389
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:56,159
distortion. Um I also expect those

3390
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:58,920
frequencies once I do that to not

3391
02:13:56,158 --> 02:14:01,359
necessarily match my mandelian

3392
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,118
expectations. Mandelian expectations do

3393
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:05,519
not necessarily apply when playing

3394
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:08,559
around employee levels super well. So

3395
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:10,800
these are approximate um estimations.

3396
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:12,560
Additionally, the there was some

3397
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,920
negative selection that we did against

3398
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:16,560
things that didn't thresh or that

3399
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:19,118
shattered before harvest. Um, so I might

3400
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:20,960
expect those to have a higher proportion

3401
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:23,039
of wild alals in them, which is why they

3402
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:25,279
were not adapted, and removing those

3403
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:26,960
would subsequently lower my overall al

3404
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:28,319
frequencies from those integressions.

3405
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,439
But if they can't run through the

3406
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:34,359
combine, then there's no point in

3407
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:34,359
evaluating them. Thank you.

3408
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:39,840
Um I was just curious uh you mentioned

3409
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:42,880
um the overall protein content and then

3410
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:45,440
the protein quality and I was curious

3411
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:47,840
what that meant like quality in terms of

3412
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:49,118
nutrition or what were you Yeah. So the

3413
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:51,279
question was about protein content

3414
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:53,439
versus protein quality. So we have a

3415
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:55,599
really breeders friendly low or high

3416
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:58,399
throughput assay for early generation

3417
02:14:55,599 --> 02:15:01,800
materials because it only requires five

3418
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:05,439
grams of seed and it's a lactic acid SDS

3419
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:07,840
SRC. So we basically add lactic acid and

3420
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:10,000
SDS and we can do the dry pellet weight,

3421
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,199
wet pellet weight and adjust that for

3422
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,840
moisture to look at our solvent

3423
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:16,638
retention capacity which gets at your um

3424
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:18,400
gluten strength. These are very well

3425
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:20,560
correlated to some of our lower

3426
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:22,279
throughput um bake analyses that are

3427
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:25,039
done on our very late generation

3428
02:15:22,279 --> 02:15:26,800
materials. Um and then off the solvent

3429
02:15:25,039 --> 02:15:28,880
retention capacity, if you divide that

3430
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:31,039
value by the protein content, that gives

3431
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:32,880
you an estimate of protein quality

3432
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:34,719
because something that has higher

3433
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:37,520
solvent retention capacity but lower

3434
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:39,760
protein has more functional protein.

3435
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,360
That makes sense. So yeah, it's a

3436
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:44,719
breeders assay that was specifically

3437
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:47,519
developed for wheat breeders. Thanks.

3438
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:50,319
Yes. Could you elaborate more on a

3439
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:53,119
ionomic section and you said you're

3440
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:56,519
using the rubium levels to infer drought

3441
02:15:53,118 --> 02:16:00,880
resistance is that

3442
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:04,159
so rubidium is has a pretty high or

3443
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:06,159
strong correlation to potassium which

3444
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:08,000
when you look at a the potassium

3445
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:09,598
concentration in the grain that's going

3446
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,479
to indicate that's going to be an

3447
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:16,319
indication of water movement throughout

3448
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:19,759
the plant and rubidia is used as a proxy

3449
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:21,840
for potassium transport u because the

3450
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:24,800
way that they are seen in these assays

3451
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:27,119
is relatively similar and I had to learn

3452
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,760
that from some little deep dive in the

3453
02:16:27,118 --> 02:16:31,839
literature did not necessarily know that

3454
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,760
um and so when we see things with

3455
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:35,920
elevated rubidium levels that can

3456
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:38,159
indicate that the plant is under more

3457
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:39,599
higher levels of drought stress because

3458
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:42,398
if there's more rubidium that means

3459
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:44,880
there's going to be more water transport

3460
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:47,279
and so that's kind of where we're going

3461
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:49,039
with this association right now. This

3462
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:52,719
will of course be better verified with

3463
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:54,880
my deep sequencing data and my uh and

3464
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:56,478
any other analyses that are done on this

3465
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:59,438
region. I don't know if that answered

3466
02:16:56,478 --> 02:17:01,358
your question. Perfect. I think I saw a

3467
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,120
hand over here. Oh yeah. So this is a

3468
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,159
bit more anecdotal and like maybe far

3469
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,160
out of the distribution of your

3470
02:17:04,159 --> 02:17:08,159
research, but I noticed um in some of my

3471
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:09,920
work that the I look at chloroplast and

3472
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:12,000
the chloroplast genome for a lot of

3473
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,679
species and centrum is like drastically

3474
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,040
shorter than others. So I was curious

3475
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:16,558
when you're doing your crossing, did you

3476
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:18,800
like observe anything weird happening

3477
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:22,318
based on um cytoplasmic inheritance?

3478
02:17:18,799 --> 02:17:24,879
Like if you had atrolops as the maternal

3479
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:26,879
the female parent they cross versus not.

3480
02:17:24,879 --> 02:17:28,558
Yeah. So that's a good point is that

3481
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:31,279
when crossing with these wild relatives,

3482
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:33,920
it can be really hard to use the wild

3483
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:36,079
relative as the female parent. Um we

3484
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,079
used the wild relative as the pollen

3485
02:17:36,079 --> 02:17:40,879
donor in all of our cases because

3486
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:42,398
especially with like a tasti those are

3487
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:45,438
some really small anthers. it's going to

3488
02:17:42,398 --> 02:17:48,079
be hard to pull those out. Um, so yeah,

3489
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:49,359
we did use the recurrent whatever had

3490
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:51,120
the recurrent parent in it. That was

3491
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:53,280
always our female donor. So we didn't

3492
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,599
specifically look at maternal versus

3493
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:57,920
paternal inheritance, but that would

3494
02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:00,639
definitely be interesting to do. Yeah.

3495
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,398
Um, I want to ask what has been your

3496
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:04,959
greatest challenge in this research and

3497
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:09,079
also what is the thing that you're most

3498
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:09,079
excited or passionate about?

3499
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:15,840
most excited about is this. Uh we were

3500
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:17,398
really really not expecting these things

3501
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,840
to look very good in the

3502
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:21,599
field. They are not super drought

3503
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:23,679
tolerant. I mentioned that drought

3504
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:25,040
escape strategy. That's not necessarily

3505
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:28,318
desirable because that's going to

3506
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:30,160
shorten the uh grain filling period. So,

3507
02:18:28,318 --> 02:18:32,159
the fact that we were able to get

3508
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:34,398
upwards of 80 bushels an acre grain

3509
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:37,760
yield off of these materials was a

3510
02:18:34,398 --> 02:18:40,079
really encouraging um result, especially

3511
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:43,359
because there's simultaneous research

3512
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:45,920
that's going on alongside at our um at

3513
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:48,479
the USDA in Manhattan, Kansas using

3514
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,398
Emmer in direct crosses to where when

3515
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:51,760
making comparisons between things using

3516
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:53,599
the direct crossing approach and the

3517
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:55,679
amphiploid bridge approach, there's a

3518
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:58,318
significant difference to where we

3519
02:18:55,679 --> 02:19:01,359
really like the um integression strategy

3520
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:04,000
we used and I would say the most

3521
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:04,000
challenging

3522
02:19:04,519 --> 02:19:13,760
thing I think that there are not a wide

3523
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:17,280
variety of resources to train um

3524
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:19,040
graduate students in breeding analyses

3525
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:21,519
if that makes sense. So the kind of some

3526
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:24,160
of the technical aspects, it's hard to

3527
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:26,478
get exposure to both the practical and

3528
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:28,318
the theoretical. And so having being

3529
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:31,119
able to bring those two things together

3530
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:33,359
and kind of think at every stage of the

3531
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,359
process, what might be going on and

3532
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:38,960
thinking of a plant as a whole system

3533
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:42,079
and not just puzzle pieces, but a whole

3534
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:47,039
all together, but I could list a million

3535
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:49,439
things. Cool. Thank you so much. Yeah,

3536
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:51,120
we have time for one more question, but

3537
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:53,520
if not, then we uh will come back here

3538
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:54,880
at 3:25 for Samantha's talk. But enjoy

3539
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:58,960
the coffee, everybody, and give it up

3540
02:19:54,879 --> 02:20:01,920
for potentially speciation. And so we're

3541
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:04,079
thinking about um these processes

3542
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:06,559
happening at an evolutionary time scale.

3543
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:08,280
So we're thinking hundreds to millions

3544
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:10,639
of generations.

3545
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:12,479
And we have these kind of three main

3546
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:14,719
processes, mutation, selection, and

3547
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:15,799
drift that are really big shapers of

3548
02:20:14,719 --> 02:20:18,639
this genetic

3549
02:20:15,799 --> 02:20:20,719
diversity. Um, but sometimes there can

3550
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:22,879
be these hybridization events between

3551
02:20:20,719 --> 02:20:25,279
two species where instead of getting

3552
02:20:22,879 --> 02:20:28,000
half of a genome's worth of DNA from

3553
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:30,640
each parent, you get the full genome

3554
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,799
from mom and the full genome from dad.

3555
02:20:30,639 --> 02:20:35,039
So instead of one and one making two,

3556
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:37,759
you get two and two making four. Or a

3557
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:41,680
tetroploid.

3558
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:46,079
And uh over these evolutionary time

3559
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:50,239
scales uh we can see this DNA sequences

3560
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:51,920
are being lost. Um and this process is

3561
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:55,359
called diploidization where that

3562
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:58,159
polyloid species becomes something like

3563
02:20:55,359 --> 02:21:01,520
a diploid again. And this process of

3564
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:04,398
sequence lost is called fractionation.

3565
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:07,200
And while DNA sequence loss is a major

3566
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:10,559
consequence of polyloy and basically the

3567
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:13,280
response to this uh event, there can be

3568
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:16,318
other changes including uh changes to

3569
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:18,800
gene expression or changes to existing

3570
02:21:16,318 --> 02:21:23,398
gene functions to change slightly that

3571
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:26,000
gene function or even develop novel

3572
02:21:23,398 --> 02:21:29,199
functions. And it's not just the genes

3573
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:31,200
that are duplicating in these events. Um

3574
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:34,720
these are affecting all the other

3575
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:38,000
genomic elements including repeat space

3576
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:39,840
uh like uh transposable elements and

3577
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,760
also all of those regulators that are

3578
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:45,760
affecting gene

3579
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:47,680
expression. And so when we have these

3580
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,159
whole genome duplication events, we are

3581
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:52,960
generating this massive pool of genetic

3582
02:21:50,159 --> 02:21:55,520
diversity and thus a huge pool of

3583
02:21:52,959 --> 02:21:58,879
adaptive potential. And this process of

3584
02:21:55,520 --> 02:22:00,960
fractionation whittleles that pool down.

3585
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:03,119
But during this process, we can also see

3586
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:07,119
these bursts of diversification where

3587
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:09,120
there are many more forms of species um

3588
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:13,040
either forms of the same species or form

3589
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:14,240
or even whole new species forming that

3590
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:17,160
could be adapted to different

3591
02:22:14,239 --> 02:22:20,079
environments compared to that parental

3592
02:22:17,159 --> 02:22:22,000
species. And so in this way polyloy and

3593
02:22:20,079 --> 02:22:24,318
fractionation are major shapers of

3594
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:26,600
genomic diversity and structure.

3595
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:30,079
potentially leading to these novel

3596
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:33,600
forms. Okay, but you're probably asking

3597
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:35,439
yourself, well Sam, how common is this?

3598
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:37,640
Actually, this seems like this would be

3599
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:40,800
a pretty rare

3600
02:22:37,639 --> 02:22:43,680
occurrence. Um, but actually polyot is

3601
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:46,159
very common, particularly in plants. Um,

3602
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:49,200
and so here, this is a wonderful kind of

3603
02:22:46,159 --> 02:22:51,920
mini review about it. um where they made

3604
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:55,280
a fogyny using all of the plant emojis

3605
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:55,280
available to you on your emoji

3606
02:22:55,799 --> 02:23:01,438
keyboard and they put all of the whole

3607
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:04,479
genome duplication events that we have

3608
02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:07,520
observed as red dots and all the whole

3609
02:23:04,478 --> 02:23:10,639
genome triplication. So instead of being

3610
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:13,600
two, right, you have three

3611
02:23:10,639 --> 02:23:15,279
um on onto the spogyny and hopefully you

3612
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,439
can see that there's quite a large

3613
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:19,920
number of them.

3614
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:22,960
Now if we have an estimate of what that

3615
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:25,439
genome size was right here at the base

3616
02:23:22,959 --> 02:23:27,759
of this fogyny right either how many

3617
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:31,359
chromosomes was in that original genome

3618
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:34,079
or how much DNA as like in poggrams

3619
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:36,680
there was we can then say okay if you've

3620
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:39,200
been through so many rounds of

3621
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:41,280
duplication we can multiply that

3622
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:43,439
starting number of chromosomes and DNA

3623
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:46,399
weight to get an estimate of how big

3624
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:48,720
that genome should be now and And that's

3625
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:50,719
what's indicated here in yellow with

3626
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:53,398
being chromosome numbers and blue being

3627
02:23:50,719 --> 02:23:56,879
that genome size and just total DNA

3628
02:23:53,398 --> 02:23:58,599
mass. Um, and with the darker colors

3629
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:01,398
being bigger

3630
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:04,960
genomes. But what do we actually

3631
02:24:01,398 --> 02:24:06,879
see? We see much smaller genomes and

3632
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:09,679
much fewer chromosome numbers than we

3633
02:24:06,879 --> 02:24:12,559
would expect here in those kind of inner

3634
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:14,479
circles that are much lighter in color.

3635
02:24:12,559 --> 02:24:17,279
Now, personally, I find these color

3636
02:24:14,478 --> 02:24:19,599
scales really difficult to parse and

3637
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:20,680
compare, and so I'd rather show you this

3638
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:25,359
histogram

3639
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:29,520
instead. Um, here we have uh genome

3640
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:32,559
size, right, in poggrams on this x axis

3641
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:34,479
for thousands of angioperms.

3642
02:24:32,559 --> 02:24:36,799
And the high edge of this histogram,

3643
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:39,519
while there is a long tail at much

3644
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:42,799
larger genome sizes, the edge of this

3645
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:44,800
histogram is at 30 pogs, which is about

3646
02:24:42,799 --> 02:24:47,119
where the arrow is pointing to on the

3647
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:48,719
original scale. So, as you can see,

3648
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:51,600
we're not even getting into those darker

3649
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:54,279
colors. It's all these um basically

3650
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:57,559
gradations of bright bright

3651
02:24:54,280 --> 02:25:00,800
blue. Okay?

3652
02:24:57,559 --> 02:25:05,439
So all of these small genomes have to be

3653
02:25:00,799 --> 02:25:08,478
due to these um really large amounts of

3654
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:12,800
DNA sequence lost over time given all of

3655
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:14,719
these uh poly events. And since in this

3656
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:17,358
talk I really want to focus in on this

3657
02:25:14,719 --> 02:25:19,879
process of fractionation I want to

3658
02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:22,800
reiterate this with a simplified

3659
02:25:19,879 --> 02:25:25,279
cartoon. And so here this cartoon is

3660
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:27,759
really nice in that we have a red genome

3661
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:30,399
and a blue genome that come together to

3662
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:32,559
form a polyloid that has six

3663
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:34,719
chromosomes. Three from blue, three from

3664
02:25:32,559 --> 02:25:38,959
red.

3665
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:40,879
And over time we see sequence loss where

3666
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:41,639
maybe those chromosomes start to shrink

3667
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:45,358
in

3668
02:25:41,639 --> 02:25:46,879
size. And maybe over some more time some

3669
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:49,040
of those chromosomes start to fuse

3670
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:51,599
together. And so we see a reduction in

3671
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:54,560
overall chromosome number. And maybe

3672
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:57,120
over really really large time scales we

3673
02:25:54,559 --> 02:26:00,239
see something that looks like a diploid

3674
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:03,120
or has been rediploidized and we're back

3675
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:06,600
down to a chromosome number of three.

3676
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:09,760
Now, this is a really nice simple

3677
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:12,079
cartoon, but as a biologist, when I'm

3678
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,639
coming up to this species at the kind of

3679
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:16,799
end of this cycle, I don't see red and

3680
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:19,519
blue. I just see something that looks

3681
02:26:16,799 --> 02:26:22,398
like a diploid with three chromosomes.

3682
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:24,640
And so the only way we can see this

3683
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:26,959
history of duplication to parse apart

3684
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:29,519
those red and blue uh chromosome

3685
02:26:26,959 --> 02:26:32,639
segments is by aligning these quote

3686
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:34,800
unquote purple chromosomes to uh either

3687
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:37,559
the red or the blue genome or something

3688
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:40,519
that's very similar to one of

3689
02:26:37,559 --> 02:26:42,799
those. Okay, but what do I mean by an

3690
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:44,720
alignment? So here we have this

3691
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:48,079
ancestral species. And now each of these

3692
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:51,119
colored triangles represents a gene and

3693
02:26:48,079 --> 02:26:54,439
given some time we might see speciation

3694
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:58,000
um giving us these two descendant

3695
02:26:54,439 --> 02:27:00,159
species. Genes that arise from that same

3696
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:04,000
common ancestor. So the red triangles

3697
02:27:00,159 --> 02:27:06,559
here we call these orthologes.

3698
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,398
And when we see all of these orthologes

3699
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:12,000
kind of conserved in the same order and

3700
02:27:09,398 --> 02:27:14,519
orientation, we call that cintonyine,

3701
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,439
right? This conserved gene

3702
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:21,040
order. Now, over time, structural

3703
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:23,439
variants such as inversions or um

3704
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:26,720
insertion and deletion events can break

3705
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:28,720
up this ciny, making it harder to to see

3706
02:27:26,719 --> 02:27:30,478
these conserved pieces of the

3707
02:27:28,719 --> 02:27:34,318
chromosome.

3708
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:36,478
Um, so when you see in bow ties in um

3709
02:27:34,318 --> 02:27:38,600
some future slides, know that that's due

3710
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:41,119
to these inversions,

3711
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:43,600
right? Okay. But now let's add in some

3712
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,160
polyability on top of this. Okay. Let's

3713
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:47,680
say one of those species suddenly has a

3714
02:27:46,159 --> 02:27:50,799
whole genome duplication event and now

3715
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:52,960
there's two of everything. Each copy of

3716
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:54,478
that genome is called a subg genome.

3717
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:59,679
Here we're using subg genome one and

3718
02:27:54,478 --> 02:28:02,159
two. And each one of those um genes

3719
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:04,520
arising from that duplication event,

3720
02:28:02,159 --> 02:28:09,600
right? They're pairs from that same

3721
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:12,560
orthologue. Those are called homeologs.

3722
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:17,040
And when now we do these alignments with

3723
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:20,079
this now polyloid species back to the

3724
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:22,280
species that's remained diploloyid we

3725
02:28:20,079 --> 02:28:26,719
should see a

3726
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:29,840
2:1 ratio of cintin where for each part

3727
02:28:26,719 --> 02:28:33,398
of that reference diploid we see two

3728
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:36,639
pieces matching in that polyloid

3729
02:28:33,398 --> 02:28:38,799
genome. Okay.

3730
02:28:36,639 --> 02:28:41,119
Now I've been showing you a lot of

3731
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:43,079
cartoons. So let's start adding in some

3732
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:47,040
real data on top of

3733
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:49,719
that. So I study the trips which is this

3734
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:54,399
subtribe of grasses in the

3735
02:28:49,719 --> 02:28:57,599
anthropogan. Um it includes two uh genre

3736
02:28:54,398 --> 02:29:01,119
that is tpticum which is a wild grass

3737
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:04,000
that grows kind of um more in the United

3738
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:07,120
States and and in more northern regions.

3739
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,680
And then we have the genus Zia which is

3740
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:13,280
mostly centered in Mexico and central um

3741
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:16,639
America. And that's made up of a number

3742
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:19,439
of wild species mostly annual um as well

3743
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:21,439
as our domesticate maze.

3744
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:23,760
And since maize is a very important

3745
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:26,960
cultural and economic crop, we have a

3746
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:29,040
lot of genomic resources including 26

3747
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:32,000
genome assemblies that are chromosome

3748
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:34,560
level and cover a wide range of

3749
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:37,359
diversity including tropical and

3750
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:40,959
temperate material, sweet corns,

3751
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:43,559
popcorns, field corns. It's a good

3752
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:47,039
encompassing of maze

3753
02:29:43,559 --> 02:29:49,039
diversity. Okay. And we know that it had

3754
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:51,439
a whole genome duplication event about 5

3755
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:53,200
to 12 million years ago. And we know

3756
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:56,639
this because sorghum which has remained

3757
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:59,680
diploid over that time. We see a 2:1

3758
02:29:56,639 --> 02:30:02,398
relationship when we align these genomes

3759
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:04,398
to sorghum. So I know this is a

3760
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:07,439
complicated figure. Um we're going to

3761
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:10,159
walk through it. So along that x axis we

3762
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:12,800
have our sorghum chromosomes lined up 1

3763
02:30:10,159 --> 02:30:14,959
through 10. And on that Y-axis we have

3764
02:30:12,799 --> 02:30:18,559
the maze chromosomes lined up also 1

3765
02:30:14,959 --> 02:30:21,039
through 10. And each of those circles

3766
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:24,959
are representing areas of cintin that

3767
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:27,600
had been identified. And so when we look

3768
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:30,799
at sorghum chromosome 1, we see that

3769
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:34,559
there's a full copy of it essentially in

3770
02:30:30,799 --> 02:30:38,478
the maze chromosome 1. We also see a

3771
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:41,840
second copy of that sorghum chromosome 1

3772
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:45,199
split up across the maze chromosome 5

3773
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:48,478
and the maze chromosome 9. And so we see

3774
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:50,640
this expected 2:1 relationship that

3775
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:53,000
tells us that uh this was an ancient

3776
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:55,799
polyloid at some

3777
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:00,159
point.

3778
02:30:55,799 --> 02:31:02,000
Okay. So because we have all of these uh

3779
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:04,398
many chromosome level assemblies for

3780
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:06,520
maze, we've been able to study what's

3781
02:31:04,398 --> 02:31:10,159
happened to these subg genomes over

3782
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:12,239
time. And so for instance, we know that

3783
02:31:10,159 --> 02:31:14,959
one of those subg genomes, the maze one

3784
02:31:12,239 --> 02:31:17,119
subg genome has been preferentially

3785
02:31:14,959 --> 02:31:20,000
retained while the other one has been

3786
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:23,280
preferentially lost. And this is likely

3787
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:27,359
due to functionality differences. genes

3788
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:29,120
on the uh M1 subg genome are more

3789
02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:31,760
strongly expressed, right? And are

3790
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:34,479
likely contributing more to traits than

3791
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:36,680
the M2 genome.

3792
02:31:34,478 --> 02:31:38,879
Uh we also know that fractionation is

3793
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:40,960
ongoing meaning that if you were to take

3794
02:31:38,879 --> 02:31:44,478
two maze lines and you look at a

3795
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:44,478
particular uh pair of

3796
02:31:51,879 --> 02:31:56,799
homeologies are deleted but you might

3797
02:31:54,799 --> 02:31:58,959
see a different outcome in that other

3798
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:01,519
maze line.

3799
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:03,839
um suggesting that fractionation is not

3800
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:07,000
something that happened just long ago

3801
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,600
but is happening also um

3802
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:13,040
today.

3803
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:15,600
Okay. And I'm uh telling you about all

3804
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:17,840
of this because there was this recent

3805
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:19,760
project called the panandroprian project

3806
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:22,159
that did a lot of genome assembly not

3807
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:24,318
just in this subtribe but across the

3808
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:25,959
entire tribe of the androbaganier which

3809
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:29,680
is kind of warm seasoned

3810
02:32:25,959 --> 02:32:32,159
grasses and uh among these uh genomes

3811
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:34,720
that were assembling included a

3812
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:37,920
androagon virginicus which is a sister

3813
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:39,358
species to sorum. It's wild. Um but it

3814
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:41,040
has also remained deployed during this

3815
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:43,439
time frame and so can be used as a

3816
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:47,760
reference out group along with sorghum.

3817
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:50,079
Um we also have two uh new tricome

3818
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:53,200
genomes that are chromosome level as

3819
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:58,398
well as multiple wild zia genomes. So we

3820
02:32:53,200 --> 02:33:02,079
can combine all of these wild um genomes

3821
02:32:58,398 --> 02:33:04,639
with our maze genomes and thus get an

3822
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:07,120
unprecedented number of assemblies

3823
02:33:04,639 --> 02:33:09,680
representing descendants from the same

3824
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:12,880
whole genome duplication event. I want

3825
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:16,000
to reiterate this point because all of

3826
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:19,039
the information that we have kind of uh

3827
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:21,600
come to conclude about polyloids we have

3828
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:23,280
done through studying polyloids from

3829
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:26,000
different whole genome duplication

3830
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:28,720
events and comparing across them.

3831
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:33,359
Whereas this one, it's the same event,

3832
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:35,398
but uh all of these descendants um have

3833
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:38,479
have experienced just this

3834
02:33:35,398 --> 02:33:41,478
one. So this is really really exciting

3835
02:33:38,478 --> 02:33:44,639
because it allows us to ask two big

3836
02:33:41,478 --> 02:33:46,398
questions. One, how repeatable is

3837
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:47,920
fractionation across all of these

3838
02:33:46,398 --> 02:33:50,478
lineages? Right? It's the exact same

3839
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:53,680
event. How similar are their responses

3840
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:55,679
to it? And two, we can start to ask

3841
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:58,159
questions about when does fractionation

3842
02:33:55,680 --> 02:34:00,200
really occur relative to these species

3843
02:33:58,159 --> 02:34:02,719
diverging from each

3844
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:04,920
other. And so we're going to focus on

3845
02:34:02,719 --> 02:34:07,599
this first question

3846
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:10,239
first. So I told you that these are

3847
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:12,559
chromosome level assemblies, right? And

3848
02:34:10,239 --> 02:34:14,559
they're some of the first for trips. And

3849
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:17,119
so we're curious about how conserved

3850
02:34:14,559 --> 02:34:20,719
that cintony is between sorghum and

3851
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:24,160
tpticum. And so important to understand

3852
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:26,879
trum has 18 chromosomes and that

3853
02:34:24,159 --> 02:34:28,639
ancestral polyloid probably had 20. So

3854
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,358
there's not been a huge reduction in

3855
02:34:28,639 --> 02:34:33,039
chromosome number only losing two

3856
02:34:31,359 --> 02:34:35,520
chromosomes.

3857
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:39,600
And so when we compare it to sorghum,

3858
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:42,800
each of these um ribbons are colored to

3859
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:45,960
each of the 10 sorghum chromosomes. And

3860
02:34:42,799 --> 02:34:49,840
each ribbon represents cintony between

3861
02:34:45,959 --> 02:34:52,239
sorghum and the tricum genome. And

3862
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:53,960
hopefully what you can see is that for

3863
02:34:52,239 --> 02:34:57,920
each sorghum

3864
02:34:53,959 --> 02:35:02,279
genome you uh chromosome I should say

3865
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:05,280
excuse me um you see two trips

3866
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:07,520
chromosomes right only a couple where

3867
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:10,640
those chromosomes have been mashed

3868
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:13,120
together right to have that reduction to

3869
02:35:10,639 --> 02:35:15,439
18 chromosomes.

3870
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:17,840
Okay, so we see this massive

3871
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:22,840
conservation of chromosome structure

3872
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:25,840
between tpsum and its ancestral uh

3873
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:26,920
polyloid. What about zia? How is that

3874
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:29,439
different?

3875
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:31,000
Right? So when we look at zia, right,

3876
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:32,960
we're looking at 10

3877
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,200
chromosomes which is very different from

3878
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:37,519
trips. So there's been this massive

3879
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:39,680
reduction in chromosome number. And the

3880
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:43,760
way we get that is because when we

3881
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:46,800
compare to sorghum, each maze chromosome

3882
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,359
is basically a mosaic of many sorghum

3883
02:35:46,799 --> 02:35:50,879
chromosomes that have been mashed

3884
02:35:48,359 --> 02:35:53,280
together, right? And so we see these

3885
02:35:50,879 --> 02:35:55,478
huge chromosomeal rearrangements

3886
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:58,040
relative to

3887
02:35:55,478 --> 02:36:01,199
sorghum.

3888
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:04,640
Okay, but you might be asking yourself,

3889
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:07,359
Sam, you said you had over 30 genomes.

3890
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:10,318
You're only showing me two. What about

3891
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:12,479
all those other ones? How does cintiny

3892
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:14,959
to sorghum compare within and across

3893
02:36:12,478 --> 02:36:17,318
these genre? So at the bottom are our

3894
02:36:14,959 --> 02:36:19,119
two reference genome sorghum and

3895
02:36:17,318 --> 02:36:21,680
andropagenicus. And they're strongly

3896
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:23,840
cintenic to each other. And likewise our

3897
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:26,000
two types genomes are strongly synthetic

3898
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:29,840
to each other as they are to both of our

3899
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:34,920
reference out groups. Um and at the top

3900
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:37,719
is that maze uh reference genome B73.

3901
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:40,719
So I'm going to start adding in some

3902
02:36:37,719 --> 02:36:42,438
genomes. Let's start with our wild zeus

3903
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:46,000
species diploinus and

3904
02:36:42,439 --> 02:36:47,760
nicaraguensus. Um we see that they show

3905
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,318
lots of chromosomal rearrangements

3906
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,800
relative to sorghum but are strongly

3907
02:36:50,318 --> 02:36:55,359
centenic to each

3908
02:36:51,799 --> 02:36:58,000
other. And as we add in uh the wild

3909
02:36:55,359 --> 02:37:00,800
relatives that are subspecies of ZMAS

3910
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:02,398
such as carbaglamus, Mexicana and weii

3911
02:37:00,799 --> 02:37:03,920
tenensus

3912
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:07,119
um we can see that there are some

3913
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:10,398
inversions which are those bow ties. Um

3914
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:13,439
but we still see that cinty is strongly

3915
02:37:10,398 --> 02:37:15,279
conserved across the and we can add in

3916
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:17,600
the rest of our domesticated maze

3917
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:20,720
genomes and hopefully you can see it's a

3918
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:23,120
pretty consistent band of color across

3919
02:37:20,719 --> 02:37:25,039
all of these genomes.

3920
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:28,800
indicating that we have really strong

3921
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:33,040
conservation of syony within genre but

3922
02:37:28,799 --> 02:37:33,039
very different between

3923
02:37:33,239 --> 02:37:37,760
genre.

3924
02:37:35,239 --> 02:37:40,159
Okay. Now I also told you that this was

3925
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:41,600
part of a larger data set and I would be

3926
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:45,840
remiss if I didn't talk a little bit

3927
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:48,880
about that. Um and so this larger data

3928
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:52,159
set is looking at the whole angonier and

3929
02:37:48,879 --> 02:37:56,478
Michelle Stitzer um who's here in the

3930
02:37:52,159 --> 02:37:58,559
front row um has been looking at what

3931
02:37:56,478 --> 02:37:59,398
kind of has happened

3932
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:02,000
uh

3933
02:37:59,398 --> 02:38:05,039
tribewide and so we have been focusing

3934
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,760
on this one all genome duplication event

3935
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:11,200
but when we look across the andagan

3936
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:12,880
there have been many other polylo events

3937
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:15,520
and here I'm just highlighting and red

3938
02:38:12,879 --> 02:38:19,358
the whole genome duplication events. And

3939
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:19,359
when we look at the syony to

3940
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:25,399
there guys

3941
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:27,920
um what you should be

3942
02:38:25,398 --> 02:38:32,478
seeing is

3943
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:37,559
um there is huge ribbons of color coming

3944
02:38:32,478 --> 02:38:37,559
down between each of these chromosomes.

3945
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:43,280
Sorry, there's been some file formatting

3946
02:38:40,079 --> 02:38:46,879
uh struggles, but what you should see is

3947
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:50,000
this kind of very conserved chromosomeal

3948
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:51,839
structure across all of these genomes.

3949
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,318
Um, indicating that they look a lot like

3950
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:57,600
what we see in TPS. Another way of

3951
02:38:54,318 --> 02:38:59,920
saying that is that Zia is an outlier.

3952
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:02,079
Um, at least in an observational sense,

3953
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:06,520
if not a statistical sense. And I know

3954
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:10,318
this isn't particularly uh convincing

3955
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:12,640
but of that point but you can absolutely

3956
02:39:10,318 --> 02:39:16,279
convince yourself by looking at that QR

3957
02:39:12,639 --> 02:39:17,879
code which is the preprint for the

3958
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:21,280
panropagan

3959
02:39:17,879 --> 02:39:24,318
paper. So um please check out that

3960
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:26,920
preprint and believe me when I tell you

3961
02:39:24,318 --> 02:39:30,478
uh that that's what it

3962
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:32,879
shows. Okay. So, let's focus back down

3963
02:39:30,478 --> 02:39:36,799
into our whole genome duplication event

3964
02:39:32,879 --> 02:39:38,879
in Zia. Um, and here we're really

3965
02:39:36,799 --> 02:39:41,920
focusing on these potential outcomes for

3966
02:39:38,879 --> 02:39:44,159
pairs of genes, right? Either they are

3967
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:47,600
completely retained as duplicates within

3968
02:39:44,159 --> 02:39:50,119
a genome or one or the other have been

3969
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:52,318
lost or both are

3970
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:55,040
lost. And we identify these

3971
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:57,519
fractionation events by looking for

3972
02:39:55,040 --> 02:40:00,399
deletions within the exxons of genes. So

3973
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:04,800
the first thing we have to do is align

3974
02:40:00,398 --> 02:40:08,239
our genomes to sorghum um to identify

3975
02:40:04,799 --> 02:40:13,239
where deletions have happened in our uh

3976
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:15,760
zeia and tricum genomes versus

3977
02:40:13,239 --> 02:40:18,879
sorghum. We also know that one of those

3978
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:20,960
homeologues should be in the M1 subg

3979
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:23,119
genome and the other should be in the M2

3980
02:40:20,959 --> 02:40:26,959
subg genome. and we can figure out which

3981
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:28,800
is which using orthology and syony. We

3982
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:30,478
then need to combine this information so

3983
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:33,959
we know which homeologues had which

3984
02:40:30,478 --> 02:40:36,639
deletions um across each

3985
02:40:33,959 --> 02:40:39,599
genome. Basically making sure that we're

3986
02:40:36,639 --> 02:40:43,159
comparing blues to blues and reds to

3987
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:45,680
reds across all of these

3988
02:40:43,159 --> 02:40:50,478
genomes. And we're looking at about

3989
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:53,079
12,000 genes because while all our zeia

3990
02:40:50,478 --> 02:40:55,279
and trips genomes have been undergoing

3991
02:40:53,079 --> 02:40:57,600
fractionation, sorghum's been evolving

3992
02:40:55,280 --> 02:41:00,239
too, right? It it's not necessarily

3993
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:01,399
exactly what it was, you know, 12

3994
02:41:00,239 --> 02:41:04,719
million years

3995
02:41:01,398 --> 02:41:06,358
ago. And so, uh, we use that other

3996
02:41:04,719 --> 02:41:09,119
reference out group,

3997
02:41:06,359 --> 02:41:10,880
identicus to come up with these gene

3998
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:14,000
models that have the same number of

3999
02:41:10,879 --> 02:41:16,079
exxons across both of our reference, um,

4000
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,840
genomes. And those exxons have the same

4001
02:41:16,079 --> 02:41:19,600
length. Basically saying we think that

4002
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:21,600
these gene models are probably highly

4003
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,960
conserved and are more likely to be

4004
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:27,239
representative of what we would have

4005
02:41:22,959 --> 02:41:30,478
seen in that polyloid 12 million years

4006
02:41:27,239 --> 02:41:33,119
ago. And so these represent about 69,000

4007
02:41:30,478 --> 02:41:35,519
dex. And so just across genomes, when

4008
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:39,200
we're thinking about how much of M1 and

4009
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:42,399
M2 have been retained versus lost, we

4010
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:45,760
see that M1 is preferentially retained

4011
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:49,358
almost 60% to 40%.

4012
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:52,800
and M2 is preferentially uh lost in

4013
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:53,960
about the same kind of the reverse

4014
02:41:52,799 --> 02:41:57,279
um

4015
02:41:53,959 --> 02:42:00,159
proportions um suggesting that M1 has

4016
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:03,120
been um the preferentially retained

4017
02:42:00,159 --> 02:42:05,039
across all of these genomes. And that's

4018
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:07,399
exactly what we see when we now look at

4019
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:11,600
pairs of exxons across each of these

4020
02:42:07,398 --> 02:42:14,959
genomes where if one of those exxons is

4021
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:18,479
lost in a genome, more often than not,

4022
02:42:14,959 --> 02:42:20,279
it's the M1 that sticks around and it's

4023
02:42:18,478 --> 02:42:23,358
the M2 that's

4024
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:25,520
lost. But you might also be looking at

4025
02:42:23,359 --> 02:42:28,159
that section of where we see pairs of

4026
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:30,560
exxons retained that both retained. And

4027
02:42:28,159 --> 02:42:33,119
you might notice that our pink dots

4028
02:42:30,559 --> 02:42:35,279
which represent our tpsum genomes have a

4029
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:38,000
much higher percentage of exxons

4030
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:40,479
observed in that both retained category.

4031
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,879
Um this suggests that tpticum has

4032
02:42:40,478 --> 02:42:46,159
retained more pairs of exxons and thus

4033
02:42:42,879 --> 02:42:48,599
has had less fractionation um or or loss

4034
02:42:46,159 --> 02:42:50,359
of DNA than

4035
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:52,640
zia.

4036
02:42:50,359 --> 02:42:54,239
Okay, we've been talking about exxons,

4037
02:42:52,639 --> 02:42:56,559
but a lot of people they really want to

4038
02:42:54,239 --> 02:43:01,359
know what's happening at the gene level.

4039
02:42:56,559 --> 02:43:03,760
And so we can think about on average how

4040
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:05,760
many exxons from a home log have been

4041
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,359
lost. And we can break this down to

4042
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:09,520
percentages because not all genes have

4043
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:12,159
the same number of exxons, right? Keep

4044
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:14,319
it standard. And so here in black we

4045
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:16,959
have this reference um gene model for

4046
02:43:14,318 --> 02:43:19,760
three exxons. And we can think about if

4047
02:43:16,959 --> 02:43:22,799
one, two, or all three have been lost,

4048
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:25,040
right? You would see 33, 66, and and

4049
02:43:22,799 --> 02:43:27,039
100%.

4050
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:30,000
And so across each of these genomes,

4051
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:32,720
what we find in both M1 and M2, the

4052
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,439
majority of these homeologues have been

4053
02:43:32,719 --> 02:43:38,559
completely lost. There's no exxons left.

4054
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:40,159
Um there is a bump um where only maybe a

4055
02:43:38,559 --> 02:43:43,039
little bit of the home log has been

4056
02:43:40,159 --> 02:43:45,959
deleted in M1, but for the most part we

4057
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:48,800
see that the entire gene has been

4058
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:52,318
deleted. Which brings us to this perhaps

4059
02:43:48,799 --> 02:43:53,959
philosophical question of at what point

4060
02:43:52,318 --> 02:43:56,398
do we consider a gene to be

4061
02:43:53,959 --> 02:43:59,119
fractionated? How much do you have to

4062
02:43:56,398 --> 02:44:00,559
lose before you're no longer a gene?

4063
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:03,040
Right?

4064
02:44:00,559 --> 02:44:05,920
And I I don't have a satisfactory answer

4065
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:07,760
for you to that particular question, but

4066
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:10,000
I did try some different cutoffs. And

4067
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:12,800
I'm going to show you the most extreme,

4068
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:15,600
right? Um and so at the most liberal

4069
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:18,239
cutoff, we consider a gene to be

4070
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:20,640
fractionated if even a single exxon in

4071
02:44:18,239 --> 02:44:22,559
that gene has been fractionated. Even if

4072
02:44:20,639 --> 02:44:25,680
all the other ones are retained, only

4073
02:44:22,559 --> 02:44:29,439
one is is lost, then the entire gene is

4074
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:32,239
considered lost. And as you would expect

4075
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:34,279
under this very liberal definition, the

4076
02:44:32,239 --> 02:44:37,520
majority of our

4077
02:44:34,279 --> 02:44:40,640
exxons are considered lost. But we do

4078
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:42,960
see a handful of genes that are

4079
02:44:40,639 --> 02:44:45,599
completely retained, right? Meaning they

4080
02:44:42,959 --> 02:44:47,679
still have all of their exxons available

4081
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:51,279
to them.

4082
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:54,159
Um and then the kind of opposite extreme

4083
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:56,520
where every exxon in that gene has to be

4084
02:44:54,159 --> 02:45:00,799
lost for that gene to be considered

4085
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:03,200
fractionated. Um we see right there is

4086
02:45:00,799 --> 02:45:06,559
this bump in terms of the number of

4087
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:10,319
genes that are considered retained under

4088
02:45:06,559 --> 02:45:14,559
this very strict definition. But we

4089
02:45:10,318 --> 02:45:16,079
still see a strong amount of genes um

4090
02:45:14,559 --> 02:45:18,719
that are completely lost, meaning

4091
02:45:16,079 --> 02:45:19,639
there's no exxons left um of them in

4092
02:45:18,719 --> 02:45:23,519
these

4093
02:45:19,639 --> 02:45:24,959
genomes. So kind of the big thing that

4094
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:28,000
you should take away from this

4095
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:31,039
particular slide about genes is that

4096
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:35,520
whole gene loss is a heck of a lot more

4097
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:37,000
common than whole gene retention.

4098
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:41,600
And this got me

4099
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:44,959
wondering if an exxon or gene starts off

4100
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:49,079
on one particular ancestral chromosome

4101
02:45:44,959 --> 02:45:52,478
um instead of another

4102
02:45:49,079 --> 02:45:54,799
chromosome. How often is the outcome of

4103
02:45:52,478 --> 02:45:56,879
that fractionation different? Right? So,

4104
02:45:54,799 --> 02:45:59,119
are you more likely to be retained if

4105
02:45:56,879 --> 02:46:01,358
you're say on chromosome 1 than if

4106
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:04,200
you're on a different original

4107
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:06,720
chromosome from um here

4108
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:09,439
sorghum? And so what I'm showing you

4109
02:46:06,719 --> 02:46:11,199
here is for exxons and we take the

4110
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:14,000
percentage of exxons found on that

4111
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:15,920
reference chromosome in sorghum and we

4112
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,760
say how many of those exxons are

4113
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:19,439
considered both retained across our

4114
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:21,600
genomes.

4115
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:24,720
And what you can see is that if you're

4116
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:26,640
on sorghum chromosome 1, you are

4117
02:46:24,719 --> 02:46:29,920
actually much more likely to be observed

4118
02:46:26,639 --> 02:46:32,318
as being both retained than any other

4119
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:35,279
chromosome, particularly chromos sorghum

4120
02:46:32,318 --> 02:46:38,159
chromosome 5. Um, and so there's

4121
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:40,880
actually a difference in terms of how

4122
02:46:38,159 --> 02:46:43,760
often genes are fractionated based off

4123
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:46,239
of it seems which chromosome they

4124
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:51,359
originate from.

4125
02:46:46,239 --> 02:46:53,439
And so, uh, we can see that, um, this is

4126
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:54,880
true across many other of our

4127
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:56,800
fractionation categories. And so,

4128
02:46:54,879 --> 02:46:59,199
there's this large variation between

4129
02:46:56,799 --> 02:47:04,478
ancestral chromosomes. Um, which brings

4130
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:06,800
us to the big question, why why do we

4131
02:47:04,478 --> 02:47:08,639
see a difference? And again, I don't

4132
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:11,759
have a particularly satisfactory answer

4133
02:47:08,639 --> 02:47:14,639
to that, but I do have a hypothesis.

4134
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:17,200
And my hypothesis has to do with what

4135
02:47:14,639 --> 02:47:18,799
happened to those ancestral chromosomes.

4136
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:21,359
Right? So when we're looking at the

4137
02:47:18,799 --> 02:47:24,478
syony of sorghum chromosome 1 versus

4138
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:27,200
sorghum chromosome 5, we can see that

4139
02:47:24,478 --> 02:47:29,760
across both subg genomes, chromosome 1

4140
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:33,760
and sorghum has been retained in pretty

4141
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:36,159
large chunks. It's not very broken up

4142
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:38,318
even in zia where there's been a lot of

4143
02:47:36,159 --> 02:47:42,000
rearrangements.

4144
02:47:38,318 --> 02:47:44,318
But chromosome 5 from sorum is really

4145
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:45,920
sliced and diced. It's in really small

4146
02:47:44,318 --> 02:47:48,840
little bits and pieces. When you make

4147
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:52,478
those dot plots for cinty, it looks like

4148
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:54,960
confetti. They're so broken. And so I

4149
02:47:52,478 --> 02:47:56,959
think there might be this connection

4150
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:59,839
between rearrangement histories of these

4151
02:47:56,959 --> 02:48:02,839
ancestral chromosomes and the amount of

4152
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:05,920
fractionation that we observe

4153
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:08,960
today. Okay. So to summarize our answers

4154
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:11,120
to this first question, um what we find

4155
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:13,919
is that all lineages do show this biased

4156
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:16,000
retention of the M1 subgenome and that

4157
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:17,478
fractionation tends to affect all of the

4158
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:22,279
exxons within a

4159
02:48:17,478 --> 02:48:25,438
gene and that tsicum retains many more

4160
02:48:22,279 --> 02:48:28,239
homeologs than zia and that this perhaps

4161
02:48:25,439 --> 02:48:31,720
might be due to different chromosomeal

4162
02:48:28,239 --> 02:48:34,000
rearrangement histories.

4163
02:48:31,719 --> 02:48:35,920
Okay, so this brings us to our second

4164
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:38,639
question of when did when did these

4165
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:41,120
differences start? Um and and when did

4166
02:48:38,639 --> 02:48:42,639
all of this start to happen? And we can

4167
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:44,439
look at this in a number of ways. The

4168
02:48:42,639 --> 02:48:48,398
first way I want to talk about is

4169
02:48:44,439 --> 02:48:50,318
parsimony, which is this idea that the

4170
02:48:48,398 --> 02:48:54,639
simplest solution is likely the correct

4171
02:48:50,318 --> 02:48:58,159
one. So if we were to take the our obser

4172
02:48:54,639 --> 02:49:01,358
our observed states of retained versus

4173
02:48:58,159 --> 02:49:03,799
lost um if you could only put that

4174
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:07,200
fractionation event in one spot on the

4175
02:49:03,799 --> 02:49:11,119
tree where would the spot be that gives

4176
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:13,200
us this observed pattern. So in the blue

4177
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:16,640
case, we only see fractionation of an

4178
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:18,399
exxon in a single species and so it must

4179
02:49:16,639 --> 02:49:21,119
have happened much more recently after

4180
02:49:18,398 --> 02:49:24,239
that species diverged from the others.

4181
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:28,240
Whereas with the red copy, we see that

4182
02:49:24,239 --> 02:49:31,439
that fractionation event is found in two

4183
02:49:28,239 --> 02:49:34,239
of our uh genomes and so must have

4184
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:37,120
happened early earlier right before

4185
02:49:34,239 --> 02:49:40,559
those species diverged from each other.

4186
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:43,920
That's all we're doing here.

4187
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:45,840
And so, um, we're only using exxons here

4188
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:48,478
that have a definitive fractionation or

4189
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:51,040
retention call across every genome. So,

4190
02:49:48,478 --> 02:49:54,559
we're not using the full 69,000 exxons

4191
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:58,640
for this analysis. Um, but those that we

4192
02:49:54,559 --> 02:50:01,439
do use about 80% across both M1 and M2

4193
02:49:58,639 --> 02:50:04,799
are completely retained or completely

4194
02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:06,479
lost across every genome.

4195
02:50:04,799 --> 02:50:09,358
This suggests that the majority of

4196
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:11,679
fractionation must have happened earlier

4197
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:14,239
um before the divergence of trips and

4198
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:14,920
zia about a little over half a million

4199
02:50:14,239 --> 02:50:17,840
years

4200
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:19,840
ago. And about 10% of those exxons can't

4201
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:22,239
be mapped to a single point on the tree.

4202
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:24,478
Meaning that um you'd have to put down

4203
02:50:22,239 --> 02:50:26,639
multiple fractionation events to get to

4204
02:50:24,478 --> 02:50:29,039
our that observed pattern. And so we're

4205
02:50:26,639 --> 02:50:31,239
grouping all of those instances under

4206
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:33,279
this term

4207
02:50:31,239 --> 02:50:34,959
paraphily. Okay. But if you're doing

4208
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:38,279
your math, you might be asking me,

4209
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:40,879
what's about the other

4210
02:50:38,279 --> 02:50:42,800
10%. Um, and so as we look at those

4211
02:50:40,879 --> 02:50:45,358
exxons that are fractionated across all

4212
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:51,039
of Zia but retained in both of our

4213
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:53,920
tricom genomes, we see that uh about 4%

4214
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:56,720
of exxons fit that description. Whereas

4215
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:59,279
the reverse exxons that have been lost

4216
02:50:56,719 --> 02:51:01,840
across both of our trips genomes and

4217
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:03,079
retained across all of the Zia genomes

4218
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:04,600
is only about

4219
02:51:03,079 --> 02:51:07,680
1%.

4220
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:10,318
Um this is more evidence that trips has

4221
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:13,120
experienced less fractionation than zia

4222
02:51:10,318 --> 02:51:16,478
and that this is likely due to increased

4223
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:18,319
fractionation in zia after they um start

4224
02:51:16,478 --> 02:51:20,438
to diverge from each other. So after

4225
02:51:18,318 --> 02:51:22,959
that speciations

4226
02:51:20,439 --> 02:51:24,520
event. But that leaves us with the the

4227
02:51:22,959 --> 02:51:28,398
last 5% of

4228
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:31,920
exxons. And um that is divided into

4229
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:34,318
smaller and smaller increments where the

4230
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:36,799
exxon is fractionated in either a

4231
02:51:34,318 --> 02:51:39,760
handful of lines or even just a single

4232
02:51:36,799 --> 02:51:42,159
um individual genome. And while these

4233
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:44,398
percentages are low, it does mean that

4234
02:51:42,159 --> 02:51:47,039
recent fractionation was detected across

4235
02:51:44,398 --> 02:51:49,199
all lineages. And thus fractionation at

4236
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:52,000
these exxons could be different across

4237
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:53,760
genomes.

4238
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:56,639
which gets us to this question of how do

4239
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:58,200
you even measure that? Um, and gets us

4240
02:51:56,639 --> 02:52:00,239
to this term of differential

4241
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:02,000
fractionation, which is just a way to

4242
02:52:00,239 --> 02:52:04,920
capture how different is fractionation

4243
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:06,799
for a given locus across these

4244
02:52:04,920 --> 02:52:08,559
genomes. So, when things aren't

4245
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:10,879
different at all, where every single

4246
02:52:08,559 --> 02:52:13,278
genome has the exact same status for an

4247
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:16,719
exxon, we can say it has one status,

4248
02:52:13,279 --> 02:52:19,120
right? No differential fractionation.

4249
02:52:16,719 --> 02:52:21,119
But perhaps maybe when we look across

4250
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:24,399
all genomes, we see two of these

4251
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:26,439
potential statuses. Um, and that is a

4252
02:52:24,398 --> 02:52:29,840
little bit of differential

4253
02:52:26,439 --> 02:52:33,200
fractionation. And we can add and add

4254
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:35,439
until we see all four statuses across

4255
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:36,960
our genomes would be the most

4256
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:38,600
differential fractionation that you

4257
02:52:36,959 --> 02:52:40,519
could possibly

4258
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:43,279
observe.

4259
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:47,680
Um, and so this is this is what I mean

4260
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:50,399
by one, two, three, and four statuses.

4261
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:52,960
And so here we have those statuses going

4262
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:55,680
from um no differential fractionation

4263
02:52:52,959 --> 02:52:57,719
there at one to the most differential

4264
02:52:55,680 --> 02:53:01,680
fractionation that you could observe at

4265
02:52:57,719 --> 02:53:05,679
four. And each black point is the

4266
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:08,398
percentage of exxons that we see in or

4267
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:11,680
that particular number of statuses

4268
02:53:08,398 --> 02:53:14,559
across all of our genomes. And so the

4269
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:18,960
majority of our exxons, right, only show

4270
02:53:14,559 --> 02:53:20,559
one um fractionation pattern um

4271
02:53:18,959 --> 02:53:22,199
indicating that it's all shared, right,

4272
02:53:20,559 --> 02:53:25,600
which we had just seen in our previous

4273
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:27,439
analyses. But about 35% of these exxon

4274
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:30,479
pairs show some differential

4275
02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:32,000
fractionation across genomes, right?

4276
02:53:30,478 --> 02:53:34,000
Which is pretty stunning. We weren't

4277
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:38,239
expecting that at all. We're expecting

4278
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:38,239
things to be very similar across these

4279
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:42,560
genomes. But again, we've been talking

4280
02:53:40,959 --> 02:53:45,119
about exxons and everyone wants to know

4281
02:53:42,559 --> 02:53:46,879
what's happening at the gene level. So

4282
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:50,560
here I have an example of some real

4283
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:54,000
data. We have this sorghum gene that has

4284
02:53:50,559 --> 02:53:56,799
13 exxons and I've made a representative

4285
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,840
of the M1 home log across a few of our

4286
02:53:56,799 --> 02:54:03,119
genomes where you can see perhaps in the

4287
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:07,439
trips we see many of these exxons are

4288
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:09,040
retained but exxon one and 10 are lost.

4289
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:12,159
And when we look across our zia, we see

4290
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:14,680
a lot more exxons are gone. Um, and just

4291
02:54:12,159 --> 02:54:16,600
a few are retained, if any at

4292
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:19,760
all. And

4293
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:22,120
so, as you're looking at this, you might

4294
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:26,559
be wondering, how do you even begin to

4295
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:28,560
summarize comparisons um across um the

4296
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:31,920
sharing and differences of fractionation

4297
02:54:28,559 --> 02:54:36,318
and retention across all these different

4298
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:40,520
genomes? Remember, we've got about 30

4299
02:54:36,318 --> 02:54:43,039
plus genomes and 12,000 genes to

4300
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:46,079
evaluate. And so I've come up with this

4301
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:48,080
particular system where you can have

4302
02:54:46,079 --> 02:54:50,600
these three levels where fractionation

4303
02:54:48,079 --> 02:54:53,439
has occurred in two genomes that you're

4304
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:55,200
comparing. Um, if that fractionation is

4305
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:57,600
completely shared, right, the exact same

4306
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,760
exxons are lost across both genomes. We

4307
02:54:57,600 --> 02:55:01,920
call that complete sharing. Whereas if

4308
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:04,000
only some of those exxons have been

4309
02:55:01,920 --> 02:55:07,279
fractionated in both genomes, it's just

4310
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:09,760
some. And if some exxons are

4311
02:55:07,279 --> 02:55:11,200
fractionated in each genome, but they're

4312
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,680
completely different exxons that are

4313
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:17,439
lost, right? There's no overlap in which

4314
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:20,960
genes or which exxons are lost. Um

4315
02:55:17,439 --> 02:55:23,200
that's no sharing. We can then also add

4316
02:55:20,959 --> 02:55:25,679
in the layer of how closely related are

4317
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:27,840
the two genomes that we're comparing.

4318
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:30,000
Right? So if they're the most closely

4319
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:31,159
related, they're excessions of the same

4320
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,959
species,

4321
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:38,079
right? Um and on the other end of the

4322
02:55:34,959 --> 02:55:42,079
spectrum, we would be comparing a genome

4323
02:55:38,079 --> 02:55:44,639
from tricum versus a genome in Zia. And

4324
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:48,120
in the middle, we'd have some comparison

4325
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:52,239
of um genomes that aren't the same

4326
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:54,560
species, but are not um but are in the

4327
02:55:52,239 --> 02:55:56,559
same genus, right?

4328
02:55:54,559 --> 02:55:58,278
So these are comparisons within our Zia

4329
02:55:56,559 --> 02:56:01,840
subspecies and and

4330
02:55:58,279 --> 02:56:05,279
species. Okay, I go through this to help

4331
02:56:01,840 --> 02:56:07,159
us understand this particular box plot

4332
02:56:05,279 --> 02:56:11,200
because there's a lot of information

4333
02:56:07,159 --> 02:56:13,119
here. Um and so when we are looking at

4334
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:15,600
home logs where there's fractionation

4335
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:19,040
occurring in both, but that

4336
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:22,399
fractionation is completely shared in

4337
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:24,800
the light pink and and light green at

4338
02:56:22,398 --> 02:56:27,199
the top here. we see that there's the

4339
02:56:24,799 --> 02:56:29,278
greatest amount of sharing. And these

4340
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:31,200
represent comparisons between genomes

4341
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:34,079
that are closely related, excessions of

4342
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:36,240
the same species. And when we look at

4343
02:56:34,079 --> 02:56:38,239
kind of more diverged genomes, right,

4344
02:56:36,239 --> 02:56:42,159
comparisons between a tricum and a zia

4345
02:56:38,239 --> 02:56:45,879
genome, we see less complete sharing.

4346
02:56:42,159 --> 02:56:49,840
And as we look at more uh differential

4347
02:56:45,879 --> 02:56:54,318
um um sharing of fractionation

4348
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:56,559
um or less sharing we see that um those

4349
02:56:54,318 --> 02:57:00,000
more diverged genomes so our trips

4350
02:56:56,559 --> 02:57:01,680
versus zia genomes show um are much more

4351
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:04,120
prevalent in these categories where

4352
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:06,720
there's less and less

4353
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:08,479
sharing. Also note that it's very very

4354
02:57:06,719 --> 02:57:11,079
rare that none of the fractionation is

4355
02:57:08,478 --> 02:57:14,159
shared at all. Right?

4356
02:57:11,079 --> 02:57:16,799
Um most often when we see fractionation

4357
02:57:14,159 --> 02:57:18,318
between these um two genomes uh that

4358
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:21,159
we're comparing there's at least some

4359
02:57:18,318 --> 02:57:22,920
overlap in which exxons are

4360
02:57:21,159 --> 02:57:26,079
lost.

4361
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:27,760
Okay. Whenever we see patterns that are

4362
02:57:26,079 --> 02:57:30,398
either shared or different across

4363
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:32,559
lineages, we want to know why. Why is

4364
02:57:30,398 --> 02:57:35,519
there sharing and why might there be

4365
02:57:32,559 --> 02:57:37,920
differences? And so this naturally comes

4366
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:41,159
to the question of selection.

4367
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:46,318
And dnds is a way of measuring

4368
02:57:41,159 --> 02:57:49,119
selection. Um so on this scale we have

4369
02:57:46,318 --> 02:57:51,439
uh dnds of zero refers to purifying

4370
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:57,040
selection which is the removal of bad

4371
02:57:51,439 --> 02:58:00,079
alals from a population and at uh one or

4372
02:57:57,040 --> 02:58:02,880
much greater than one uh dnds that would

4373
02:58:00,079 --> 02:58:06,079
be positive selection. So promotion or

4374
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:07,799
or uh keeping around really good alals

4375
02:58:06,079 --> 02:58:10,600
in a population.

4376
02:58:07,799 --> 02:58:14,398
Now if

4377
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:17,680
uh differences or or changes between two

4378
02:58:14,398 --> 02:58:20,000
genomes, right, if those have a DNDs of

4379
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:21,279
one, that means that those changes are

4380
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,639
neutral, right? They're not under

4381
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:25,840
selection. They might not have a

4382
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:27,840
functional or a fitness effect, right?

4383
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:29,398
And so any changes that we see there is

4384
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:34,239
likely due to

4385
02:58:29,398 --> 02:58:37,119
random changes, right? Random drift.

4386
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:40,799
Um and so when we look at those genes

4387
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:43,359
that show complete sharing um between a

4388
02:58:40,799 --> 02:58:46,159
focal genome and any other genome, we

4389
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:48,960
see that the majority of the DNDS values

4390
02:58:46,159 --> 02:58:51,760
that we have for those genes are at uh

4391
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:53,679
centered on zero, right? Um meaning that

4392
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:56,279
they're under purifying selection. So

4393
02:58:53,680 --> 02:59:01,600
selection is acting to remove

4394
02:58:56,279 --> 02:59:08,920
um uh u delletterious variance. But as

4395
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:12,000
we look at um genes where uh they have

4396
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:14,478
um less and less sharing between

4397
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:17,279
genomes, we see that that distribution

4398
02:59:14,478 --> 02:59:20,159
moves further further away from zero and

4399
02:59:17,279 --> 02:59:24,319
closer to one. Meaning that they are

4400
02:59:20,159 --> 02:59:26,879
more likely under weakened or relaxed

4401
02:59:24,318 --> 02:59:29,199
purifying selection or are becoming more

4402
02:59:26,879 --> 02:59:31,799
neutral and thus affected by more random

4403
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:36,479
changes.

4404
02:59:31,799 --> 02:59:39,119
Okay. So what does all of this even mean

4405
02:59:36,478 --> 02:59:42,000
in terms of when fractionation occurs,

4406
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:44,399
right? So big picture, the majority of

4407
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:46,959
fractionation is shared, right, across

4408
02:59:44,398 --> 02:59:49,119
all of these genomes, suggesting that it

4409
02:59:46,959 --> 02:59:51,000
happened before these species began to

4410
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:54,240
diverge. So long, long

4411
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:56,079
ago. However, we do see a large

4412
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:57,600
proportion of exxons that show

4413
02:59:56,079 --> 03:00:00,239
differential fractionation, meaning that

4414
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:03,079
fractionation is indeed ongoing. and at

4415
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:05,239
larger scales than perhaps we

4416
03:00:03,079 --> 03:00:07,920
expected. And that sharing of

4417
03:00:05,239 --> 03:00:10,000
fractionation on a gene bygene basis

4418
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:12,398
seems to be correlated with relatedness

4419
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:14,318
with more related genomes sharing more

4420
03:00:12,398 --> 03:00:17,199
of the fractionation

4421
03:00:14,318 --> 03:00:18,879
um patterns and that this is any

4422
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:22,960
differences that we see are likely being

4423
03:00:18,879 --> 03:00:25,119
driven by relaxed purifying selection.

4424
03:00:22,959 --> 03:00:27,519
Okay, now I know that was a lot and so

4425
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:29,600
some big takeaways from this study is

4426
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:31,760
that fractionation is much more dynamic

4427
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:34,559
as a process than we really expected to

4428
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:36,079
see. Um while the majority of

4429
03:00:34,559 --> 03:00:38,559
fractionation which was shared across

4430
03:00:36,079 --> 03:00:41,840
all of these genomes including the bias

4431
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:45,840
retention of M1 over M2 homeolog um and

4432
03:00:41,840 --> 03:00:45,840
the loss of entire

4433
03:00:49,478 --> 03:00:54,559
homeologicum genus and members of the

4434
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:56,800
Zia genus which we did not expect at

4435
03:00:54,559 --> 03:00:58,079
all. I can't emphasize that enough. we

4436
03:00:56,799 --> 03:00:59,519
really expected that all of these

4437
03:00:58,079 --> 03:01:01,840
lineages that descended from the same

4438
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:06,479
whole genome duplication event would be

4439
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:07,920
very similar to each other. Um and so we

4440
03:01:06,478 --> 03:01:09,599
hypothesized that these strong

4441
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:11,279
differences might be related to

4442
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:14,880
different chromosomeal rearrangement

4443
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:17,439
histories between these two. And finally

4444
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:19,920
um differences in these fractionation

4445
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:22,880
between genomes are probably likely

4446
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:23,719
driven by drift right and are correlated

4447
03:01:22,879 --> 03:01:26,559
with

4448
03:01:23,719 --> 03:01:28,719
relatedness. And it's usually at about

4449
03:01:26,559 --> 03:01:30,278
this point in any talk I give on this

4450
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:33,478
subject that somebody asks this

4451
03:01:30,279 --> 03:01:35,760
question. What about sub and

4452
03:01:33,478 --> 03:01:37,199
neofunctionalization? Um, and you might

4453
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:40,079
be saying, Sam, those are some really

4454
03:01:37,200 --> 03:01:42,600
big new words. Did you did you use those

4455
03:01:40,079 --> 03:01:45,840
in your talk? And I did not. I did

4456
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:48,800
not because we really focused on

4457
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:51,439
retention versus fractionation as the

4458
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:53,599
potential outcomes of this downsizing.

4459
03:01:51,439 --> 03:01:56,159
But actually there are many outcomes for

4460
03:01:53,600 --> 03:02:00,800
duplicate genes after a polyploia event.

4461
03:01:56,159 --> 03:02:03,439
Um they can um be subfunctionalized

4462
03:02:00,799 --> 03:02:05,519
which is where that original function of

4463
03:02:03,439 --> 03:02:08,398
that gene is split across these two

4464
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:11,439
copies either by each copy taking part

4465
03:02:08,398 --> 03:02:13,599
of of the original job or by becoming

4466
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:16,159
tissue specific. So one gene is used for

4467
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:19,680
that job in specific tissues and the

4468
03:02:16,159 --> 03:02:21,520
other gene is used in different tissues.

4469
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:23,359
They could also become neofunctionalized

4470
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:26,319
which is where one copy retains that

4471
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:30,479
original function and the other copy is

4472
03:02:26,318 --> 03:02:32,799
allowed to mutate and generate um new

4473
03:02:30,478 --> 03:02:35,358
sequence and basically create a new

4474
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:38,159
novel function. And these are really

4475
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:41,200
cool. They're also really really

4476
03:02:38,159 --> 03:02:43,439
difficult to prove and require a lot of

4477
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:45,200
molecular work to validate them. And so

4478
03:02:43,439 --> 03:02:47,120
I chose not to investigate them in this

4479
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:48,920
study. That's not to say that these

4480
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:52,079
aren't necessarily happening in these

4481
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:56,079
genomes. Um, just to say that they would

4482
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:57,520
be really hard to study. And I do have a

4483
03:02:56,079 --> 03:02:59,120
really great example of

4484
03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:00,800
neopunctionalization where they did do

4485
03:02:59,120 --> 03:03:03,439
that kind of validating work. So, if

4486
03:03:00,799 --> 03:03:06,959
you're excited about that, uh, this was

4487
03:03:03,439 --> 03:03:08,720
an instance of sodium ion channels um

4488
03:03:06,959 --> 03:03:11,278
that were duplicated after a whole

4489
03:03:08,719 --> 03:03:13,840
genome duplication event in fish. and

4490
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:15,319
one of those copies of that sodium ion

4491
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:18,318
channel uh

4492
03:03:15,318 --> 03:03:20,519
neofunctionalized to basically become an

4493
03:03:18,318 --> 03:03:23,199
electric sensory organ in

4494
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:25,040
fish. So if you're interested in that,

4495
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:26,600
highly recommend reading that paper.

4496
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:30,399
It's really

4497
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:32,000
cool. Okay, but it's not just maze,

4498
03:03:30,398 --> 03:03:34,398
right? We're plant biologists. We like

4499
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:37,959
to think about all of all of the other

4500
03:03:34,398 --> 03:03:41,039
many uh diverse species available to us.

4501
03:03:37,959 --> 03:03:42,639
Um, and so what we can take away from

4502
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:45,040
this beyond just what it means for maze

4503
03:03:42,639 --> 03:03:47,439
and its wild relatives is that polyloy

4504
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:49,040
and fractionation have shaped every

4505
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:51,520
plant genome through these multiple

4506
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:54,160
rounds of expansion and downsizing. And

4507
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:56,880
so a fractionation is much more dynamic

4508
03:03:54,159 --> 03:03:59,119
between descendants of the same event

4509
03:03:56,879 --> 03:04:01,039
than we previously expected. What does

4510
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:03,040
that mean for all of our other polylo

4511
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:05,520
events um and all of the descendants

4512
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:08,000
from from those?

4513
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:09,359
How um do we see that this connection

4514
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:11,920
between chromosome stability and

4515
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:15,120
fractionation when we look at across all

4516
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:17,520
of these other um polyloids? Um what

4517
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:20,720
might make chromosomes more stable than

4518
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:22,880
others? And how we haven't even touched

4519
03:04:20,719 --> 03:04:24,879
life history or some of these other kind

4520
03:04:22,879 --> 03:04:26,959
of biological factors that might

4521
03:04:24,879 --> 03:04:29,278
influence these processes occurring at

4522
03:04:26,959 --> 03:04:31,039
the genome level.

4523
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:32,560
And so since this is a plant breeding

4524
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:35,840
symposium, I wanted to have this one

4525
03:04:32,559 --> 03:04:39,119
takeaway slide of what does this study

4526
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:41,359
add to plant breeding. And so um

4527
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:42,800
hopefully through this talk you've

4528
03:04:41,359 --> 03:04:45,279
gained an appreciation for how

4529
03:04:42,799 --> 03:04:46,879
fundamental these processes are for

4530
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:49,680
generating the diversity and structure

4531
03:04:46,879 --> 03:04:51,438
of modern plant genomes. Um, and that

4532
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:54,000
while many outcomes of these processes

4533
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:55,600
are shared across lineages, descendants

4534
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:58,239
of the same whole genome duplication

4535
03:04:55,600 --> 03:05:01,000
event may have very different outcomes

4536
03:04:58,239 --> 03:05:04,000
in terms of what diversity is kept or

4537
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:06,318
lost. And finally, that these processes

4538
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:08,478
develop novel, potentially adaptive

4539
03:05:06,318 --> 03:05:10,359
variation beyond what was available in

4540
03:05:08,478 --> 03:05:12,478
those parental

4541
03:05:10,359 --> 03:05:14,960
species. With that, I would like to

4542
03:05:12,478 --> 03:05:17,920
thank all of my funding agencies, um,

4543
03:05:14,959 --> 03:05:19,599
mainly NSF who have supported this work.

4544
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:22,719
all of my wonderful co-authors and

4545
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:24,960
labmates, my PhD committee members and

4546
03:05:22,719 --> 03:05:26,398
um the practical hletype graph team for

4547
03:05:24,959 --> 03:05:29,039
their help and support in completing

4548
03:05:26,398 --> 03:05:31,760
this work. I'd also be remiss as a

4549
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:33,920
postoc not to mention that I'm working

4550
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:35,600
on a completely new project with my

4551
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:38,000
adviserss Jeff Rossy Barara and Graham

4552
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:40,840
Cooper at UC Davis looking at human

4553
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:43,680
domestication of maze as a bioultural

4554
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:45,920
co-evolution. Um I'd be happy to discuss

4555
03:05:43,680 --> 03:05:48,000
this project more with folks um during

4556
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:49,279
the social hour later. Um, but I just

4557
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,439
wanted to mention that that's what I'm

4558
03:05:49,279 --> 03:05:52,560
working on

4559
03:05:50,439 --> 03:05:54,720
currently. And so with that, thank you

4560
03:05:52,559 --> 03:05:58,159
so much for your time and attention. I'd

4561
03:05:54,719 --> 03:06:01,679
be happy to take any of your questions.

4562
03:05:58,159 --> 03:06:04,680
We are over time, but I'll take like one

4563
03:06:01,680 --> 03:06:04,680
question.

4564
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:09,760
All right.

4565
03:06:06,760 --> 03:06:12,200
Um, I wanted to ask what your greatest

4566
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:14,800
challenge is in this

4567
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:17,359
research and what you're most excited or

4568
03:06:14,799 --> 03:06:19,119
passionate about with this research.

4569
03:06:17,359 --> 03:06:21,279
Yeah. So, I think the hardest part about

4570
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:23,840
this was developing the methods, right?

4571
03:06:21,279 --> 03:06:27,680
Trying to come up with a way to

4572
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:30,000
accurately identify fractionation and

4573
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:32,000
that it be the same fractionation across

4574
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:34,439
each of these genomes. that was really

4575
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:36,959
challenging um to use these tools um

4576
03:06:34,439 --> 03:06:39,600
that might not have been built for that

4577
03:06:36,959 --> 03:06:42,000
particular purpose. Um but I I use them

4578
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:45,520
for it. Um and what I'm really excited

4579
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:49,439
about is just the amazing diversity um

4580
03:06:45,520 --> 03:06:51,600
that we can study uh given all these new

4581
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:53,920
genomes and genome assemblies. There's

4582
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:56,559
so much big data out there. There's so

4583
03:06:53,920 --> 03:06:58,559
many cool questions that this data

4584
03:06:56,559 --> 03:07:00,879
allows us to address and answer from

4585
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:02,239
basic biology that we previously

4586
03:07:00,879 --> 03:07:03,358
couldn't really get at. And so I'm

4587
03:07:02,239 --> 03:07:05,600
really excited about the the

4588
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:08,239
opportunities that big data give us.

4589
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:10,800
Cool. Thank you so much. One last round

4590
03:07:08,239 --> 03:07:12,520
of applause.

4591
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:14,879
So we are approaching the end of the

4592
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:17,200
symposium. I would like to thank all the

4593
03:07:14,879 --> 03:07:20,159
speakers for taking their time to come

4594
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:22,800
all over to Ithaca and give these

4595
03:07:20,159 --> 03:07:26,639
wonderful presentations. uh I'm really

4596
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:29,039
grateful to to them and also for uh the

4597
03:07:26,639 --> 03:07:30,879
audience I'm grateful to you for giving

4598
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:33,840
your presence here and making this

4599
03:07:30,879 --> 03:07:35,920
symposium a success. Uh lastly I would

4600
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:39,120
also like again like to thank my uh

4601
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:41,520
planning committee members who have been

4602
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:44,079
a a source of support to the symposium

4603
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:47,120
and to me. Um with this I would like to

4604
03:07:44,079 --> 03:07:50,079
say that we have a social hour uh

4605
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:54,359
outside and with this we can end the

4606
03:07:50,079 --> 03:07:54,359
symposium. Thank you.

4607
03:07:54,879 --> 03:08:02,519
