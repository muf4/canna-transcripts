00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,919
University hello everyone thanks for

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,000
coming my name is Philip Lanza I'm a PhD

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,879
candidate with Louie in the farmers data

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,480
lab we work with Farmers to kind of help

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,759
them experiment a little better get more

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,960
value from their experiments more or

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,359
less so I'm going to talk about first

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,679
some of the projects I'm working on and

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,240
at the end go over some more the stuff

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,678
our lab does um what I'm working on is

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,000
applying obs ational research techniques

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,839
to agronomic systems um you know they

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,320
work well in medical trials where things

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,320
are complex the data is kind of messy um

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,960
there are data driven approaches and the

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,799
big thing that we need to do this is

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,439
context so you know in medical it would

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,078
be like does this person smoke was their

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,000
age range all these things in farming

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,280
you know we we use relevant biophysical

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,359
and environmental data that let us kind

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359
of objectively say okay well this

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,359
happened what context did it happen in

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,000
you know um so the challenge to that in

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,040
in the projects I'm doing one is a way

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,239
to help get this data to where we can

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,840
use it the next is showing something we

29
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,759
can do with these data and the last is

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,400
doing some analysis to show that it can

31
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,400
kind of help hopefully improve kind of

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,080
experimental interpretation and that

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,159
sort of thing so the first thing I did

34
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,959
was design a system to help us get all

35
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,560
these contextual data um so any kind of

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,919
agronomically relevant environmental

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,240
data like weather um you know Terrain

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,200
main data soil data all these things

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,879
this lets you do it in an easy to use

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,399
interface it's web based you pull it

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,399
down and it um generates everything in a

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,159
consistent format next thing um building

43
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,718
an ncas in anomaly detection system to

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,000
identify areas at subfield scale right

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,359
now 3 meter resolution of anomalous crop

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,078
response so given all these covariant it

47
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:00,438
should be responding this way based upon

48
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,478
ndvi this isn't and then you know

49
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,959
identify that so then one we can

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,399
identify these areas and send Scout

51
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,519
scouts out there to find them or find

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,479
out you know this experiment had a bunch

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,080
of bad areas so maybe it may not be the

54
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:17,359
best last thing I'm doing a comparison

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,040
using the anomaly data on a

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,680
commonly accepted uh correlation of the

57
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,400
great you know soil Health versus yield

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm using production environment so

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,480
Health Data from uh Joseph and Harold's

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Group which is thanks for letting me use

61
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,799
and then I'm going to analyze it um

62
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,598
where areas have no anomalies versus

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
like variant degrees and see like my

64
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,079
assumption is that no anomalous areas

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,840
will be stronger correlation than that

66
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,120
can show like you know when we account

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,120
for these things we can get kind of

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,719
better you know experimental design and

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
plan things better and just account for

70
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,000
like kind of uncertainty so lastly we're

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,959
forers data lab this is the website if

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,080
you like QR codes here's the QR code uh

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,000
we're transdiscipline AR we co-create

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Solutions with Farmers using you know

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,158
Agronomy data science GIS social science

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,158
here's some cool lab numbers we have a

77
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,318
new postto abdale we're growing we're

78
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,639
getting some new members in the fall I'm

79
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,439
looking forward to working with and if

80
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,399
you have any questions about what I'm

81
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,039
doing or what we're doing I'll take them

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,480
now yeah Phil how many farmers are you

83
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:31,438
working with um I say like 12 right now

84
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:34,479
is that right we have 24 sites

85
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,199
Farmers yeah so we're trying to grow if

86
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,560
you have any Farmers you know you know

87
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,000
who might want to work with us let us

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
know do you anticipate increasing that

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
in the future is that like something

90
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,798
that's expanding or is that is it 12 a

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,039
good number like that from my point of

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,680
view the more the better you know like a

93
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,519
lot of the techniques I

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,840
use are data driven you know so the more

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,319
the better um and then we'll get right

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,878
now ours forums cover a lot of the state

97
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,518
but you know the more representation you

98
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,239
have kind of the better data you get and

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,000
then the more people we work with the

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
more people can help hopefully

101
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,438
so what types of cropping systems are

102
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,360
you working like what what the farmers

103
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,000
growing and roughly how large are the

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Farms that you're working yeah sure

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,040
they're um a lot of dairy farms they're

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,478
growing you know grain corn Stover corn

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,000
um the anomaly detection stuff I'm going

108
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,599
to be working with soybeans but um

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,720
pretty much any grain crop you know that

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,439
that's what I'm trying to work with

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,600
until we can can work with other higher

112
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,519
value crops maybe in a couple years or

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,520
so so yeah field crops you know

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,038
Agronomy thank you very much um you said

115
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,639
that you're using this information so

116
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,918
you can design better experiments that

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,600
to me doesn't seem like the kicker you

118
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,719
kind of want to get that out to the

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,199
farmer so H how are you actually making

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,039
that linkage and taking this information

121
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,280
to inform the farming Community itself

122
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:01,839
sure well one example you know what we

123
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,559
work with it's a little different we

124
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,399
don't impose experimental design we we

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,918
work with endogenous experimentation so

126
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,000
the farmer some do like side by side

127
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,639
strips which is great other ones we've

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
worked with in the past have designed

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
their say control around the border of a

130
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,400
field which you know as we know isn't

131
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
like standard growing conditions um but

132
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,120
what I'm saying with the context we can

133
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,198
pull down this to give us objective data

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,800
that we can then use to kind of explain

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
a little more about what's going on and

136
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,280
then the anomaly um we can go in the

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,759
past and say okay well this experiment

138
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,719
didn't turn out exactly how we thought

139
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
looking at these anomalous areas maybe

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,919
their treatment area had a bunch of them

141
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,198
within it so it wouldn't be kind a

142
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,799
standard crop response which we can use

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
to say okay well we better interpret

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,199
this going forward you know if we

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,800
consistently identify anomalous areas it

146
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,080
may be it's probably a biophysical cause

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,038
when we if we do help them design their

148
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,439
experiment say hey don't put your thing

149
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,199
here put it here so did that kind of

150
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,000
answer answer that helps a lot and

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,240
you're working right with them in the

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,160
first instance yeah sure sure

153
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,879
sure all right thanks

154
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,360
everyone so my name is Becky stup I a

155
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,719
first year Master student studying in

156
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Tony D tamasos lab and I'm here to talk

157
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,000
about my thesis project which is

158
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,519
optimizing field barg management for

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,598
weed control and ecosystem

160
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,240
services so why would a farmer want to

161
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,240
plant something in the margin of their

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,918
field so biodiversity plantings are very

163
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,400
well studied at this point uh they

164
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,598
improve biodiversity across multiple

165
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,359
trophic levels as well as provide

166
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,399
various ecosystem services such as

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,879
nutrient cycling water filtration and

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,399
more famously um pollination and

169
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,918
biocontrol of crop pest by providing

170
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,560
habitat for beneficial arth pods and

171
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,639
while the seeds can be prohibitively

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,079
expensive at times historically funding

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,918
for these plantings has been available

174
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,038
to Growers through programs like the

175
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,478
nrcs conservation stewardship program

176
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm not sure about the current status of

177
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,918
that but we know from talking to the RCS

178
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,840
that New York Farmers tend to put these

179
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,120
plantings way out in a corner of their

180
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,159
field rather than um close to their

181
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,720
propop mon culture so uh what are some

182
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,800
barriers to Farmer adoption that we're

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,520
facing uh right off the bat there's a

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,199
lack of research about how field margin

185
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,639
plantings affect weed communities within

186
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,759
the crop um especially in New York state

187
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,560
a lot of This research happens over in

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,960
Europe um so we're not really sure what

189
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,598
this might have or what what might

190
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,399
happen with this and additionally uh

191
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,719
Farmers have raised concerns to members

192
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,399
of our research group such as are these

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,199
plantings going to act as reservoirs for

194
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
weeds and is there a chance that these

195
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,800
beneficial plants might move into the

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
crop and then act as

197
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,560
weeds so in order to address these

198
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,158
concerns I am comparing weed and arrod

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,918
communities in both planted and

200
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,399
conventional margins uh so I have two

201
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,000
corn fields uh one up in Musgrave one

202
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,918
down the road in Varna and I've

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,038
established Wildflower plantings and

204
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,758
grass plantings which are either mowed

205
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,360
according to nrcs guidelines for weed

206
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,080
suppression when they reach a certain

207
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,080
height or they're left unmanaged for for

208
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,918
the rest of the season I also have

209
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,878
unplanted conventional margins which are

210
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,839
mowed when they reach a certain height

211
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,240
um some are mowed every three weeks

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,439
regardless of height and some are

213
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,360
sprayed at the same time as the corn so

214
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,439
at about V3 um and this is done to just

215
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,840
mimic what farmers are um actually doing

216
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
at this point in time so one thing that

217
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,038
I want to get into before I start

218
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,478
talking about my actual results from the

219
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,318
first year is that these are often

220
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,399
perennial plantings and they don't do

221
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,680
much during the first year so over here

222
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,679
on the left we have an example of great

223
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,958
establishment um most of those plants

224
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,399
are wild flowers but you'll notice a

225
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,598
lack of actual flowers um and we know

226
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,799
from previous research in this lab that

227
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,920
arthropods tend to show up more when

228
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,120
there are actual flowers rather than the

229
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,599
species itself all that to say arthropod

230
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,080
bonds did not differ across treatments

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,959
in this year also um if you're going to

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,278
have a weed problem it's typically going

233
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,599
to be in the first year uh because the

234
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,519
native perennials do tend to be out

235
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,079
competed by aggressive annual weeds so

236
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,759
uh this is the density during the first

237
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,879
year of establishment uh so the number

238
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,639
of weeds in half meter squared quadrats

239
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,799
and as you can see in July the main

240
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,919
difference that we're seeing is that the

241
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,679
glyphosate has significantly less weeds

242
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,519
than any of these planted treatments on

243
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,039
the right but by the time you get to

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,600
September there's basically no

245
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,480
difference across treatments and from an

246
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
agronomic perspective I would argue that

247
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,079
September is the more important month to

248
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,440
be looking at because that's when a lot

249
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,759
of our problematic weeds will be going

250
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,800
to seed we also collect did uh biom or

251
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:37,480
yeah biomass data so the red is the

252
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:40,159
broadleaf weeds green is grass weeds on

253
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,360
this side are the conventional unplanted

254
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,799
margins and this side is the planted

255
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,440
margins and you'll notice that each half

256
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,679
has two tall bars and two short bars I

257
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,519
know this is a complicated graph for

258
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,919
this presentation but the main

259
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,759
difference here is the mowing which is

260
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,000
pretty intuitive there's less biomass

261
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,039
when you mow but we're also not really

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,879
seeing a difference in the unplanted

263
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,679
versus planted strips so if you're a

264
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,799
farmer and you're concerned about weeds

265
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,039
in your um in your margin plantings uh

266
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,240
at least in the first year it's looking

267
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,240
like those feers are thankfully fairly

268
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,079
unfounded as long as you're following

269
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,120
nrcs um mowing guidelines I'm also

270
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,599
continuing a project from a previous

271
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,839
graduate student in our lab Sophie

272
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Westbrook um she was looking at how the

273
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,959
seating rates impact establishment and I

274
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,159
just wanted to show you what these

275
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,000
plantings look like about 3 years in

276
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,480
once they're actually established we are

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,839
also starting to see very ecological

278
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,560
important species like butterfly milk

279
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,600
weed start to show up which we haven't

280
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,000
seen in previous years and we've we're

281
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,800
supporting fairly healthy arthropod

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,799
communities so thank

283
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,838
you yeah wondering how does the

284
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:48,519
implantation works is it broadcasted yes

285
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,160
it is dead Machinery there or um so yeah

286
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,879
it we have in broadcast seeding I know

287
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,278
um some companies do Drill Seed but

288
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,480
especially with the grasses there tends

289
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,720
to be issues with them going through the

290
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,600
hopper because they're kind of fluffy so

291
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,320
yeah

292
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,320
um really great talk Becky I'm wondering

293
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
has there been any work mixing annual

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,320
and perennial wild flowers within a

295
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,759
mixture so that you the first year um

296
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,760
not in our region that I'm aware

297
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,559
of Becky uh you said like not a lot of

298
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,039
benefits from the first year I was

299
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,879
thinking like that's covering the soil

300
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,199
right that's like land cover so that's

301
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,759
like we talk about like protecting our

302
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,800
soil that's a really nice benefit to

303
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,838
have yeah you know it's not

304
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,039
um doing what the the nrcs is maybe the

305
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,360
main

306
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,799
purpose that's a good

307
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,000
point hello everyone uh my name is

308
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,359
praman Baja and I'm a first year PhD

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
student with Dr viin Kumar and today

310
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,720
I'll be presenting you some of the

311
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,480
studies that we conducted last year as

312
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,839
the integrated weed management approach

313
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,278
in corn and soyab

314
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,600
bean so corn and soyab bean are the

315
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,480
major one of the major crops and weeds

316
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,639
are one of the most significant pest

317
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,159
causing the yield reductions but what

318
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,839
farmers are doing these days they are

319
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,600
heavily reliant on the chemical weed

320
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,200
control so last year 96% of the corn

321
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,360
fields and 98% of the soybean Fields

322
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
receive the herbicide applications which

323
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,240
is huge and with this amount of over

324
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,040
aliance there is a problem of herbicide

325
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,680
resistance so there are currently 533

326
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,879
unique cases of herbicide resistant

327
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,958
weeds globally to 168 different

328
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,000
herbicides and also uh since uh last

329
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:31,078
three decades we have no new mode of

330
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,559
action for the herbicides

331
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,719
and over the top we have new problems uh

332
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,719
the palaram r and water Hamp which are

333
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,519
the most problematic weeds in the

334
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
midwest they have been recently

335
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,560
identified in the northeastern states

336
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
including New York and New York

337
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,638
populations have reported the glyphosate

338
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,680
resistance and also uh potential

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,440
multiple resistance to hppd and

340
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:56,319
photosystem to

341
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,040
Inhibitors so what is the need uh today

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,040
we are heavily reliant on chemical weed

343
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,599
control but it is a Time that we switch

344
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,360
to a more balanced approach for the

345
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
long-term uh environmental and

346
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,800
economical

347
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,480
sustainability so keeping that in mind

348
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,519
we designed some of the studies the

349
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,720
first study we were we are looking at

350
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,360
the cover crop termination timings along

351
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,560
with the herbicide strategies for the v

352
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,199
supression in Conn so uh we had two

353
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,719
termination timings uh early termination

354
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:25,919
and planting green uh early termination

355
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,160
we terminated the cover crop two weeks

356
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,958
prior to the corn Plantation and in the

357
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,159
planting green we planted corn uh in the

358
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:37,239
standing cover crop and we terminated

359
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,919
three 3 days after the corn

360
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,079
Plantation so it is said that more the

361
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:46,639
amount of biomass uh is related to heavy

362
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,439
uh more weed pression so at the time of

363
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,000
uh at a time of termination we have

364
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199
approximately two and a half times

365
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,399
higher uh cover crop biomass in the

366
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,879
planting green which we also observed in

367
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,759
the weed expression so this is the first

368
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,720
is the early termination with round up

369
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,680
no pre or post herbicides uh and this is

370
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
the planting green with effective pre

371
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,120
and post

372
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,559
herbicide and in the another objective

373
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
we are looking at the in uh the

374
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,559
three-way approach with the cultural

375
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,720
practices with the cover crops then in

376
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,078
season targeting the weeds with the pre

377
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
and post herbicides and in later season

378
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,879
we are targeting weeds with the seed

379
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,199
impact

380
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,120
Mill so we know the cover crops and

381
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,519
herbicides little bit about the seed

382
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,560
impact Mill

383
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,679
so seed impact Mill seed impact Mill it

384
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,359
is the uh attachment behind the combine

385
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,519
that it has the uh these Mills which

386
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,399
rotate at a very high speed so they

387
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,198
pulverize the wheed seeds coming along

388
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,958
with the chaff so so main objective is

389
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,319
the weed seed bank management so that

390
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,399
the weeds that are harvested they don't

391
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,278
uh go to the wheed seed bank and become

392
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,559
problematic for the coming

393
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,360
seasons and uh for the third objective

394
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,599
we are comparing different uh

395
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,680
non-chemical and chemical treatments for

396
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,839
the wheat seed bank management uh we are

397
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:10,198
using the Intero and electric reader uh

398
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,519
with the mat and uh seed impact Mill and

399
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,758
herbicides so seed impact Mill I have

400
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:19,360
already discussed a little bit about the

401
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,839
inore my videos are not working so inter

402
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,959
more it has the uh so it has the blades

403
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,079
here rotating blades which rotate at

404
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,518
approximately 1800 RPM uh targeting the

405
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,198
weeds in between crop R so this is how

406
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:38,679
the treatments look like after the

407
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:41,799
application so this needs the video

408
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,638
no so this is the electric weeder uh the

409
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,679
weed zapper that we are using this is

410
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,440
the generator behind the tractor and it

411
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,359
uh run uh gets the energy from the PTO

412
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,399
shaft of the tractor and the copper rod

413
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,680
in front of a tractor it gets

414
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,198
electrified which targets the weeds

415
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,559
which are above the soybean canopy

416
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:04,519
so this is how the Damage Done to the

417
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,479
weeds this is the Velvet Leaf and this

418
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,839
is the stem of the lamp squat completely

419
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,839
smoked

420
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:16,519
out so uh a bunch of herbicide studies

421
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,519
also we are conducting so here we are uh

422
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,759
evaluating the crop safety and the weed

423
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,120
control with the different doses of the

424
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,199
metribuzin so metribuzin is a

425
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,440
pre-emergent uh herbicide so we plant

426
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:33,559
the soyab bean we spray the herbicide

427
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,000
and before the crop emergence so 280 G

428
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,439
per hectare and 420 G this is the normal

429
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,078
field rate the farmer use but they

430
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,279
complained that there are some weed

431
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,039
escapes with that so we are we are

432
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:47,198
evaluating the different doses uh where

433
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:51,318
we can optimize the metrius and rates

434
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:53,318
and we also not uh U harm the crop so we

435
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,000
observe that uh when we go higher we

436
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:59,639
have a good weed control but when we go

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,600
a much higher than the uh uh labeled

438
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,959
rate we have the uh lower stand count

439
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,078
and also the reduced growth so these are

440
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,600
the pictures five weeks after the spray

441
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,078
and these are the same treatments eight

442
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,838
weeks after the spray so you can see we

443
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,918
have a good control here as compared to

444
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,279
the

445
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,480
non-treated and we also conducting some

446
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,678
of the uh herbicide studies with the

447
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,720
different pre and post herbicides in con

448
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,640
so water hemp as I already discussed

449
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,959
this is the the picture near the

450
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,038
Rochester uh in the farmer field this is

451
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,080
the amount of infest station so we are

452
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:35,359
conducting bunch of uh pre and post

453
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,240
herbicide strategy uh studies in the

454
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,719
con thank

455
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,319
you time for one or two questions thank

456
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
you very much um certainly at the higher

457
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,200
rates in the last pictures that you

458
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,200
showed us you're getting good control

459
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,679
but can you discuss what that means both

460
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,519
economically and environmentally to go

461
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,559
to those higher

462
00:17:53,519 --> 00:18:01,200
rates economically we'll have

463
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:05,480
uh we have have to uh it will increase

464
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,600
the cost of course uh and enir for this

465
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,038
particular chemical I don't think so

466
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:15,639
yeah because uh metrius is a very common

467
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,720
uh herbicide and it's not very costly uh

468
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,840
environmentally of there are many

469
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,480
studies that have been cond there people

470
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,399
are conducting with different herbicides

471
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,599
that how the soil microbiota is

472
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,759
affecting and but there is we we are not

473
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,439
conducting this o microbiota studies

474
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,919
that yes so you mentioned at the

475
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,480
beginning of your presentation that

476
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,320
there hasn't been much improvement on

477
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,319
weed management for like 30 years is

478
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,558
that what are kind of like the big

479
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:46,639
picture reasons for that like I said

480
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,879
that uh there's no new mode of action

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,400
like herbicides so it is because it it

482
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,440
is very costly it uh it has to spend

483
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,519
like millions of millions of dollars for

484
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,240
the new mode of actions so that is why

485
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,759
the companies like beer and CA they are

486
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,640
not releasing new hsde they are just

487
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,798
mixing different mode of actions like

488
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,400
hppd with the atrazine they are

489
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,480
releasing the new uh formulations

490
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
instead of new chemical because it's

491
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,038
very costly and it's very time consuming

492
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,038
it uh take like seven eight years to

493
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,359
release okay so um hello everyone my

494
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,319
name is chenone and I'm currently a

495
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,839
first year PhD student in drilo lab and

496
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,240
um today I'm going to talk about my

497
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,480
research project which is about a uh

498
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,000
apparent versus intrinsic temperature

499
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,319
sensitivity of so

500
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,919
respiration so um why so respiration

501
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,558
because it's almost the largest testal

502
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,240
carbon emission which emits about 60 to

503
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:53,079
80 pagram carbon per year from the uh

504
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,960
Landing to the atmosphere and which

505
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:59,038
makes uh up almost half of the total

506
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,919
terrestrial carbon influx and in the

507
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,038
meanwhile it also affects the soil

508
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,520
organic carbon storage capacity and more

509
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,839
importantly the carbon emitted from soil

510
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:12,279
respiration is growing rapidly through

511
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:15,639
year which indicates its um higher and

512
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:19,079
higher uh importance in global carbon

513
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,520
cying so um how soil respiration will

514
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,399
respond to changing climates for example

515
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,960
the uh changing temperatures or

516
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,720
precipitations uh so intrinsic

517
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
intrinsically if we consider the

518
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,558
chemical essence of soil respiration

519
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,400
it's basically uh a bunch of different

520
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,440
organic com compounds are oxidized by uh

521
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,320
to produce carbon dioxide and other

522
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,759
products and this processes is highly

523
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:46,079
influenced by the temperature and one

524
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,798
explanation is the arenia theory which

525
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,678
is shown in the left figure uh so in

526
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,839
this Theory the temperature will not

527
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,000
only influence the uh Mo molecular

528
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,240
energy distribution but also it will

529
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
influence the uh activation energy which

530
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,880
is the EA in the figure and hence it

531
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,280
will uh influence the chemical reaction

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,600
rate um and makes the reaction rate

533
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,720
increase exponentially with

534
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,759
temperature but if we consider the

535
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,200
enzyme catalysis in this reactions the

536
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,278
uh processes may be more complicated as

537
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,600
shown in the uh upper upper red figure

538
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,558
so uh in this cases the uh there may be

539
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,678
optimal temperatures for the reaction

540
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,480
rate to reach the

541
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,000
maximum so uh other than these uh

542
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,759
various intrinsic temperature

543
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,519
sensitivities of so respiration uh there

544
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,640
are also multiple environmental

545
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,319
constraints such as the soil moisture

546
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
and uh soil aggregation which can modify

547
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,038
the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of

548
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,399
soil respiration and uh moreover if we

549
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,679
consider the uh Collective response from

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,159
multiple processes in soil respiration

551
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,480
the uh observed the temperature uh

552
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,960
response which is the apparent

553
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,400
temperature response may be uh much

554
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,720
different from the intrinsic

555
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,278
ones so um so the question here uh is

556
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,038
should there be one or multiple

557
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:11,798
functions for the intrinsic temperature

558
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:14,798
sensitivity in different uh

559
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:18,679
ecosystems so um several Arguments for

560
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:21,319
this uh question um there are several uh

561
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,679
cases uh if the biochemical Pathways

562
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,519
governing the so respiration and so

563
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,640
organic carbon compositions are all the

564
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,679
similar uh in different Eco uh EOS

565
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,080
systems then there should be like

566
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,480
similar intrinsic temperature function

567
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:38,359
but uh which is also assumed in most of

568
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,720
the biochemical models but in the real

569
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,278
world uh the case may be different

570
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,798
because they they may have different

571
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:47,278
biochemical Pathways and organic carbon

572
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,839
compensations which can lead to quite

573
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:52,159
different intrinsic temperature

574
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,319
functions and to solve this questions

575
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,919
we've collected the uh soil respiration

576
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,759
observations from several uh several uh

577
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,120
incubation experiments and the results

578
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,879
do show a like different temperature

579
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,599
response to uh to the uh flya

580
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,799
respiration so in some cases the so

581
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,079
respiration increase exponentially as

582
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,679
shown in the right figure uh with

583
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,839
temperature but in other cases the C the

584
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,200
cell respiration May uh respond

585
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:26,519
sigmoidally or unimodally to the

586
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,960
temperature so based on these results um

587
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,960
we we would like to calculate the

588
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,278
intrinsic temperature response from the

589
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,880
incubation data to see if there's

590
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,240
Universal uh function type or there are

591
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,840
different kinds of intrinsic function Ts

592
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,880
for uh different ecosystems and the

593
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,319
followup question is that if there's

594
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,080
different intrinsic temperature

595
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:49,639
functions why what's the reason cost CA

596
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,639
this difference and uh after we get this

597
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,320
information from the incubation data set

598
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,600
we can furthermore uh incorporate this

599
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,558
uh temperature function into the

600
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,918
biochemical models to further simulate

601
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:05,278
the uh field mement of so respiration

602
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,200
and that's what we are going to do for

603
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,960
in the in the near

604
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,120
future okay thanks for your uh listening

605
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,120
any questions any

606
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,038
suggestions yeah please interesting

607
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,720
stuff I was wondering uh what you're

608
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,720
thinking about the the time scales at

609
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,120
which the incubation occurs versus uh

610
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,798
some of the time scales that you're

611
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,719
interested in in other words is

612
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:33,038
shortterm warming over the course of say

613
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,200
hours or days is that are going to have

614
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,720
different processes than say responses

615
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,880
to longer term Waring yeah uh I think

616
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,600
time scale is uh quite an important

617
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,760
factor to influence the temperature

618
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,000
sensitivity because they will uh

619
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,038
sometimes uh influence the uh substrate

620
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
availability the carbon quality such

621
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,759
kind of things and the incubation data

622
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,640
that we have right now our Cooperators

623
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:01,000
collected right now uh um focusing

624
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,559
mainly on shortterm uh incubation not

625
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
like for uh incubation for several years

626
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,359
or decades so basically the incubation

627
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,119
time scale is from several uh several

628
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:15,319
month to uh the longest maybe one year

629
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:18,319
or two years and not so longterm uh um

630
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:20,200
response uh not so long-term time scale

631
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,398
but I I believe there there may be

632
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,360
different uh temperature sensitivities

633
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:26,119
in a longer time

634
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,158
scale yeah

635
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,398
please this is in the nature of carbon

636
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,440
between the different experimental units

637
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:38,199
or were they all

638
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,360
similar uh uh so could you please CO2

639
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,480
Evolution from the your soil incubation

640
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,759
that's going to be based on the carbon

641
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,519
compounds that you have soil right so

642
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,640
were they equivalent across your

643
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,240
different treatments or are you looking

644
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,799
specifically at um the behavior of

645
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,440
different complexities of carbon within

646
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,319
your system oh I see uh so basically I'm

647
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,880
uh working on like the uh mixture of all

648
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,639
kinds of different carbon compounds so

649
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,960
uh So currently we cannot like separate

650
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,919
different carbon uh substrates and uh

651
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,120
and uh to to see if they have different

652
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,520
temperature functions so basically in

653
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,079
the incubation data set they have a soil

654
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:24,480
sample which is sampled from a par

655
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,439
particular set and uh it's well kind of

656
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,079
hard to separate like different kinds of

657
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,360
carbon in the soil

658
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,439
so but I but I think that's a good idea

659
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,759
maybe uh in the in the near future we

660
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,278
can work on

661
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,720
that okay thank

662
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:44,519
you right well good afternoon everyone

663
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,120
uh before I start uh on behalf of my

664
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,480
peers I want to this is an awesome

665
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,239
turnout like look at this this is

666
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,880
awesome uh yeah it really means a lot

667
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,599
for everyone showing up supporting the

668
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,960
first year cohort right Community is so

669
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,759
important right now as as Dr Buckley

670
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,000
alluded to so this is awesome to see

671
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,879
everyone showing support right so um so

672
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,319
my name is uh Nazir Adam sharifi feel

673
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,480
free to call me Adam I'm a first Year Ms

674
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,839
PhD student in the sustainable cropping

675
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,599
systems lab under Dr Matthew Ryan I'm

676
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,278
excited to follow Chen's presentation

677
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,639
and give an introduction to my own

678
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,599
research on no till corn

679
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,600
production so in the sustainable

680
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,918
cropping systems lab we do a lot of work

681
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,599
in organic no till rolled crimp systems

682
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,559
essentially what that means is we plant

683
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,678
a cover CR in the fall allowing it to

684
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,558
grow in over winter until it reaches a

685
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
suitable growth stage for

686
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,678
termination then we go in with a roller

687
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,960
crimper which is a steel drum with blunt

688
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,159
blades mounted on front of a tractor to

689
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,159
terminate that cover crop while

690
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,760
simultaneously planting our C cash crop

691
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,640
with a no till

692
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,919
planter and then after a few months if

693
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,159
all goes well the the goal is to have a

694
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,320
healthy cash crop with the Mt serving as

695
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,200
a protective layer to increase water

696
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,278
infiltration and reduce runoff The Mulch

697
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,840
also acts as a physical barrier to

698
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:08,398
suppress weed growth without the use of

699
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,639
tillage So based on our research we

700
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,599
truly believe that noil farming through

701
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,480
the integration of R crimped cover crops

702
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,918
has great potential to enhance field

703
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,919
Crop Production not only for organic

704
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,038
farmers but for the broader agricultural

705
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,320
community and currently there's a wealth

706
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,158
of studies that exist on no till soybean

707
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,759
planted into cover crops with our lab

708
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,840
contributing heavily to that literature

709
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:34,038
uh however research on notil corn

710
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,119
planted into cover crops remains limited

711
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,200
with previous work basing systems in

712
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,079
meeting the cropping systems

713
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,319
demands so in the sustainable cropping

714
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,720
systems lab we developed a 256 plot

715
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,879
surface response experiment to explore

716
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,759
organic noil performance under different

717
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,039
cropping system designs this approach is

718
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,759
valuable for understanding how multiple

719
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,319
variables such as nitrogen rates and

720
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,278
seeding rates interact and influence

721
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,319
response variables like weed biomass or

722
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,440
corn yield under different roll crimped

723
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,398
cover crops so in our study we are uh

724
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,120
examined field corn planted into two

725
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,918
rolled crimped cover crop mixtures a

726
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,719
hary vetch oat and a hay vetch serial

727
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,480
Rye mixture we also tested the impact of

728
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,960
supplemental weed management through the

729
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,880
presence and absence of inro mowing so

730
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,720
the Ino mower featur features five

731
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,240
individual mowing units that's designed

732
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,480
to cut between the crop row and

733
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,200
operating above the mul

734
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,399
surface and additionally we evaluated a

735
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,240
range of corn seeding rates in sidess

736
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,079
nitrogen rates so there's a lot of

737
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,919
things that one can do with such an

738
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,759
awesome data set and one Avenue I'm

739
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,559
exploring is a relatively new approach

740
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,240
to analyze surface response experiments

741
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,440
and that's pewi structural equation

742
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,359
modeling or PM I'm particularly excited

743
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,679
about PM because it provides a holistic

744
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,839
view of the aggro ecosystem making it

745
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,120
ideal to understand ecosystem

746
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,879
interactions it's a tool widely used by

747
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,319
pure ecologists so what you see here is

748
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,159
a simplified model of the interactions

749
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,599
that we expect to occur in our organic

750
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,519
no till corn system let's take a quick

751
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,678
look at how these factors are connected

752
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,880
so increasing corn density uh boosts

753
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,519
yield as does increasing side dress

754
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,080
nitrogen however side dress nitrogen can

755
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,919
also benefit weeds which increases weed

756
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,480
biomass and then more weeds negatively

757
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,960
impacts yields while higher corn density

758
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,000
suppresses those weeds through

759
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,919
competition and this is the general

760
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,480
framework but what happens when we apply

761
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,880
this to a hary vetch oat system with

762
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,558
inro mowing what about without inro

763
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,159
mowing how do these interactions begin

764
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:46,720
to shift take a quick look at some

765
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
preliminary results so let's start by

766
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,240
looking at the Harry Veet oat system

767
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,360
without inro mowing in this model a

768
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,720
solid line indicates a significant

769
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,359
effect while a DOT line represents a

770
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,278
non-significant effect based on P values

771
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:04,558
so in the hary uh oat system

772
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,319
without Ino mowing thyr nitrogen doesn't

773
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,918
significantly affect weed biomass but

774
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:10,918
what I want to focus on more here is

775
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,200
this finding the significant negative

776
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,000
impact of weed biomass on corn yield

777
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,600
this reveals a key uh Key System

778
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,519
constraint while Harry ve a legum cover

779
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,240
crop providing High nitrogen to that

780
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,000
corn uh it lacks sufficient above ground

781
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,759
biomass during the field season to

782
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,960
effectively suppress weeds

783
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,879
but by adding the inom mower for

784
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,038
supplemental weed management we achieve

785
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,720
an exciting outcome where weed biomass

786
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,558
no longer significantly affects yield

787
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
these preliminary bindings validate the

788
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,839
inom mower as an effective tillage free

789
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
weed control tactic for field corn and

790
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,278
for Simplicity I previously omitted P

791
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,759
values and standardized coefficients but

792
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,638
they offer very valuable insights right

793
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,000
these coefficients quantify the

794
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:00,918
influence between syst system components

795
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,038
so here we can see that uh corn density

796
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,240
ins side nitrogen have a relatively

797
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,038
similar impact on yield as shown by

798
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,000
their comparable values but how again

799
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,839
might this change in a nitrogen starve

800
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,159
system where maybe Harry uh serial Rye

801
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,480
is integrated into that cover crop mix

802
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,000
right will yield become a more strong

803
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,159
driver of of yield in this system like

804
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
these are the questions that we can

805
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,000
begin to answer with PM so moving

806
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,638
forward I'm excited to dive deeper into

807
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,919
this data and carry out a streamlined

808
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,199
version of the study to examine these

809
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,278
interactions across different site

810
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,720
locations and thank you so much for your

811
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:37,440
time and these are my acknowledgements

812
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,360
more than happy to take any questions if

813
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
we have

814
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:44,798
time when you do the roller Creer and

815
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,038
you have a mix uh is it hard to kind of

816
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,278
nail because I know like you have just

817
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,839
one one species you need to be at the

818
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,278
right time but if you hav mixed then

819
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:57,000
kind yeah yeah you're hitting me on all

820
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,278
the spots that hurt um so so yeah timing

821
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,638
is critical right and when you have a

822
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:02,558
mixture you're you're trying to uh aim

823
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,000
for critical timing of termination if

824
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,038
you don't terminate at the right time it

825
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
can come back up or if you terminate too

826
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,079
late it can reproduce seeds and infest

827
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,679
your seed bank so timing is critical and

828
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,240
yeah it's kind of like in hary vech oat

829
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,840
in a seral Ry mixture we try to aim

830
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,798
between 50 to 100% anthesis of that

831
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,638
serial rye and then mid to late that

832
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,720
flowering stage of that hay vetch so

833
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,398
it's kind of finding the nice in between

834
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,480
of where can we get the best kill of

835
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:32,038
both of them but excellent question yeah

836
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,759
Enrique notice any effect on Prop

837
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,440
emergence the

838
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,599
roller wow these are good questions yeah

839
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,038
yeah uh emergence is something that I'm

840
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,398
actually really interested in so I I was

841
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,638
an undergrad actually at Cornell

842
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,638
University and research assistant in the

843
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:48,119
Ryan lab freshman year and something I

844
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,158
see a lot around our experients is

845
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,199
emergence is always an issue and I am

846
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,080
really maybe technologically Optimist

847
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,319
here but hoping that some good planting

848
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,879
technology can cut through these thick

849
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,319
cover crop mulches because they provide

850
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,840
so much as I said weed suppression and

851
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,359
uh water infiltration and so erosion

852
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,119
which is a huge huge problem especially

853
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:11,358
in the Northeast so um technological

854
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,000
Optimist maybe but uh yeah emerg is

855
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,239
something to

856
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,719
consider oh yeah um in one of your

857
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,319
figures I was just thinking um where you

858
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,678
see an improvement in corn yield or

859
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,720
whatever crop yield at the end and

860
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,440
potential decrease in weed

861
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:33,279
biomass you include the inter mower do

862
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,280
those

863
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,480
benefits outweigh what would be the

864
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:42,118
additional cost of actually renting or

865
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,280
owning an inter R mower for a farmer

866
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,240
great question right if it's not

867
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,599
profitable why even use it um I really

868
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,918
hope to conduct the profitability

869
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,679
analysis I feel like all experience now

870
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,039
is like so important right it's it's

871
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,760
useful for the farmer it has to be

872
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,838
profitable right so that's something I'm

873
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,440
hoping to look at um in terms of like a

874
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:01,559
profitability analysis is compar

875
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,559
comparing the different treatment

876
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,039
combinations off the top of your head

877
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,559
like which combination of like cover CR

878
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:11,079
nitrogen inter rooing not in moing like

879
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:14,880
led to the highest yield wow uh good

880
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:17,519
question yeah so I can maybe uh so it's

881
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,200
hary bch oat treatment combined with Ino

882
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,960
mowing at a seating rate of 45,000 seeds

883
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:27,519
per acre in a nitrogen rate of 56 kgrs

884
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,119
of nitrogen per Hector I'll do that yeah

885
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,800
yeah do that do that and you'll get

886
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,680
hopefully perfect deals yeah but maybe I

887
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,359
should preface like this is in the very

888
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,039
early stages right no till organic horn

889
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:39,559
is not widely practiced so that's why

890
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,199
this experiment and this stuff is

891
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,000
important to maybe push it forward and

892
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:46,559
and fill the gaps of knowledge that we

893
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,760
have in this system

894
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,759
so thank

895
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,078
you this has been a production of

896
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,078
Cornell University on the web at

897
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,079
