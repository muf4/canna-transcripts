1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,589
so why why South and Southeast Asia you

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,618
know we'll talk in more specifics about

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,868
the course that Marvin and I are

6
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:22,990
involved with here in a few minutes but

7
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:27,039
but let me speak to this issue just for

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:31,449
a few minutes one is one reason that

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,058
we've about 16 or 17 years ago started

10
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:37,659
focusing on South and Southeast Asia was

11
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:40,530
the rapidly changing agriculture and

12
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:43,899
food systems and in those countries and

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,289
expanding economies important

14
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,000
development challenges you know we've

15
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:53,439
been going some of us have been going to

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,299
India for 30 plus years and every few

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,509
years you if you speak to the same

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,959
farmers about the water table in their

19
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:05,679
bore holes in the Punjab or in Haryana

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,409
or yupi they'll they'll talk about the

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,618
number of meters it's dropped climate

22
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:14,259
change so a number of development

23
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:16,718
challenges but also a lot of innovation

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,358
in India is one of the things that

25
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:21,339
really attracts me a few students have

26
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:24,548
been to south or Southeast Asia before

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,450
and and then recent improvements to

28
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:31,990
infrastructure that accommodates fairly

29
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,978
large groups in relatively rural areas

30
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:41,438
because that's where we go we we tend to

31
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:44,349
get off the beaten path the it's a an

32
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:47,019
interesting place for our students

33
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:49,629
ethnically very diverse diverse

34
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:54,459
religious affiliations this is certainly

35
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:56,379
not the entire list tropical cropping

36
00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:00,009
systems for most Cornell students is the

37
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:03,789
first time to see tumeric growing or

38
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:07,659
black pepper or cacao growing and being

39
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:09,429
processed or to pluck tea leaves or to

40
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,959
pick coffee or to taste

41
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:15,969
rambutan or jackfruit so it's it's a

42
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,628
rich experience for many of our students

43
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,379
from that perspective as well tremendous

44
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:26,289
variation in crops

45
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,289
farming systems farming philosophies

46
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:37,729
fascinating cultures really fascinating

47
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:42,409
culture and Marvin must have snuck this

48
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:44,750
one into and and of course Marvin's main

49
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,750
interest has to do with the fact that

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:52,189
it's warm in January and it's not warm

51
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,759
in Ithaca in January but seriously the

52
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:58,219
decision to focus this field course in

53
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,579
South and Southeast Asia about 17 years

54
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:05,240
ago had some really important

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,340
pedagogical dimensions as well first of

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,879
all we had really outstanding long-term

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,550
collaborators and three of them are in

58
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,750
this room the faculty from India right

59
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:23,000
now that we're eager to host us many

60
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:27,680
alumni in all sorts of organizations in

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,219
India that were very eager to host us we

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,800
had experienced and well-connected

63
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:36,919
campus champions JB ramens one of them

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,760
Syed Rizwan food science

65
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,909
Ronnie Kaufmann Peter Hobbs had worked

66
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:46,689
there for 20-some meters for four CIMMYT

67
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:49,219
so we had a number of people here that

68
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:52,520
had the sorts of connections and

69
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:57,439
experiences and knowledge to make a

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:59,480
really rich field course and then as I

71
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,079
just mentioned very briefly a moment ago

72
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:06,069
India is a place where we can see really

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,969
creative and successful innovation in

74
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:14,569
agriculture and in rural development

75
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:17,629
it's known around the world for the

76
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:22,219
innovative women's self-help group

77
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:24,110
movement the Ammal dairy cooperative the

78
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,180
Rajasthan watershed management

79
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,650
initiatives in LOD the list could go on

80
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,478
and on and on India's is really a place

81
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:35,120
where you can find some of the most

82
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,699
instructive some of the most impressive

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,990
some of the most inspirational

84
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,050
innovation when it comes to agricultural

85
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,870
development yes lots of challenges but

86
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:51,560
also a lot of talent and a lot of

87
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:56,990
innovation there as well and I think I

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:00,079
mentioned prominent alums moment ago we

89
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,680
have we have many of them and in this

90
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,948
course on this is the course that this

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,560
experience is packaged with it's

92
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:13,430
actually a sequence of courses a full

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,500
year sequence the title of its

94
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,879
agriculture and developing nations the

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,129
interdepartmental interdisciplinary

96
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,610
course has been offered for 50

97
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:29,659
consecutive years this is a 50th

98
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:32,810
anniversary for the course more than

99
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,770
1,800 students have participated in that

100
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:40,970
course over the last 50 years it it

101
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:43,310
reads like a who's who in lis among

102
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,849
leaders in international agriculture in

103
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:53,329
rural development I had a chance to look

104
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:57,620
over that list a few weeks ago many many

105
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:59,959
faculty at this institutional back up

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,560
here in a minute but no more famous

107
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,288
alums than these three right here your

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,050
colleague on the right there Chris Wayne

109
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:11,959
I think participated in the first one

110
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,569
didn't he Jamie yeah 50 years ago he was

111
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,788
a student in in the first at that time

112
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:20,089
it was called international agriculture

113
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:24,038
402 Chris Wayne bill fried Ronnie

114
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:27,098
Kauffman many other faculty members

115
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,389
maybe didn't participate as students but

116
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:31,209
but have been on the faculty they've

117
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:35,860
been dozens of people including many

118
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:39,109
that are currently in the in sips who

119
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,629
have participated as faculty members I

120
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,939
don't know Ken did you do it as a Ken

121
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,430
much in the back there you did probably

122
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:48,558
Ian merwin did Jane Mount Pleasant has

123
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,329
many many

124
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:57,639
of for the faculty your colleagues have

125
00:06:52,329 --> 00:07:01,098
participated in in this course the

126
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,079
looking at the alumni you know we find

127
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:04,819
many people who have gone on to be

128
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,509
leaders in the international AG research

129
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:12,139
centers the cg system we have many that

130
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,749
are professors not only at Cornell but

131
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:19,278
around the u.s. land grant system and

132
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:21,199
around the world leaders in in the World

133

service of USDA and on and on and on we

137
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:36,048
go the private sector you know we bump

138
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:39,468
into our students while we're in the

139
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:43,248
field who who worked for pioneer seeds

140
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:48,668
or Cargill or Mahindra American alums

141
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:52,579
who who went on to make a career in Asia

142
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:54,788
purposely interdisciplinary we not only

143
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:57,139
have students from all across cowls but

144
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:59,838
over the years we've had students from

145
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,239
the law school last year I think we had

146
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:06,499
three from the vet school payal our

147
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:09,318
engineering planning and so on and one

148
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:12,049
of the comments that that stuck with me

149
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,789
that that bill Frye made recently when

150
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:18,888
he was describing the experience he had

151
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:23,709
49 or 50 years ago in this course as a

152
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:27,379
student is that most of the time when he

153
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:30,649
in the intervening four plus decades his

154
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:35,178
his gone overseas to work he works on

155
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:40,578
one focused thing in one place and he

156
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:43,068
said the only time in his nearly 50

157
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:45,558
years of traveling overseas and

158
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:48,139
observing agricultural development the

159
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:51,318
only time that he's had a chance to see

160
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:53,600
things as whole systems very

161
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:58,039
holistically was was in this particular

162
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:02,329
course because students see everything

163
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:06,048
from agricultural inputs on

164
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:09,769
a lot of time on farms processing value

165
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:12,948
addition and so on in in food and and

166
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:17,298
now in textiles as well human ecology as

167
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:24,919
a as a cohort of of textile students to

168
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:28,068
travel with us local contacts allow us

169
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:32,628
to get to places that we we wouldn't get

170
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:36,428
to if we were just touring we get into

171
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:40,159
rural houses small farms businesses

172
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:42,798
farmers oftentimes there are instructors

173
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,659
or local researchers and development

174
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:48,708
practitioners there are expert resource

175
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:52,039
persons learning from peers the Cornell

176
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:54,318
students will when we go to India and in

177
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,349
January they'll be learning from the 15

178
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:59,058
students in their faculty who are here

179
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,579
right now and we hope that the students

180
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:03,350
that are here for the next two weeks

181
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:05,568
will learn from from our students as

182
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,058
well learn something about American

183
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:11,360
agriculture and food system so there's

184
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:15,828
that reciprocity also among faculty

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:23,678
faculty we learn from counterparts from

186
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:26,448
India Myanmar and it's very a very

187
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:27,769
experiential form of learning you know

188
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:31,008
they're not over there sitting in a

189
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:34,639
classroom they're over there in the

190
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:38,389
field speaking with with farmers

191
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:42,168
researchers practitioners as I mentioned

192
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:48,168
the the class structure it's it's a full

193
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:50,208
year course we have resource persons

194
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:52,278
that come during the preliminary the

195
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,798
preparatory course so for example last

196
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,230
year a year ago right now we were

197
00:10:54,798 --> 00:11:03,048
preparing to go this past January to

198
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:06,678
Myanmar and one of the guest presenters

199
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:11,749
for our fall class that we were able to

200
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:14,899
attract to campus for two days with our

201
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:16,100
students and faculty was the first US

202
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,589
ambassador to me

203
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,670
who had you know us hadn't had

204
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:26,540
diplomatic relations for decades during

205
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:31,698
the military regime regime in in Myanmar

206
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:34,789
so Derek Mitchell came in and spent a

207
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:38,120
significant time with us in giving a

208
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:40,549
sort of a front-row seat perspective to

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,679
the changes that have taken place over

210
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:51,528
the last four or five years in Myanmar

211
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:55,698
the students do a lot of sharing of

212
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:58,278
their international experiences as I

213
00:11:55,698 --> 00:12:01,639
mentioned before when we're in country

214
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,370
or when they're visiting us we spend

215
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,889
some time on campuses and in the field

216
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,019
together we have Humphrey fellows almost

217
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:13,549
every year that that participate they're

218
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:16,490
mid-career professionals and then after

219
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:19,068
the January field trip we continue on

220
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:25,909
with a spring semester course and the

221
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:28,909
students write papers together and this

222
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:30,919
past year those group papers several

223
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:35,230
were submitted to the Cornell policy

224
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,229
review and will be published this fall

225
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,850
so just a couple minutes about India you

226
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:49,338
know we we know that it's it's the

227
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,060
world's largest democracy it's really

228
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,339
wrestling with its its own identity in

229
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:59,059
many ways and its own development

230
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:02,990
trajectory soon to be the most populous

231
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:07,789
country in the world oh just about 1.3

232
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,829
billion people so more than one out of

233
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:16,549
every six people that walk on this earth

234
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:18,859
is from India millions of farmers the

235
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:21,309
last census that I saw agricultural

236
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,620
census in India had the number of

237
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:29,659
individual farms that I think around 120

238
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:34,389
million and most of those

239
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:40,610
small or marginal farms in terms of size

240
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:45,230
and a fair amount even though it's got a

241
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:47,659
very large and rapidly growing middle

242
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:53,870
class which a lot of Americans don't

243
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:56,389
realize it also has you know large

244
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,948
amount of rural poverty and food

245
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:04,639
insecurity a few statistics they

246
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:07,849
certainly don't tell the whole story I

247
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,560
think another thing we know about India

248
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,810
in this country or we read about here

249
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,318
about in the media is that it's an

250
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,609
established global leader in information

251
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:23,328
communication technology computer

252
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:27,649
software and just bring to your

253
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:30,169
attention you know some some differences

254
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,879
in in GDP the thing that strikes our

255
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,889
students when they go to India is that

256
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,458
second set of things that are circled

257
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:41,389
density you know when our students go to

258
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:44,929
India they almost invariably remarked

259
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:48,799
about the number of people if you come

260
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:51,649
from upstate New York I happen to come

261
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,778
from a county in north central

262
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,350
Pennsylvania in the Allegheny plateau I

263
00:14:53,778 --> 00:15:00,799
still have a farm in that area and the

264
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:07,100
population density there is four people

265
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:09,438
per square kilometer and in India is

266
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,199
four hundred and ten and in parts of

267
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:16,879
India like Oda Pradesh it's probably 12

268
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:22,008
or 1300 or something like that so it's a

269
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:26,838
very densely populated country it's a

270
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:30,199
young population thus the rapid increase

271
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,660
in in population if we look back just in

272
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,129
1960 that seems like ancient history to

273
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,588
the students in here it doesn't seem

274
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:41,328
like ancient history to to Marvin and me

275
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:44,100
but 1960 the population was under five

276
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:46,559
hundred thousand five hundred million

277
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,889
and now it's about one and a third

278
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:56,389
billion so very rapidly growing

279
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:59,939
population a large rural population and

280
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:01,919
the the thing about obesity one of the

281
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,110
things that's changing there and it's

282
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,719
got the attention of a lot of people in

283
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:11,639
in the field of nutrition is this

284
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,840
so-called double burden of malnutrition

285
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:19,799
as a as countries have a growing middle

286
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:24,840
class as India does middle-class people

287
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:29,459
eat differently than poor people and so

288
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:33,050
we're seeing fairly rapid increases in

289
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:39,810
obesity and in many developing countries

290
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:44,639
as the middle class grows and let me

291
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:46,229
just point out in closing that this is

292
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,689
the the area of India

293
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,090
Marvin's going to speak to Myanmar this

294
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,450
is the area of India that we've been

295
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,960
working in no we have students here

296
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,820
today that are from Assam up here in the

297
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,040
Northeast how many raise your hands if

298
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,880
you from us um they're from Assam

299
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,139
Agricultural University up there and

300
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,970
students raise your hands if you're from

301
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,470
University of Agricultural Sciences and

302
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:17,370
dharwad okay that's in Karnataka known

303
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,410
in this area and so those are our

304
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,349
partners this year those were our

305
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:27,089
partners a couple years ago the last

306
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:29,549
time we we went to India and so in

307
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:31,230
January of this year we'll be in that

308
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,889
area for about two and a half weeks I'm

309
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:39,299
going to stop there and Marvin's going

310
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:42,690
to talk about me and Mark so the other

311
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:44,519
place that we go as a class which used

312
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,430
to be called Burma and it used to be the

313
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,900
breadbasket of Southeast Asia and one of

314
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,110
the reasons is it just has an incredible

315
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,060
climate from you know tropical sea level

316
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:56,369
environments to mountains where you can

317
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,879
grow apples and cool season crops lots

318
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:00,899
of why

319
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,880
in soil resources but now it has the

320
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,550
lowest yields per acre of any Southeast

321
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,750
Asian country and I'll tell you why in a

322
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,980
second it's primarily now a rice based

323
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,869
diet that people we people he does eat

324
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,059
rice all the time and there's not a lot

325
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:18,479
of diversity there and very low levels

326
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,909
of fruit and vegetable consumption part

327
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,319
of the reason for this poor performance

328
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,210
of crops and diet that's not very strong

329
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,579
is because of the government and this

330
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,309
situation that happened after the

331
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:34,949
British they got independence in 1948

332
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,500
from the Brits but then there was a coup

333
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,630
in 1962 kind of took over the country

334
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,759
for about 50 years very strong

335
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,790
centralized military dictatorship that

336
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,589
told people if you want to go land or

337
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,879
you O'Bannon's land you have to grow

338
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,409
rice because they didn't want people

339
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,170
starving a didn't want a revolt

340
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,180
so you rule with an iron fist and they

341
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,730
rule for a long time and that was when

342
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,890
she was in prison and you got the Nobel

343
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,349
Peace Prize and all that a lot of strife

344
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,660
in that country as recently as two

345
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,579
thousand club there was a ceasefire with

346
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,500
Qin state which is one of the several

347
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:09,809
states in Myanmar but is continuously

348
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,819
ethnic violence in bikinis Davis or

349
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,869
hinga people as you read about it could

350
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,399
chin and Shan State

351
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,469
there's gonna go on for years and years

352
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
we're just now hearing about George

353
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,150
Engle people but that's been going on

354
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,259
for for quite a while but the military

355
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,820
government allowed elections in 2016 the

356
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,220
first non-military

357
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:32,609
leader was installed but in the truth

358
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,950
the civilian leaders does not control

359
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:36,719
the military the military still control

360
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,090
several ministries they also have a

361
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,740
guarantee number of seats in Congress so

362
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,750
the military even though it looks like

363
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,509
on the surface is a democratically

364
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,190
elected government then you know we pull

365
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,710
back some of the sanctions and so forth

366
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,110
to help that the military still rules of

367
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,809
the iron fist and still it's causing

368
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:57,299
trouble over a routine state here's

369
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,609
where Myanmar is it's next to India and

370
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,149
it borders Bangladesh in India to the

371
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:04,829
north China and Laos and Thailand but

372
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,600
that's how long it's almost like Chile

373
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:10,049
where it's it's really long country with

374
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,619
a lot of different growing regions and

375
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,169
all kinds of

376
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:16,319
fruits can be grown there but the

377
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,670
problem is it's also a very poor country

378
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:23,159
and if you look at the income per worker

379
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,410
farm worker in Myanmar it's way way down

380
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,150
at the bottom people just don't make a

381
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,370
lot of money I was a high rate of

382
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,690
poverty and a lot of children

383
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,969
underweight because they don't get

384
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:38,009
enough protein and or dye or fruits and

385
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:40,680
vegetables because they so much rice the

386
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,879
yields per acre are very low in

387
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,429
Myanmar's I mentioned earlier here's

388
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,070
some examples of tomato yields if you

389
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,470
look at what the yield is in Myanmar

390
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:53,869
compared to California like four times

391
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,220
less same way with cabbage watermelon

392
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:58,799
lettuce asparagus you know you just

393
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,390
don't produce the yields that we do us a

394
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,220
lot of is because they don't have good

395
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,650
water systems for irrigation they don't

396
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,500
have good fertilizer sources so their

397
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,150
production is really low and people

398
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,160
don't eat a lot of this stuff anyway

399
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,720
when they grow it so this is fruit

400
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,730
consumption and all these other

401
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,730
Southeast Asian countries this is a

402
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,490
global consumption of fruit per capita

403
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,170
on average almost 80 kilograms per

404
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,009
person per year and look down here is me

405
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,690
mr yeah less than 20 and as I suppose is

406
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,119
the same way even when you're provided

407
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,039
the culture is we don't need fruits and

408
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,169
vegetables so as a result there's a lot

409
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,789
of malnutrition in Qin state I know that

410
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:41,850
rate of childhood stunting is around 40%

411
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:43,349
it's really really high they have a

412
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:45,569
strained infrastructure this is the

413
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:49,109
major this is the one agricultural

414
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:51,389
university in Myanmar and this is a

415
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:53,279
department of horticulture building the

416
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,100
main university they also have these 14

417
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,349
AG institutions scattered around the

418
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,629
country and this is one of them and

419
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:03,269
there's a reported Horticulture

420
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:07,110
Department and here's a photo from one

421
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:09,599
of the labs and that's what it looks

422
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:12,209
like so there they're really there's a

423
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,859
long way to go there for them and it's

424
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,250
really difficult to come in to help

425
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,049
because it's still so centrally managed

426
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,019
that for us to even go there and visit

427
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,329
we had to get a letter from the capital

428
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,398
city granting us permission to go and

429
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:28,408
and then when we ask to borrow the

430
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:30,058
curriculum to look at they had to make a

431
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,950
bunch of phone calls to get permission

432
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,750
even give us the first-year curriculum

433
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,519
like this is the list of courses the

434
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,500
students had to have because they were

435
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,839
afraid of doing something that wouldn't

436
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,269
be in line with the central government's

437
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,658
wishes so it's a incredibly wonderful

438
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:49,259
people very friendly but very

439
00:22:44,659 --> 00:23:27,870
challenging to work in here's a some of

440
00:22:49,259 --> 00:23:31,919
the roads they give money anything they

441
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:33,119
have to these magnificent abilities so

442
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,860
when the students are there they're

443
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,619
confronted with all kinds of issues and

444
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:40,019
so the questions that were we asked them

445
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,058
to answer and write papers about are

446
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,909
these complicated questions you know

447
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:47,308
they're not just specific like all for

448
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,889
example Carey meant to this 120 million

449
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:52,109
number of farmers in this country how do

450
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:55,589
you kind of extension reach 120 million

451
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:57,418
people yeah how do you promote

452
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:58,918
mechanization in a country where if you

453
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,929
put people out of work what are they

454
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,820
gonna do you know all kinds of

455
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,419
interesting really challenging questions

456
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:07,619
and the list goes on how do you promote

457
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:09,990
more fruit and vegetable consumption in

458
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,398
a place like Myanmar when we know that

459
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,058
they need it but the culture doesn't

460
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:17,939
really embrace it how do you how do we

461
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,158
scientists talk to people in places

462
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,130
where they use these alternative methods

463
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,139
to grow food crops like Vedic practices

464
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,460
a chant they use phases of the Moon and

465
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:29,129
those of us from a Western perspective

466
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,409
we say well that might not be you know

467
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,820
what we would do but you've got to be

468
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:35,340
respectful people who've been doing this

469
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,259
for seven thousand years right so

470
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,099
there's all kinds of challenges that our

471
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:42,599
students get it

472
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:45,299
she has to face and do it so how's this

473
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,909
trip affect students individually we're

474
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,299
gonna have a Marcus share his experience

475
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,420
gone on a trip last year to Myanmar okay

476
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:56,789
all right so I had the pleasure of going

477
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,210
on the trip to Myanmar with Cavey Terry

478
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:02,220
and Marvin and I was asked to just kind

479
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,039
of give my perspective as they already

480
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,509
mentioned we wrote a paper I was a part

481
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,359
of a three-person group who wrote a

482
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:11,129
paper dealing with issues of extension

483
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,729
and infrastructure that's getting

484
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,560
published and for me to talk about the

485
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,360
impact it had on me I want to just talk

486
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,940
about three things that I really noticed

487
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,099
when I was in Myanmar when we were

488
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,980
visiting all these different small

489
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,379
villages and farmers and also just

490
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,849
getting to know the students you guys

491
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,900
are really lucky that you're here now to

492
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:35,309
meet with the students that you'll be

493
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,580
travelling with that was something that

494
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,929
I had wished we had been able to do

495
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,279
because by the time we started

496
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,580
connecting with the students that seems

497
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,089
like our trip was already over so for me

498
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:50,309
I really appreciated the work ethic that

499
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:52,679
all the students had it really struck a

500
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:56,639
chord with me because they're not only

501
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,220
taking full class load credits wise and

502
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,120
trying to become a plant breeders plant

503
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,370
geneticists when they're first

504
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,059
generation students but they're also

505
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:11,489
doing so with all their books being in

506
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:15,389
English not even the language they're

507
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,519
primarily speaking so I knew for me it

508
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,350
really made me think about how I've had

509
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,809
so many hard classes here as a Cornell

510
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:24,599
student I can imagine trying to learn

511
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,849
plant physiology or like plant genetics

512
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,619
in Burmese I just it was really

513
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:30,299
impressive to like see how hard that

514
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,449
they are all working to better their

515
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:36,990
community the second thing that I really

516
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,090
noticed was just and they kind of

517
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,240
touched on this the lack of information

518
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:44,659
in infrastructure for information so

519
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,279
many of the villages we visited had

520
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:51,880
maybe one person had a cell phone that

521
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,639
they could run on a generator to charge

522
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,950
like here I can just Google anything

523
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,730
like it's weird when I don't have access

524
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:02,410
to sir internet or you know resources

525
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,599
such as Marvin and Terry I can literally

526
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,700
walk I literally weekly walk into

527
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,178
Marvin's office sometimes just ask him a

528
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,620
question

529
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:14,259
so I really was that was something I

530
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:16,719
really wanted to make sure that I did

531
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:19,779
better was utilizing the access to

532
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,569
education and like public sources as a

533
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,558
Cornell student and then the final thing

534
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:28,689
and they this was also touched on was

535
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,548
every village we went to even though

536
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:34,320
they might have been growing rice to

537
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:38,200
sell that was more nutritious

538
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,210
nutritionally dense or better for you

539
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,130
nutritionally they were all all the

540
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,288
farmers grew their own landrace

541
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,299
varieties and we're so proud of it and

542
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:50,349
that pride in like what they were

543
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:53,259
growing and the education what education

544
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:55,359
they had access to via extension agents

545
00:27:53,259 --> 00:28:00,700
even if it was limited they were super

546
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:05,949
proud of being able to like contour farm

547
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:07,690
on a hillside or grow ginseng to sell at

548
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,400
market but at the same time they were

549
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,419
super proud of what they were growing

550
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,880
and would feed us their rice and it was

551
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:19,419
just a really humbling experience to see

552
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,100
how proud they were of it and it kind of

553
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:25,480
like really resonated with me like I

554
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:28,750
want to I guess our takeaway is for me I

555
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,779
really want to be more engaged in the

556
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:34,419
communities I'm in as a senior in plant

557
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,908
science I'm a peer mentor to five new

558
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:40,030
students and it's a really unique

559
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,390
opportunity to give back and I kind of

560
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:45,250
think that before this trip I would have

561
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,860
said oh yeah peer mentoring is a great

562
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,599
idea someone should do that but after

563
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,308
the trip like getting to know these

564
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,129
students who all they want to do is like

565
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:56,558
learn to then give back really was a

566
00:28:54,130 --> 00:29:00,100
catalyst for me to want to do just that

567
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:03,970
and that also with our publication in

568
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:05,349
the fall we tackled different aspects

569
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,579
like we had what

570
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:12,129
fifteen students or how many groups we

571
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:13,869
headed six different groups of varying

572
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,090
lengths varying subjects and that's a

573
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:18,519
really also unique opportunity to work

574
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,918
with people who weren't necessarily in

575
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,160
your major or like have a different

576
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:28,390
perspective to also then give back to a

577
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,179
community and kind of the final thing is

578
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,520
just realizing like yeah I feel busy as

579
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,400
a student here everyone does but there's

580
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,819
always that like extra half hour hour I

581
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,070
can carve out of my day to either work

582
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,589
on my personal relationships with other

583
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:47,500
students or professional relationships

584
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:50,859
with professors - I guess catalyze

585
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,349
change so that's pretty much my five

586
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:55,149
minutes and what Marcus didn't say is a

587
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:56,859
lot of these countries the students in

588
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,179
college they get up at 6:00 in the

589
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,250
morning and do a couple of hours of

590
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:02,259
field work before they go to class they

591
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,909
come back in the afternoon and finish up

592
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,890
the field work so you got a real

593
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:09,429
experimental learning but it's very hard

594
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,630
work and pretty amazing so quickly at

595
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:12,669
the finish I'm going to just show you a

596
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,320
bunch of slides really quickly India how

597
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:15,038
we travel by bus sometimes they travel

598
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,470
by train

599
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,140
India is a very beautiful country in

600
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,579
many places but I want you to notice

601
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,169
it's a little bit hazy and there's this

602
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:27,490
layer here of smog and for those of us

603
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:29,500
for the states where we're used to

604
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,849
pretty clear skies you know it's pretty

605
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,769
hazy and a lot of is because there's

606
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:34,689
still a lot of burning that goes on in

607
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,450
India and a lot of garbage is burn and

608
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,048
wood fires it creates a haze over much

609
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,700
of the country

610
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:42,069
there's also we're not used to seeing

611
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,110
your sewage along the roads and we all

612
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:46,389
have very strong regulations about that

613
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:50,859
in India that's not the case but also

614
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:53,679
the very beautiful places palaces it's

615
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:55,629
also very crowded as Terry said lots of

616
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,320
people I'm gonna show you a little just

617
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,320
a little example

618
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:08,179
[Applause]

619
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,079
[Music]

620
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:13,830
students in India might say what's the

621
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,480
big deal but for us it's car this is

622
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,769
this is one of the best nice everybody

623
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,089
remember that one of the first video

624
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:33,778
games that came out was called Frogger

625
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:35,278
about watch you stop there for us it's

626
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:38,460
just pretty amazing we'd wait to like to

627
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,750
change the crosswalk so a lot of wealth

628
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,360
in India we don't think of India

629
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,159
necessary but this is a wedding that was

630
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,750
going outside one of the hotels you

631
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,570
stayed in it was like a three-day affair

632
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:52,378
and a very elaborate with the stage and

633
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:54,119
all that teri mentioned water a lot of

634
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:57,480
farmers pull water out of these bore

635
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,939
holes or they carry water from a central

636
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,808
spot a lot of time spent carrying water

637
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,850
a typical farm in India you know few

638
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:11,128
cows and chickens everybody has a

639
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:14,609
motorcycle to get around there women

640
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:17,009
lots of different crops some of the

641
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:19,168
faces of some of the people I wanted you

642
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:21,628
to notice this feel of tomatoes here

643
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:23,370
there's some women picking tomatoes and

644
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:24,750
there's this fella here he's sitting in

645
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,028
the ground under the tree and again one

646
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:29,220
of the things is really hard for us for

647
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:31,200
this country to kind of accept these big

648
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,169
strong gender roles so these women

649
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,649
around the hot Sun picking the tomatoes

650
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:36,960
carrying aback

651
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:39,359
you know now he's leaning down taking it

652
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,100
out it's getting hot hot out there she's

653
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,589
in the shade tree and then he sits in

654
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:46,469
counsel Tomatoes that's his job

655
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:48,829
so it's you know here it's a lot more

656
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:52,970
equal in terms of that sense but there's

657
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:57,480
very distinct gender roles here we see

658
00:32:52,970 --> 00:33:05,329
tumeric being harvested I seen that

659
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,329

699
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,818
retired elephants so we're used to being

700
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:04,949
around people and they like to interact

701
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:08,550
with people so I got a chance to climb

702
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:10,769
up in the elephant in Myanmar another

703
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,990
really interesting place Chris Wien who

704
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,280
went with me in April of this year said

705
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:16,649
he's never been to a country where the

706
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,349
people were more uniformly friendly as

707
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,180
Myanmar really incredible a lot of

708
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:25,349
people were this paste on your face it's

709
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:27,269
sandalwood they rub it on her face is

710
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,338
sort of like a sunscreen as a way to

711
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,949
keep the skin looking fresh

712
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:35,009
most of Myanmar's in a Delta region are

713
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:36,298
WA Oddie River runs through there but

714
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,010
there's a lot of mountain regions as

715
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:40,108
well we were there with a class we

716
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,270
mainly stayed in a lower Delta region

717
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:44,250
lots of rice grown but it does have

718
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:47,250
mountains and this is qin state where

719
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,039
it's a lot more mountainous there's our

720
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,409
bus drove around we were at the airport

721
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,509
and mandalay and some guy came running

722
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:56,068
on the bus because i can't believe it on

723
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,960
the Cornell graduate I can't believe it

724
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:59,608
busted for now in front of it it's

725
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,900
really exciting and I want you to notice

726
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:06,838
the license plate here looks like it's

727
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,588
like peed a little bit right so what

728
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,849
happens is in the mr each state has a

729
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:14,009
different license plate a different

730
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,539
color and if you happen to like want to

731
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,780
drive in another state doesn't the right

732
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,858
color you just got the paintbrush

733
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,440
license plate the right color so you

734
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:23,848
don't get stopped by the police and once

735
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,440
in a while on these dirt roads you know

736
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:27,390
something breaks down here's a truck

737
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,190
broke down and we couldn't get through

738
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,779
we had a bus so we all had to get out

739
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,639
and push this truck all the way so he

740
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,530
got through

741
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:38,429
some beautiful pagodas that were built

742
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:46,610
around 1000 AD by the first boost it

743
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:48,419
came in to Myanmar a lot of pagodas

744
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,910
spectacular this one's the Shwedagon

745
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,480
pagoda President Obama went there a

746
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:56,099
couple of years ago on Yan Xiu Qi often

747
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,050

748
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,940
pagoda it's a really incredible

749
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:06,060
beautiful spot a lot of people come

750
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:08,099
there to meditate and pray a lot of the

751
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:10,590
hilltops they're covered with pagodas of

752
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,360
some sort in Myanmar very beautiful and

753
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,579
spectacular again for our students it

754
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,370
was little bit hard to see this

755
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,170
beautiful gold-plated you know pagodas

756
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:20,969
at the same time most of the people in

757
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,170
the country are poor and for a lot of

758
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,819
Buddhists it's like well we don't need

759
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,880
to accumulate a lot of wealth in this

760
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,920
world we'll give it to the monastery for

761
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,430
these pagodas and then we'll be rewarded

762
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,930
in the afterlife with something better a

763
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:36,980
lot of places where women are not

764
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:39,629
allowed to go if you're in Myanmar

765
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,329
here's another sacred place prohibited

766
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:46,410
foreigners I can go female and males

767
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:48,449
under 18 if you do something bad there a

768
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,619
lot of people are literate but you know

769
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:51,449
here's a picture it shows you what

770
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,650
happens if you fool around with another

771
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:57,839
woman you know you got in trouble if you

772
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,369
if you gossip about somebody over there

773
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,430
and you know that will cut your tongue

774
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,259
out and how if you booze it up too much

775
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:07,230
you know you got waterboarded there or

776
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,760
something a lot of interesting stuff one

777
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,500
of the things we a couple of really cool

778
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,600
things we did there was we took hot-air

779
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,179
balloon rides in the morning before the

780
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,259
Sun came up over all those pagodas and

781
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,329
you can see all those two gurus out

782
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,250
there and as the sun's coming up and it

783
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:23,239
hits the gold root for the pagodas is

784
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,239
just spectacular beautiful

785
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:35,199
so these animals are being replaced with

786
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,639
some of these crude machines but these

787
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,779
machines can be used for lots of

788
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,159
purposes and they're becoming very

789
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:45,250
popular these are the pull behind

790
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:46,509
tractors this is interesting we if we

791
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,280
were there in the dry season but it

792
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,690
rained one day we were there during dry

793
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,100
season and the growers freaked out and

794
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,960
we went to visit a vineyard to the next

795
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,759
day and they were spraying fungicide

796
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,470
because of rain and look they're just

797
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,590
mixing like whatever they can find

798
00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:03,399
together and better put it up look at

799
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:05,559
this fury Dan out there which we don't

800
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,389
use anymore this fella here was mixing

801
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:09,670
it in his tank and they were pumping it

802
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:12,250
out in the hose and they were hauling

803
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,750
the hose down the row and then somebody

804
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,059
there was the protective equipment on

805
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:21,940
was spraying the initiate gloves was

806
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:25,869
spraying the grates and yeah we would

807
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,090
yep last thing I want to show you is we

808
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,940
went to this inle lake where as a place

809
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,170
that got lots of flooding after

810
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,849
rainfalls and the water level weapon

811
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,940
down and the people's gardens to get

812
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:38,889
flooded out so what they did was they

813
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,650
decided they were gonna move the village

814
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:43,629
to the water and build these mats where

815
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,050
they could put the vegetables on the mat

816
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,340
and when the liquid level would rise the

817
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,980
vegetables would just float up on the

818
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:54,760
mast so we would go through these

819
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:59,730
villages and drive right through the

820
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:03,790
eggplants and the tomatoes to float

821
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:06,639
pretty cool stuff dragon fruit alright

822
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:08,139
so don't tell me times up so we'll stop
