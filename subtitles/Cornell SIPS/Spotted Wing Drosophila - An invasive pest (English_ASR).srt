foreign

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,880
drosophila is a small vinegar fly native

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,039
to Japan it was first seen in the United

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,379
States when it was noted in Hawaii in

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,260
the 1980s the fly reached the mainland

6
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,719
in summer of 2008 when it was brought to

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,880
central California during this first

8
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,058
year spotted Wing caused an estimated

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,219
500 billion dollars in Damages with some

10
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,759
Farmers recording crop losses of up to

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,759
80 percent

12
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,099
fly quickly traveled across the rest of

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,960
the country and is now widespread

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,300
throughout the U.S and has also been

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,859
seen in parts of Europe Australia and

16
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,479
New Zealand have imposed quarantine

17
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,579
restrictions on Washington State

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,500
cherries but as of yet no other

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,239
preventative measures are being taken to

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,659
guard against further spread of this

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:05,659
insect

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,519
spotted Wing was first seen in New York

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,560
in the fall of 2011 but because the fly

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,359
is relatively new to the Northeast their

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,879
damage has been difficult to quantify

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,560
however since we are now aware of the

27
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,179
threat that the fly poses their

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,180
populations are being monitored

29
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,679
spotted Wing is very similar to the

30
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,140
fruit flies that we are all familiar

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,659
with however these slides have a

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,180
serrated ovipositor allowing the females

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,460
to lay eggs in under ripe fruit unlike

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,860
other drosophila species which can only

35
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,859
lay eggs in over ripe or rotting fruit

36
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,798
females can lay up to 16 eggs in one day

37
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,438
and over 300 eggs in their lifetime

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
which can be up to nine weeks long

39
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,339
Studies have shown that up to 13

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,259
generations of flies can be produced per

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,100
year and adults are capable of

42
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,099
overwintering

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,679
a respiratory horn also called a sting

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,500
shown here indicates the of position

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,180
site of the egg eggs hatch within three

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,699
days and larval feeding immediately

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,459
begins adulthood can be reached after

48
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,318
only eight days level feeding causes the

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,120
collapse of fruit tissue leaving The

50
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,098
Telltale indentations and berries

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,259
indicating that the maggots are present

52
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,539
this damage to the skin of the fruit

53
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,679
also makes it vulnerable to bacterial

54
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,679
and fungal infection

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
when fruit that contains these eggs is

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,259
harvested within two days the maggots

57
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,639
will emerge making the product

58
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,639
completely unmarketable

59
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,039
right now the only way to control

60
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,840
spotted Wing is through the use of full

61
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,419
coverage sprays directed towards

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,739
controlling adult populations there is

63
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,539
currently nothing that can be done to

64
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,980
salvage fruit that already contains

65
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,259
developing eggs

66
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,699
sprays must be applied weekly and it is

67
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,439
encouraged to use a variety of

68
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,919
insecticides with different modes of

69
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,840
action as a way of preventing resistance

70
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,939
however this is not the ideal way to

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
control a pest as pesticide application

72
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,158
here is based on a time schedule as

73
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
opposed to an IPM approach this results

74
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,259
in heavy spraying which is both costly

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,639
for farmers and bad for the environment

76
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,620
farmers are also encouraged to closely

77
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,259
monitor their fruit and harvest it

78
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,060
immediately once it reaches ripeness and

79
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,060
also to dispose of infested fruit

80
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,298
the good news is that male flies become

81
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,158
sterile at 30 degrees that New York

82
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,019
State's natural cold temperatures may

83
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,359
help limit their population growth and

84
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,459
protect our fruit as scientists continue

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,560
to study spotted wing drosophila and

86
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,239
make discoveries such as this we will be

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,560
able to develop a better Pest Management

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,560
strategy for the future
