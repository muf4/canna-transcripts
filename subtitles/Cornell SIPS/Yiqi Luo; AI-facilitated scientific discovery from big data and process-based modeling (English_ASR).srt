1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,240
University so today I'm going to talk

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:16,000
about AI facilitate the scientific

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,278
discovery from Big Data and the process

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,640
based

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:26,560
modeling and probably as you may

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:30,719
aware and the AI is a big area it's uh

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:34,640
you know so many different uh method

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:38,200
and so powerful in different areas so

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:44,439
today I just uh want to share the

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:50,320
experience my lab had have and using AI

12
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:54,238
in our research so um today I'm going to

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,359
talk about why we developed a product

14
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,919
which is you know as a AI modeling tool

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,559
and how we use the

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,000
to understand the mechanisms underlying

17
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,879
soil carbon storage and to understand

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,040
the

19
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,399
climatological temperature

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:18,118
sensitivity of soil organic carbon along

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,560
soil profile now my lab is developing a

22
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,759
so- called be bio uh biog geochemistry

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,040
informed neural network as another AI

24
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:32,478
modeling tool so uh in each of the

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,560
slides I have bottom to indicate the

26
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:39,200
different part of my

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,640
talk and uh probably most of us has been

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:48,520
influenced so much by like chat GTP

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:52,399
regarding AI uh AI method and a chart

30
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:55,560
GTP basically is used soal Foundation

31
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,399
models which is which are pre-trained

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,399
with massive data sets and then when

33
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,118
user

34
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,039
to make a question or make request to

35
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,159
chat

36
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,479
GTP and then the chat GTP will use the

37
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,959
new data sets relevant data set to that

38
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,719
particular questions to Def find tuning

39
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,800
before they make um you know answer your

40
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:26,439
questions so so the Char

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,000
GTP uh what there are many of those soal

42
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:34,479
language large language models available

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,318
those larg language models require lots

44
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:41,000
of data when we use it most the time we

45
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:45,158
used as a blackbox

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,280
model and you know the these kind of for

47
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:52,000
AI tools can generate results that may

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,400
not physically or biologically

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,439
consistent with our understanding so ai2

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,120
without clear mechanistic understanding

51
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,400
might not not effectively help us to

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,120
understand the

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:13,840
science and but you know last year two

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,879
Nobel prizes awarded to physics I in

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:22,158
physics and chemistry to do scientist to

56
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:25,199
make a great contribution to advances in

57
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:28,039
in in chemistry and physics and

58
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,560
especially like the the the award in

59
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:36,680
chemistry they certainly can use the AI

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:41,438
to advance science so it's and uh

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:45,519
particularly the uh know professor John

62
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:48,759
hopfield re recently made a notes that

63
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,599
basically he think that word is

64
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:56,598
understandable and uh he he said that

65
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,078
you should be able to take anything

66
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,438
apart understand the relationship

67
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,519
between it

68
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,759
constituents do experiments on that

69
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,438
basis to be able to develop a

70
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:13,878
quantitative understanding of its

71
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:18,000
behavior and uh so so how to use the AI

72
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:21,839
as a scientific tool it's a major uh

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,240
issues we have been thinking about today

74
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,879
I'm going to

75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:31,038
introduce a ai2 my lab has developed a

76
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,879
So-Cal proda that that's basically

77
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:38,079
combine process based

78
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:42,199
modeling and the neural network and also

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:45,439
data assimilation approach process based

80
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,639
model is used a lot of understanding

81
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,519
about process and the neuron and the the

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:57,280
machine learning most the time used as a

83
00:04:52,519 --> 00:05:00,319
tool for data mining and then the the

84
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,559
product the tool we have developed is

85
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,319
try to combine the best order for that

86
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,600
ability capability of data mining

87
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,120
through machine learning and the process

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,039
based

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:19,519
understandings now I discuss why we

90
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:23,079
developed this approach holda as a as a

91
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,758
tool to understanding we we try to

92
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,918
understand the so carbon Dynamic

93
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,759
probably as as many of you know the so

94
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:36,318
is so critical for agriculture and now

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:40,520
also so critical for carbon sration

96
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:44,720
towards the so-call climate smart smart

97
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:48,439
agriculture so so how to predict the so

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:54,000
carbon Dynamic and storage is a major

99
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:56,918
issue and in this figure on the Y AIS is

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,199
a model predicted the soal carbon

101
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:04,680
density from 11 models that was used in

102
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,800
the ipcc fifth

103
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,879
assessment and xais is observation based

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:17,280
so carbon density so you can see from

105
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:21,439
this figure that if the model can

106
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,598
predict a so carbon density well enough

107
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:29,639
then most of those dots supposed to be

108
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:31,598
scattered around the one to one line but

109
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,199
but you can see from this figure the

110
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:37,680
model basically has no ideas what's what

111
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,879
happening in the real

112
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,800
world this uncertainty in model Earth

113
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:48,399
system modeling actually propagates to

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,079
the uh through those prediction

115
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:55,560
regarding the land carbon sink and the

116
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:58,918
CL climate uh Dynamics so this is one of

117
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,360
the one of the three major sources that

118
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,000
caus that

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,400
uncertainty in future climate

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,560
prediction so my love has been try

121
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:15,000
to understand and try to

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,280
improve how we can predict so carbon

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,240
Dynamic well and in order to predict

124
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:26,638
soil carbon or any any you know anything

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,598
if we want to make a moreel more make

126
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,360
more realistic prediction we need a

127
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:36,478
perfect model structure perfect model

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,800
parameterization and also forcing

129
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:45,240
variables so my has examed all those

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:49,439
three elements and one by one first we

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,038
developed a framework to unify all the

132
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,079
land carbon cycle and the nitrogen and

133
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:58,439
fast for models use a

134
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,519
matric equations as long as those model

135
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,439
use so called po on the fluxes

136
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:07,680
structures so we can unify all of them

137
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:10,360
so so basically we studied the the the B

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,840
of models try to understand what's the

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,038
fundamental principles underline them

140
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,439
and then we discovered that no matter

141
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:24,038
what kind of model structure as long as

142
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,800
they use the socalled flexus uh schemes

143
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:30,079
and all the model can be represented by

144
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,038
these matric equations that's counts

145
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:37,759
carbon input into the system and then

146
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:41,199
this is a carbon Dynamic basically

147
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:44,120
carbon transformation in the system and

148
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,080
also including release from the system

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:52,399
so basically this is a matric equation

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:56,399
we have converted about four 40 models

151
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,278
and to into MRI form and also another

152
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,480
group from um M plank in Institute in

153
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:06,278
Germany they also converted about the 20

154
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,839
nonlinear microbial model into this

155
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:13,200
matric form so now we have the once we

156
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,680
have the unified framework we can study

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:21,360
models at different level of complexity

158
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:27,078
under one overarching Theory and uh here

159
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,680
is the examples and the the

160
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,359
national anchor National Cent for

161
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,759
atmospheric research they developed the

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,919
So-Cal Community Land model with carbon

163
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,879
nitrogen Dynamics this is probably

164
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,719
literally is one of the most complicated

165
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,838
model in the whole world they used about

166
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,759
nearly one thousands of pools to

167
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,959
describe carbon nitrogen Dynamics and

168
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:56,958
use of six you know six modules to

169
00:09:52,958 --> 00:10:00,199
describe them now my lab have converted

170
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:04,359
into two equations for carbon and

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,600
nitrogen Cycles in vegetation and soil

172
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:12,320
and once we converted to two equations

173
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,680
this this structure become highly mod

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,200
modular and we can make much more

175
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:23,359
powerful diagnostic capacity we make the

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:29,079
spin up much faster faster by about 50

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:33,480
times so once we converted to the this

178
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:35,359
uh unified framework now we can pinpoint

179
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,920
sources of model

180
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,079
uncertainties in this particular studies

181
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:47,000
we study we used eight models and

182
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:51,359
ranging from 10 model with two pool

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,879
versus or model from France France

184
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,079
that's with a 100

185
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:59,879
one the pools no matter how how

186
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,078
complicated or

187
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,399
the the complexity we can all represent

188
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:09,759
the different models in one

189
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,958
unified frame basically model structure

190
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:17,240
is the same so once we represented all

191
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:18,919
those model struct uh all the model in

192
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,560
the same

193
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:27,559
framework then we we did the experiment

194
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:32,679
so we used these eight models and feed

195
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:35,319
the same same forcing and also gpp and

196
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,759
then we find out that actually more

197
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,200
under the among the models that the

198
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:48,000
uncertainties diverges as time goes so

199
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,720
next since now we have unified framework

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,200
now we can

201
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,759
standardize the parameter of eight

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:00,079
models and then we can shrink these

203
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:04,439
model uncertainties to zero so so what

204
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:06,879
that mean those study that means this

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,639
simulation modeling approach that has

206
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,360
been used by Community for 60 years so

207
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,720
the the

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,759
the the simulation modeling approach

209
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
basically we develop the model by G

210
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:27,039
structure and then we assign the model

211
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:30,039
at the Primal value and use metadata to

212
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,559
drive to predict so those simulation

213
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,759
modeling does not use much data to

214
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:39,958
improve model parameter parameterization

215
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:43,879
so that lead to the divergency model

216
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:47,278
predictions so next step we we use the

217
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,439
soal data assimilation try to understand

218
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,679
how model parameterization will

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,760
influence model Dynamic now many people

220
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,879
use the digital T to describe this data

221
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:04,278
assimilation approach basically try to

222
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:09,958
use the model mimic the real world as

223
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:13,399
much as we can so so data simulation the

224
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:17,159
idea is we are not only need the model

225
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:19,879
structure but we also use the relevant

226
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:23,879
observations through data assimilation

227
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:27,679
to estimate the parameter make the model

228
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,639
to predict the real world phenomena as

229
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,239
much as we uh you know as we can so

230
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:38,039
that's basically that's why the Dig T

231
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,120
came from the prediction my lab has been

232
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:46,360
doing this since about 20 years ago my

233
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,879
first poster I hired to do this is 203

234
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:54,240
to 205 AT Regional scales and in the

235
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,439
past about 20 I mean the especially

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,639
first 15 years we did a variety of

237
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,519
analysis use this digital TN techniques

238
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:09,600
and certainly we improved this model

239
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,519
prediction um very much I mean lot the

240
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,639
residue decreased the special

241
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,919
representation of the soil carbon

242
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:20,278
improved but the still the accuracy is

243
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:23,919
not ideal the accuracy CH you know

244
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:27,519
improved to like about R square of

245
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:31,519
point4 but still no matter what we do

246
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,198
still we not cannot improve them further

247
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,759
so then we analyze we thinking about

248
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:40,399
this issue why you know once we use the

249
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,959
data the digital TN still cannot perform

250
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:48,120
well enough so we we try to understand

251
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:50,799
the reason basically the parameter value

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,600
in those models in those Earth System

253
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:58,399
model at the global scale assume to be

254
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,199
constant over space and the time and but

255
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,198
actually this assumption may be

256
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:08,799
problematic this assumption works for

257
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:13,078
model to be used at the local scale for

258
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:16,120
short term it's fine but once we do the

259
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:19,239
longterm and the large scale simulation

260
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,000
it may not uh not works basically

261
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,240
parameter in the models is represent the

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,120
property of those processes and for

263
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,720
example the soil property and the

264
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,120
microbial dynamic in Isa in the model

265
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,360
it's assumed the same as in Africa or

266
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,519
South America so this is you know bi

267
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,278
biologically or ecologically doesn't

268
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,318
make sense but the currently model still

269
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,799
make those assumptions so once we

270
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:54,679
realize that and we propose that we

271
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:58,000
really need especially on a temporary

272
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:02,719
varying parameter in order to make the

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,600
digital TN works well so that's how we

274
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,120
incorporate the Deep learning into this

275
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,120
our scheme to develop we developed the

276
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,159
So-Cal process guided deep learning on

277
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,120
the data during the modeling and the

278
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:23,679
basically at the data simulation

279
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,679
approach we add the Deep learning so now

280
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:30,919
you can see we used about

281
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:35,000
60,000 of vertical profile of soal

282
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:39,519
carbon worldwide and put into this

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,039
product now we get the the the the the

284
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,480
uh R square

285
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:50,120
62 so this is uh this R square accuracy

286
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,680
is very close very similar to this

287
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,919
machine learning without any process

288
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:59,039
basically socalled soil mapping people

289
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,719
use soil mapping that's very use the

290
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:06,038
neural network without any process so

291
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:11,120
this is is accuracy it's a it's almost

292
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:14,318
Reach the the level that we uh so far we

293
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:18,918
cannot do much at the the at least at

294
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:22,359
the global scale so so now hopefully now

295
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:28,240
I introduced uh basically discussed the

296
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:32,678
why we used this introduced the AI uh AI

297
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,440
uh modeling tools to do uh to combine

298
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:39,960
the process understanding and the data

299
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,400
mining so first issue we try to address

300
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,640
the use this U method is so-called

301
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,720
microbia to evaluate microbial rule in

302
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,880
so carbon organic carbon formation and

303
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:58,038
the persistent and recently the so

304
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,720
scientist and uh led by mro schimid and

305
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:04,599
uh um

306
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,519
uh the johannas also contributed to this

307
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:12,079
paper the new framework emphasize the

308
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:16,400
the rule of microb and mineral in soil

309
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:18,918
organic uh formation and the persistence

310
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,519
but we still need to find a way to

311
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,520
evaluate the relative importance of

312
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:28,759
various process in soil so in this

313
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:32,639
particular study we first defin soal

314
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:36,759
mobial carbon use efficiency as biomass

315
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:40,320
microbial biomass produced divided by

316
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:42,440
substrate uptate and this actually

317
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:47,158
microbial carbon use

318
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:51,159
efficiency has represent the Dual rules

319
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:55,440
so one point is micob consume the soil

320
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:59,799
organic substrate for to get energy and

321
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:03,400
growth and also the M soil iob also

322
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:07,558
contribute to soil organic substrate so

323
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,759
the relative rule relative importance of

324
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:14,440
those two rules and might determine the

325
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,519
how soil organic carbon formation and

326
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,000
the

327
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:23,079
persistance so one hypothesis in the

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,400
floating in the literature is that the

329
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:31,000
higher carbon use efficiency will lead

330
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,798
to the appr of s organic carbon storage

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,279
as long as the the the microbial carbon

332
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:42,000
use deficiency stimulate microbial

333
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:45,119
biomass and necromass formation and then

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,720
contribute the soil organic carbon but

335
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:52,759
also the other ideas has been greatly

336
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,319
discussed in the literature that if

337
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:58,759
microbial carbon use deficiency

338
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:01,599
increased and the microbial bomas

339
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:05,158
increase and lead to more actual

340
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,879
cellular enzyme activities actually soil

341
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,159
organic carbon can

342
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:15,440
decrease so as mentioned in our B the

343
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:18,799
product we have modal structures that

344
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,240
represent the microbial activities now

345
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,240
we can test see under what kind of

346
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,798
conditions the soil organic carbon will

347
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,839
increase versus decrease with the micro

348
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,639
be a carbon use efficiency we find out

349
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:37,798
two critical parameters one is a

350
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:42,038
resonance time for M microb another is

351
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:44,440
resonance time for enzyme and then the

352
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,599
those different parameter will lead to

353
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,320
the different patterns so now the issue

354
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,480
is what the real world the observation

355
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,399
will tell us about those parameter so

356
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:03,120
that's the basically and then if we can

357
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:06,600
use use the real world data to tell us

358
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,798
then we can con can evaluate the

359
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:14,319
relative importance of those Pro those

360
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:17,319
process represented in in this model so

361
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,839
what we did is used as I mentioned we

362
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,678
used the 60,000 vertical soil profile

363
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:27,359
data and

364
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:30,080
to to to to constrain the model and then

365
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,519
we estimate if each of the seven

366
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,199
components that contribute to the soil

367
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,599
organic carbon

368
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,159
storage and then we make the evaluation

369
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,719
to see the their relative importance use

370
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,880
two type of

371
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,200
sensitivity and one type of sensitivity

372
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,240
is soall specially uh same constant

373
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,200
parameter versus variance parameter as I

374
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,159
mentioned to to as I mentioned earlier

375
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
that currently Earth System model all

376
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:07,880
use the constant parameter over the glow

377
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,319
now we estimate the specially variance

378
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,120
parameter so if we use the specially

379
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,960
constant parameter versus variance

380
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,439
parameter we can see that microbial

381
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:25,200
carbon use efficiency has the largest

382
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:28,000
impact on the on the simulated carbon we

383
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,679
also did the sensitivity analysis which

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,798
has been done regularly in the modeling

385
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,159
or also indicate microbial carbon use

386
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:42,119
efficiency is most important so we also

387
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,480
use the model generated relationship of

388
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,278
so organic carbon versus microbial

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,839
carbon use efficiency and also

390
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:55,599
observation use mod analysis to to to to

391
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:59,038
to basically to verify the model uh

392
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:04,639
predictions so this is basically one of

393
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:08,200
the study we we have done to use this

394
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,320
you know AI facilitate the AI modeling

395
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,798
tools to understand the

396
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:17,519
mechanisms so next we also use this tool

397
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,679
for another study try to understand the

398
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,639
mechanisms so another study we call the

399
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,720
climatological uh temperature

400
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,480
sensitivity for soil organic carbon to

401
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,240
warming so what we did is we first again

402
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:39,159
use this Global database of vertical

403
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:43,120
soal carbon and and then we use use

404
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:47,278
different layer of soil we use each of

405
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:51,558
two cm as so layer and then we get data

406
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:55,079
from this database and then we use this

407
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:58,639
uh uh at each s layer we have soil

408
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,759
organic carbon versus temperature we get

409
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,880
the temperature sensitivity sorry

410
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,079
temperature sensitivity and then use

411
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,799
those different along the different

412
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:14,119
layer we get the observed apparent

413
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:17,558
temperature sensitivity Q10 versus

414
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,959
depths basically this indicate that

415
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:24,158
temperature sensitivity of so organic

416
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,679
carbon at the surface is highest most

417
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:31,039
sensitive and then the towards the Deep

418
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,960
layer sensitivity is very very low so

419
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:37,919
that's basically observation based so

420
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:41,600
now this observation based gradings of

421
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:45,480
temperature sensitivity could caused by

422
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:48,918
lots of mechanisms and very complicated

423
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,880
so now how can we know which mechanisms

424
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:55,159
really influence them in the real world

425
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:59,120
it's very difficult to do experiment and

426
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:02,000
certainly we we need the innovation

427
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,719
Innovative approach to the experiment

428
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,480
but now we have modeling we will see

429
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:13,079
whether we can use model ai ai modeling

430
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:16,159
to help te te that part so this is

431
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,599
observation observe the part apparent

432
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,600
temperature function we use the

433
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:24,599
microbial based model nonlinear model

434
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,918
after the use the data simulation you

435
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:32,639
can see we cannot reproduce that pattern

436
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:35,759
and we we used the CLM model uh and

437
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,278
before product so this pattern also

438
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:43,759
doesn't reproduce but after we use the

439
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:48,200
produ to train the CLM and then we find

440
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:53,158
that pattering it's very very similar so

441
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,720
we now we can use model as digital T to

442
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,919
represent

443
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,720
observation and also we need to make

444
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:04,440
sure that actually the model the

445
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,558
intrinsic parameter the parameter for

446
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,798
intrinsic tempature sensitivity actually

447
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:16,119
relatively constant so this apparent one

448
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:19,240
has a huge depth dependent dependency

449
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:23,000
but the intrinsic one it's more or less

450
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:27,399
constant so this is a huge contrast so

451
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,038
now we have a digital pin to to the real

452
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:33,398
world patter

453
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:36,000
now we can use this digital Tain to to

454
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,199
understand what causes this apparent

455
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,599
temperature sensitivity why do different

456
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,200
from the model intrinsic temp

457
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:48,639
temperature sensitivity use this matric

458
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,480
equation as I mentioned that we use this

459
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,559
matric equation to unify the all the

460
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,000
land carbon cycle models as long as they

461
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:02,359
use the so p and flux structures so in

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,038
these equations there are seven terms I

463
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:10,119
mean there six terms but represent seven

464
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:13,798
uh processes now we can PE tease them

465
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:17,439
apart use processes so what we did the

466
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:21,639
first things we use the

467
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,798
manipulate a parameter matri a a is

468
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,640
basically transformation matrix that's

469
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,440
and another is a k k is uh the

470
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,880
decomposability

471
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:39,960
ma vectors so we make the globally

472
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:45,120
uniformed uh a matric and now we you can

473
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,440
see that once we used the uh globally

474
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:53,959
unified a it's a you know this is the

475
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,480
apparent apparent sensitivity this is

476
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,960
intrinsic now we

477
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:06,720
manipulate the a matric and then we lift

478
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:11,120
this the q1 vertical profile closer to

479
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,798
the intrinsic one now we unify the K

480
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:18,558
separately also make it closer to the

481
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:22,278
intrinsic one but once we unify both A

482
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:26,398
and K actually this very close to the

483
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:29,359
intrinsic one so based on this we can

484
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:32,798
see that prob

485
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,558
those process related to microbial

486
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,240
carbon

487
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,879
transformation and the

488
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,759
absorption and also related to organic

489
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,799
carbon decomposability play the huge

490
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:51,000
rule to influence the the temperature

491
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,720
sensitivity in the real world so we also

492
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,240
manipulate other parameter like water

493
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:01,759
scaler and the depth scaler they do have

494
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:07,038
effect but cannot match the the the the

495
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:10,440
intrinsic one well so here if we unify

496
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:14,879
all this parameter actually the

497
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,519
theoretically we can see this even even

498
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,720
temperature sensitivity could increasing

499
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,839
with the depth so this is opposite from

500
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,440
The observed apparent one so this is a

501
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:32,599
the challenge now now we can use a

502
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:36,080
digital train to try to see what you

503
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:39,558
know the potential mechanisms underline

504
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:43,240
those OB observe the pattern but the

505
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:47,359
challenge is still how to get empirical

506
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:50,440
evidence to support those I AI modeling

507
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,719
analysis so this is the another

508
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,038
challenge so so

509
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,960
now um

510
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:03,200
currently our lab is developing so-call

511
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:08,278
biolog chemistry ined the neural network

512
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,480
by a graduate student how how howy and

513
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:14,759
he's a second year graduate student and

514
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,159
then after he joined our lab he now he

515
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:22,440
put the matric equation into neural

516
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:27,080
network and then this uh this we find

517
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,120
out this the the accuracy is very high

518
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,480
even slightly higher than the product

519
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,959
the computationally much faster than

520
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,519
produ by 50 times and as I mentioned our

521
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,038
metric equation spin up already faster

522
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:45,720
than the regular model by 50 times now

523
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:49,398
this is another 50 times over the 50

524
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:53,480
times so basically now being make the

525
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:58,278
spin up faster by 2,000 more than 2,000

526
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:02,000
times faster than the the current model

527
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:05,480
so this offer the explanatory power and

528
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,558
we try to do the transfer learning try

529
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:13,120
to use this technique for the carbon

530
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:18,119
farming at the at the farm level so let

531
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:20,319
me make a summary you know we by 2017 we

532
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:24,038
identify the issue that's need to be

533
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:27,038
solved by AI we luckily enough recruit a

534
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:30,759
graduate student who developed a product

535
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:33,679
and he used the product to study the

536
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:36,759
microbial uh carbon use efficiency and

537
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,960
the soil organic carbon relationship and

538
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:43,558
he also used this study the model in

539
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:47,319
convergency and another graduate student

540
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:50,720
studed the intrinsic versus app Q now

541
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:53,759
how is developing the being and

542
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,600
currently we have a few postor of

543
00:31:53,759 --> 00:32:00,200
graduate student Now using being to

544
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:03,599
study time course Force Dynamic and

545
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,798
disturbing regime and greenhouse gas

546
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:11,638
emissions so what we have learned in the

547
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:14,599
past is basically AI modeling can enable

548
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:17,439
us to discover mechanisms underly

549
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:21,079
systems behavior from Big Data and a

550
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,360
process based model AI is very powerful

551
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:29,158
to accelerate computational efficiency

552
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:31,879
achieve high accuracy in the model uh

553
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,639
data fitting is basically accuracing in

554
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,600
digital train now and democratize the

555
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:43,079
scientific discovery but AI is a tool

556
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,439
like any other tools and it is powerful

557
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:49,319
only if we can identify scientific

558
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:53,639
issues that need AI to

559
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:58,359
address and uh many people contributed

560
00:32:53,638 --> 00:33:01,879
to our studies I cannot uh you know uh

561
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:06,519
I don't have time to to say each of them

562
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:09,240
we also get fund basically funding from

563
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:13,399
uh AI uh AI

564
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,679
Institute and uh we also supported by AI

565
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:20,678
for science the shim

566
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:25,480
foundation and uh uh s other LTR sit

567
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,320
spru sites funding from uh NSF doe and

568
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,919
the

569
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,839
USDA and also take this opportunity do

570
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,120
some

571
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:37,480
advertisement if any of your student and

572
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:42,599
at Corel you are welcome to join our

573
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:46,120
training course it's free for Corel uh

574
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:49,199
people but uh we do take a little bit of

575
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,959
uh tuition fee for people outside thank

576
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,720
you very

577
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,399
much yeah yeah yeah no problem uh I mean

578
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,399
the uh your presentation is very nice

579
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:02,959
and I'm just wondering in the data data

580
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:07,158
simulation part you mention that the

581
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,838
parameters are constant uh when you uh

582
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,320
apply the data assimilation method in

583
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:17,039
global ass simulation but uh for uh but

584
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,079
I know some um data simulation methods

585
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,279
uh which can also update the parameters

586
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,200
so I just want wondering what's the

587
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,480
difference between uh this methods and

588
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,480
the

589
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,320
product well

590
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,800
uh you said update probably you're

591
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:39,039
talking about like Karma filter yeah

592
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:43,280
Karma fi has been used very widely by

593
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:46,199
engineering uh engineering s

594
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,119
scientists professors I mean the

595
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:53,638
disciplines and uh it's true the comma

596
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:57,079
Fielder is do the time uh you know time

597
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,200
uh up update once you have a have

598
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,519
observation

599
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:06,598
uh along the time so this uh one thing

600
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:10,519
is uh this um comma field probably may

601
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,039
not be use for tool for carbon cycle or

602
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:16,358
broadly speaking biog chemical cycle

603
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,079
research because it's update the state

604
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:21,719
and the parameter at the same times once

605
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,880
you update the state variable sorry this

606
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:28,358
is get to very technical and then then

607
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:33,559
this become um you know the not to get

608
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:36,440
the the mass balanced so so back to the

609
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:39,719
almost all the Earth System model you

610
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,760
still use the constant parameter

611
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:45,959
now oh yeah thank you and another

612
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,800
problem is that um I'm just wondering uh

613
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,960
in uh in the I mean I noticed that you

614
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:57,119
use the um AI model to chain the

615
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,318
parameters to op optimize the parameters

616
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,160
but uh

617
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:03,880
uh you have to get the true value of the

618
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,159
parameter it's very different to get

619
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,838
this data so I'm just wondering how do

620
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,199
you get the uh the

621
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,838
parameters well that's a very important

622
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,399
a very important question and usually

623
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,440
those parameter is not observable in the

624
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,760
real world it's right yeah yeah most of

625
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,440
them so what we can do is we use the

626
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,880
socalled

627
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,200
OS uh this is

628
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,000
observational system simulation

629
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:36,159
experiment uh to test the whether the

630
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,960
method can be authentically reproduced

631
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:44,318
so so o OSS again this is a very

632
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:47,800
technical uh issue and OSS is basically

633
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:51,079
use the model given the parer to use the

634
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,240
model to produce the output and then use

635
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:58,640
the output to train the model again to

636
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,919
see how how accurately the recover the

637
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:06,598
parameter comparing to original

638
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:09,480
parameter so in both both being and the

639
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,920
uh the product we did this

640
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,480
experiment uh okay I understand so you

641
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,519
mean the parameters also be reversed and

642
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,599
then you'll use the this reverse

643
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,960
parameters to validate okay thank you

644
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,480
yeah thank you this a great

645
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,079
question sorry it's a very technical

646
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,358
talk yeah

647
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,560
ich I had a question so you had uh at

648
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,960
one point you were looking at the

649
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,318
microbial parameters and you had

650
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,920
identified that the residence time of

651
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:42,039
the microbial biomass and then the the

652
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,519
residence time of the enzymes were

653
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:48,440
having an impact yeah um were you able

654
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,920
to see which of those two parameters

655
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,400
maybe mattered the most or if if could

656
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,159
you comment on how important those

657
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,960
parameters were for your soil carbon

658
00:37:55,159 --> 00:38:00,799
estimation yeah those uh let me

659
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,800
uh see if I can get back to the slides

660
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,800
and

661
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,720
uh you can see the different combination

662
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:14,680
of those two parameter will really

663
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:17,318
influence so for example like this one

664
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:22,159
is uh you know the

665
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:23,199
microbial uh 10 over time of micro micro

666
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,399
is a

667
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,399
five and this uh

668
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:40,240
yeah this uh that's make it the

669
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:43,480
um so let me see if uh you know the this

670
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,679
enzyme turn over time if enzyme turn

671
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,318
over time fast and then these become

672
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:54,559
negative so those are modal exercise and

673
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:57,199
then actually in once we do data

674
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,480
simulation we can constraint each of the

675
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,719
prodct

676
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,039
so apparently because now we get the

677
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:09,118
most relationship probably look like

678
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:12,440
this so look like probably um uh this

679
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,519
enzyme 10 over time I I I really we need

680
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,679
to check the real data but uh based on

681
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,280
the relationship we got after data

682
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:26,118
simulation probably somewhere around

683
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:30,640
here so so the um my my C turn over time

684
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:33,800
around one on the 1.5

685
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,920
probably okay thanks if you need need

686
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,880
the real I mean the exactly value we can

687
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,519
we can dig into our our results great

688
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,519
thanks we have a question also in the

689
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,719
chat from Alison so she has uh two

690
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:52,280
questions the first is what do you mean

691
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:57,000
by AI can be a force for democratizing

692
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,440
data well the um not uh not the data

693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,719
probably

694
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,240
so what I what I meant is uh you know my

695
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:07,559
my La has been doing the data simulation

696
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:11,318
for about 20 some years and actually now

697
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,920
we find that that being it's much easier

698
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:17,838
and can do data simulation in a much

699
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:22,358
better way so so so actually this is

700
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:25,960
probably you know much easier to use and

701
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:28,039
uh you know before each if uh when I

702
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,639
take a new student of post store they

703
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:34,119
always take a long time to learn about

704
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,000
data simulation I now being probably

705
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,119
make the process much

706
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,280
easier great and the second question she

707
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,000
has is uh you ended with a really strong

708
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,680
point that AI is only powerful if

709
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,519
researchers are answering important

710
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:49,039
questions so how can you gain input on

711
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,679
what the most important questions

712
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,358
stakeholders need answers to and what

713
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,960
questions do your team thinks are the

714
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,480
most important to address with the eye

715
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,519
going forward

716
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,039
well this is a this is a very great

717
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:09,000
question on questions well the you know

718
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:12,599
the I guess talking with the farmers and

719
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,800
also uh ping scientific I mean each of

720
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,599
the scientists you know generate their

721
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,800
own questions in the different way and

722
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,760
uh certainly the you know like the kind

723
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,240
of a

724
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,960
seminar and the lab meeting and talk

725
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:32,118
with farmers and depends on yeah your

726
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,358
your own work I guess different you know

727
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,880
different people have a different way to

728
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,719
to generate

729
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,920
questions I I understand that probably I

730
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:45,480
didn't answer your question very

731
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,639
well do we have any other questions in

732
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,639
the

733
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,838
audience yeah I have one over here why

734
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,639
don't you go ahead and I played with the

735
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:57,119
microphone so let's see if Yi can hear

736
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,480
you um uh thank you for the presentation

737
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,039
uh it seems some of it went over my head

738
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,159
but it really seems like they made you

739
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:08,440
earn your tenure here really interesting

740
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:13,000
um so hold on youi can you hear him

741
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,280
yes um yeah uh if if I understand

742
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,400
correctly uh a lot of your research is

743
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,200
based in in force um but when changing

744
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,920
and applying it to agriculture um we we

745
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,679
have like uh like management practices

746
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
that can influence these dynamics that

747
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:33,799
you're describing in is do you see a

748
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,838
possibility uh of of using kind of your

749
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,920
work and and moving it towards like a

750
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:41,799
agricultural uh Focus focused questions

751
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,960
despite the complexity of like different

752
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,119
management um decisions on a spatial

753
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,000
scale like the

754
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,240
glob yes that's a great question and uh

755
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,719
certainly uh you know after I join

756
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:01,679
joined the so so on the crop science

757
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:06,239
session this is a very important uh

758
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:08,440
issues I uh we are exploring and

759
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,558
certainly we don't want to just you know

760
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,000
the walk on Forest or grassland or

761
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:18,960
Global scales but also try to make some

762
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,519
contributions to S on crop sections

763
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,199
science sections and uh so what our

764
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:29,079
thinking is probably in the towards the

765
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:33,480
end is just uh let me see can you see my

766
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:37,039
slides let me see yes for the end we um

767
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,559
we are you know I'm I only mentioned

768
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:43,800
very briefly we are currently do soall

769
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:48,040
transfer learning and

770
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:51,119
uh uh probably if uh uh you know you may

771
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:55,719
know that currently none of the soil

772
00:43:51,119 --> 00:44:00,559
model can predict well if uh even uh you

773
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:03,759
know even we have like being or product

774
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:07,920
we still cannot apply to the individual

775
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:11,319
Farmers because this uh you know

776
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,559
individual F may not have enough data so

777
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:16,440
what I'm we are thinking about is so

778
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,960
called transfer learning so the idea is

779
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,240
very similar to like chter GTP Char GTP

780
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,240
train lot of you know to train with a

781
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:29,078
lot of data big data but when they

782
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,558
answer when answer your particular

783
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:36,079
questions and CH dtp borrow the

784
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,680
information from other data sets try to

785
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,559
answer your questions so this is

786
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,558
actually is called transfer learning so

787
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:48,599
the idea if we apply to here is if we

788
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:52,960
can train the the model I mean the let's

789
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:57,200
be or product with a lot of data at the

790
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,000
global scales then we supposed to kind

791
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:04,118
apply that knowledge to a particular

792
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,920
firm so this is the idea we are

793
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:11,559
exploring try to try to apply to the

794
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:16,200
individual Farms so this idea probably

795
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:20,240
also applicable to any uh you know any

796
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:25,318
of these subject areas for example crop

797
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:28,919
year or the we weat control and um you

798
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:32,358
know some other issues yeah nitrogen

799
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,400
fixation yeah so this is the kind of

800
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:35,598
things we are thinking about I

801
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,318
understand we

802
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,640
still uh haven't made uh a great

803
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:45,239
contribution to so on the crop session

804
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:47,199
for for individual Farm I mean the for

805
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,959
Farm

806
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,719
yet does it make sense yeah thanks you

807
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,559
we're we're at time so if we could thank

808
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,919
Ichi

809
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:01,519
again well thank you all for listening

810
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,519
and for great

811
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,239
questions this has been a production of

812
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:13,239
Cornell University on the web at
