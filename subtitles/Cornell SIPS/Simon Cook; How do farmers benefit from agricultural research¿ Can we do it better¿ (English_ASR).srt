1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,480
University so I spent time in Australia

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:15,160
and then in about 2000 went overseas

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,800
joined the international Set uh and then

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,399
went back to back to Australia in 2016

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,719
now I'm back in Colombia so I've been

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,358
around a lot so the title here and I'm a

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,198
specialist in Precision Agriculture and

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,599
and what you might call on Farm

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,960
experimentation and digital agriculture

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,238
but I've been around a lot and I've seen

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,200
a lot of demand for actually getting

13
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,799
change from research in agriculture so

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,920
this talk is going to be a real mish

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,479
mash there'll be some things that you're

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,800
very familiar with there'll be some

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,038
things that you probably don't like

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,399
there are going to be some things that

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,679
may be new to you but hopefully what I

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,480
want to do is just try and Forge Forge a

21
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:58,000
picture uh of change and how we can as

22
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,358
researchers we can get change and why

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,119
it's so important in agriculture culture

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,719
so here we are title delivering

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,719
agricultural research to Farmers

26
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:15,239
well is that gonna

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,719
go oh there we go very fancy I didn't do

28
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,599
that I didn't do that that was Microsoft

29
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:24,400
so uh delivering agricultural search to

30
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,000
Farmers should actually be delivering

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
agricultural research not just to but

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,719
also with farmers in actual fact seeing

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Farmers not just as recipients of

34
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,000
research and of science but actual co-

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,640
innovators it's not easy but I think

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,879
it's worth trying and it's not the only

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,840
thing for science to do but I think it's

38
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,039
something that we've kind of kind of

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,478
ignored and need to develop a little bit

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,680
more so they outline a little bit small

41
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,959
there sorry about that but what I'll do

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,280
I'll first of all I'll just paint a

43
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:58,559
picture of the demand for uh science and

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,399
research I then talk not just about

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,960
production because we tend to Focus

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,280
quite a lot on production but I want to

47
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,038
switch just emphasis a little bit to

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,080
Food Systems because that's where we are

49
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,439
uh these days and then I just want to

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,640
spend a few minutes talking about how do

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,479
you know or what do you think science

52
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,318
really does how do you actually get

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,959
change in the system and how do you know

54
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,199
that it's actually occurred so I'll talk

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,800
a little bit about the theory of change

56
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,039
I'll then spend a little bit of time

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,840
talking about the value who actually

58
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,359
gets the value from research because we

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,598
hardly ever think about that and

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,120
actually it's a very under researched uh

61
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,159
uh topic and I'll just finish off with a

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,560
bit of stuff that I really like doing

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,400
theond Farm experimentation as an

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,598
example of putting farmers in the center

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,158
of change okay so that's the outline if

66
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,359
you want you can go to sleep for part of

67
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,158
it and then wake up for a bit of it or

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,599
maybe stay awake for the first part and

69
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:59,840
then doze off

70
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:01,318
later you okay it's okay that's fine so

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,799
let's think a bit about the growing

72
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,158
demands for a research I'm not from a

73
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,480
farm I will be get my own Farm but I'm

74
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:12,120
not from a farm or farming background

75
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,878
but even I can see that it's really

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,039
important globally uh agricultural

77
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,239
research to support change here we have

78
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,759
the obvious one to start with is

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
population growth population growth in

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,039
North

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:31,679
America up still growing through 2050

82
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,679
reaching a plateau about 2100

83
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,318
think about Europe Europe is already

84
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,438
passing its peak growth phase put these

85
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,878
two together you still got fairly

86
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:45,959
moderate growth of course if you think

87
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,639
about Latin America that's still in its

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,959
standard growth phase should flatten out

89
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,000
in the next few decades compare that

90
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,959
tiny compared to the growth of

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
population throughout Asia particularly

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,840
in India but not just India and still

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,120
still growing and not due to Peak for

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,360
another couple of decades now that's

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,280
worrying enough heading us towards uh n

96
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,480
plus billion people but here's the

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,878
really scary one for me is that the

98
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,719
growth of population in Africa projected

99
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,560
to increase through its

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,000
2100 and increase further still in fact

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,680
we'll only reach the global peak in

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,959
about 2018 so there's still a lot more

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,280
people uh heading our way uh and the

104
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,079
impacts are going to be

105
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,638
massive what are the impacts on food

106
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,758
demand well here's a graphic from the

107
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,680
FAO you'll all have read those reports

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,199
you know effectively a doubling of of

109
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,000
demand for food production and protein

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,560
throughout the world what's it going to

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,720
mean in terms of the demand for

112
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,038
land this is the business as usual

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,720
another 100 million hectares pretty

114
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,680
serious if we get it right if we get

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
agriculture really right then there's

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,918
some hope that will reduce the demand

117
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,840
for further extensification of

118
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,359
agricultural land by intensification and

119
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,279
other smart agriculture to actually end

120
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,520
up just a little bit more but that's not

121
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,478
happening just yet if we have this third

122
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,839
scenario which is called the stratified

123
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,038
they call it the stratified Society

124
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,679
scenario but it basically means that no

125
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,038
effort is put into correcting

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,959
inequalities throughout the world the

127
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,159
FAO project an actual fact that if we

128
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,519
don't fix that this is going to be the

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,639
demand for agricultural land arable land

130
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,799
anyway uh through to 20150 massive

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,759
increase much more than we can sustain

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,600
this shaded area here is the projections

133
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,360
of how much land will be

134
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,400
lost uh through degradation through not

135
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
taking care so huge demand for

136
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,959
improvement and efficiences of

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,079
agricultural systems and in terms of

138
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,918
investment in agricultural landscape

139
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,159
really major where's the food going to

140
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,680
come from well I just threw these in

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,319
just out of amusement basically these

142
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,319
are the uh figures from FAO for food

143
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,439
export for wheat millions of tons this

144
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
is North America okay you've had your

145
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,199
good years and your bad years but

146
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,639
generally it's slight upward Trend but

147
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,720
more or less stable this is Eastern

148
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,759
Europe so in other words you got new

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,880
entries into the global Food Market this

150
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,560
is for

151
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,199
wheat similar story for corn or maze

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,759
where you've got two new entries

153
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,720
actually overtaking this is Eastern

154
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,439
Europe again okay this is I guess the

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,120
Ukraine effect there but in actual fact

156
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:53,199
Latin America Argentina and Brazil are

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,319
going great guns to export more uh corn

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,120
throughout the world similar story for

159
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,240
soy here we have growth of soy exports

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,639
from North America increasing but those

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,400
from particularly from Brazil increasing

162
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,160
even more rapidly so it's going to be

163
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,878
change in production systems globally to

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,479
meet massive growth in

165
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,520
demand production isn't the only thing

166
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,800
that we need to worry about here we have

167
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,198
a grath of greenhouse gas emissions from

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,439
meat-based

169
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,478
systems two worrying Trends here huge

170
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,560
growth of greenhouse gases emission from

171
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,478
meat-based systems in Africa and Brazil

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,399
some places have actually got slightly

173
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,800
better China is one uh big problem there

174
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,839
greenhouse gas

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,158
management similar true for crops you

176
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,679
can have these graphs if you like rice

177
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,759
is obviously the one that people are

178
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,079
worried about but large growth in

179
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,158
greenhouse gas emissions CO2

180
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,399
equivalent uh throughout the world a

181
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,680
major concern

182
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:06,359
another concern food waste something

183
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,120
like 20 30% of food is actually wasted

184
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,400
throughout the food

185
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,240
system this figure here your country and

186
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,000
mine Australia and North

187
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,478
America

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,598
1,520 calories lost or wasted per person

189
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:29,478
per day huge losses within the

190
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:32,200
system major concern for the World Bank

191
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,918
so getting on top of that and another

192
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,959
problem facing agricultural research is

193
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,240
the protection of natural Capital

194
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,399
interesting to see McKenzie produced

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,360
this report last

196
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,399
year about getting companies on board to

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,480
try and correct the erosion of natural

198
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,799
Capital globally so my point is it's not

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,320
just production anymore there are a

200
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:59,958
number of different issues major issues

201
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,839
facing uh agriculture facing

202
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,159
agricultural research so you all know

203
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,040
all this but there's a switch to

204
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,639
thinking towards Food Systems food

205
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,879
system thinking offers a much wider

206
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,600
scope for opportunities for research and

207
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,519
change and now I'm about to show you

208
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
this diagram horrendously complex but

209
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:25,078
it's the best one I could find uh and it

210
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
portrays very well the complexity of the

211
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:30,159
food

212
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,439
system just to make this a little bit

213
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,199
easier to think about you can think

214
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,560
about five

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,440
domains this is where the business

216
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,759
really starts the production domain now

217
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,720
this has occupied a lot of our thinking

218
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,159
for many years how to produce more food

219
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,680
how to produce more stuff but in actual

220
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,919
fact when you take a food system

221
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,359
thinking there are other domains that

222
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,639
are equally important in actual fact I

223
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,399
got tuned into this when I looked into

224
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,519
digital agriculture try and to

225
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,958
understand what was happen Happ in

226
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
digital agriculture the investments in

227
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,319
digital agriculture there are more

228
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,120
investments in digital agriculture in

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,680
this end of the system than there are in

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,600
this end of the system so to them these

231
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,359
are the bit that's growing the consumer

232
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,000
side of things so it's not just about

233
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,360
producing more stuff and doing it better

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,039
but it's also learning what consumers

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,320
want and need and tuning the system

236
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,078
towards their needs a little bit more

237
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
there's a lot of attention also going

238
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:34,039
into processes improving these complex

239
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,278
food supply chains that actually get you

240
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,519
from a ton of maze through to the final

241
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,078
product that people pay a lot

242
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,519
for two more domains to think about one

243
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,599
is the capitals so thinking about how

244
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,200
can you protect a nurture human and

245
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,399
environmental capital on which the whole

246
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,240
system depends we tend to ignore that

247
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,958
but that's really important and

248
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,039
increasingly important throughout the

249
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,958
world and the fifth one is how you going

250
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,639
to govern the whole system how you going

251
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,958
to manage Finance how you going to

252
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,639
manage regulation to actually keep the

253
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,638
system working effectively and keeping

254
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,320
these demands in Balance so there's a

255
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,278
lot of thought gone into food system

256
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,320
thinking and I think it's opens many

257
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:23,639
different avenues for agricultural

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,720
research now here's the thing in reality

259
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:30,278
how does research actually deliver

260
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,278
change well there's one concept here

261
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:36,000
that I actually quite like a lot of

262
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,360
people in the CG don't like this they

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
think well we've done a lot of good work

264
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,519
developing new germ plasm we don't need

265
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
to worry too much about how our change

266
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,320
is actually occurring I think there's a

267
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,679
big difference if you're actually

268
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
producing new germ plasm you're

269
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,799
producing a wonderful seed you can throw

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,759
that seed into a system and there's a

271
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,799
reasonable chance if it's the right

272
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,278
thing that people will work out how to

273
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,039
use use it if you're actually looking

274
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,639
about how the system itself is being

275
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,278
managed that's a lot more complex issue

276
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,000
and you have to think or they have to

277
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,639
think people have to think a lot harder

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,519
about how the change is actually

279
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,120
occurring and we tend not to do that

280
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,159
we're so fixated on doing the work

281
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,440
writing up the papers publishing the

282
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,240
papers going on to the next paper that

283
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,800
there's no reward in most research

284
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,680
systems for actually thinking about the

285
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,159
actual change on the ground and this was

286
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,719
something that I really liked when I

287
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,639
first went to Australia the CEO of the

288
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,680
national research organization came out

289
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,519
and he said look you know I'm not really

290
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,359
interested how many papers you've

291
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,959
published this year he said he said

292
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,839
you've got to publish the papers because

293
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,278
that's how you learn your science but I

294
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,320
don't really care how many you've done

295
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,159
what I need you to do is I need you to

296
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,600
tell me what science have you developed

297
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,919
to enable change that I can report to

298
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,600
politicians and get the politicians off

299
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,278
my back so for me that was a revelation

300
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,000
because coming from the UK which was a

301
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,759
highly academic system and there was a

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,759
huge disconnect between research and and

303
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,759
real outcomes to go to a system where

304
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,319
research was being rewarded for its

305
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,679
science providing it delivered some kind

306
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,800
of change that was quite important so

307
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,159
again I think the theory of change is

308
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,039
quite a helpful

309
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,679
concept if you think about your search

310
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,799
Could you actually do uh do this the

311
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,759
theory of change could you actually

312
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:37,240
specify what is the the explicit or

313
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,319
testable model of how and why change

314
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,639
that you're supporting is actually going

315
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,199
to happen can you do that honestly it's

316
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,680
not easy uh and it can sometimes be

317
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,120
quite challenging and of course your

318
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,679
change may not be directly with Farmers

319
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,919
you might be helping somebody else who's

320
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,278
going to be helping Farmers you're an

321
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,559
important part of the chain but still

322
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,759
you're in part of what's called an

323
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,359
impact pathway which is an important

324
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,199
concept

325
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,159
the theory of change also needs to

326
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,000
identify the context and the key actors

327
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,759
in the system so who actually are you

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,320
talking to who are you hoping to change

329
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,720
what are their behaviors that you're

330
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,240
expecting to change and have you really

331
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,240
thought about it or whether you're

332
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,839
delivering what they're what's going to

333
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,039
enable them to change and then think

334
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,000
about the causal Pathways a little

335
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,360
bit that can contribute to those

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,759
outcomes and impacts now not everybody

337
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,320
in this room needs to worry about all of

338
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:37,120
these but you're part of a change

339
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:41,680
process and it's good just to recognize

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,839
uh what part you play so here you have a

341
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,838
theory of change diagram you know you

342
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,199
thought my diagrams were terrible this

343
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,279
is even worse but it puts all of the

344
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:53,039
things together this is what we tend to

345
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,240
focus on as researchers activities and

346
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,639
if you're lucky we'll think a bit about

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,320
the outputs you know what we're

348
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,000
producing where are our results where

349
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,560
are our papers or reports but the

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,198
process actually goes through towards an

351
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,319
outcome which is basically a behavioral

352
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,039
change somebody's going to do something

353
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,920
differently that they couldn't have done

354
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,838
if you hadn't delivered that

355
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:18,159
output what is that and how is it

356
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,720
actually going to happen now here they

357
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,439
talk about these things spheres of

358
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,199
control spheres of influence and spheres

359
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,040
of interest you can only control this

360
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:29,120
part of the change process but you're

361
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,719
assuming and you're understanding and

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
because you talk to people who you hope

363
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,120
are going to use your research you're

364
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,519
going to help deliver these in the

365
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,440
sphere of influence and over the longer

366
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:42,240
term produce these bigger term impacts

367
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,240
that you think are really really

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
important actually just going through

369
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
this process is very important very

370
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,000
helpful too because it actually helps

371
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,318
you sharpen your activities and outputs

372
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,278
to actually achieve these

373
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,719
goals okay I don't want to spend too

374
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,198
much longer on that because it's kind of

375
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,600
bureaucratic

376
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,639
um but I think it's helpful and if I was

377
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,480
a young researcher I would really like

378
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,879
to have learned a little bit about that

379
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,560
so even if I focused on my bit I could

380
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,240
see where it led towards the bigger

381
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,919
picture

382
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,639
okay now here's this bit of weird stuff

383
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:20,519
here is it the value of the change

384
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,480
drives research but who actually gets

385
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,519
the value often we make assumptions

386
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,039
about

387
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,679
this and I got into this because when I

388
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,919
looked at digital

389
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,239
agriculture it pretty clear that there

390
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,120
was a lot of work and a lot of

391
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,680
activities going on in digital

392
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,639
agriculture but Farmers didn't get it

393
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,359
they didn't like it there was a article

394
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,198
in the Wall Street Journal Harold you

395
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,159
might seen this one it was a couple of

396
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,318
years back about the disappointment of

397
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,759
big data in agriculture and about

398
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,519
disappointment of digital agriculture

399
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,399
basically everybody's still trying to

400
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,839
figure out where the value in data is

401
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,240
this is a this was a speaking and it a a

402
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,480
feature in the Wall Street Journal and

403
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,599
the reason this came up is because

404
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,160
agriculture here we had a a a graphic of

405
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,918
the different sectors of the US economy

406
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,839
and don't worry the Australians were

407
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,319
just as bad this was the level of

408
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,438
digitization within the sector

409
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,879
agriculture bottom of the class

410
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,038
basically so the question is why is that

411
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,360
actually occurring and it seems to be

412
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,359
the problem is that the value isn't

413
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:36,079
being delivered to

414
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:38,159
Farmers now how to explain that now this

415
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,000
isn't the prettiest of diagrams but I

416
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,360
hope it gets somewhere the best I found

417
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,079
to try and help explain this was uh from

418
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,759
a uh series of work in the UK by an

419
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:55,079
economist called pavit and he

420
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:58,919
identified uh how technology was

421
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:01,639
used in Industries in the UK and he came

422
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,280
up with this four class

423
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,759
model that explained where the value was

424
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:12,399
created and more importantly where it

425
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:14,720
was kept he had these four classes and

426
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,720
here these flashes are supposed to be

427
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,600
Valu don't worry I'll explain these

428
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,600
hopefully in a second let's take this

429
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,558
one because this one is the one that

430
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:27,079
we're probably most familiar with this

431
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,879
is I think he called it the public uh

432
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:34,158
R&amp;D model

433
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:39,520
whereby governments invest in the

434
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:42,159
research they do that because they're

435
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,639
expecting that you will

436
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:48,919
produce brilliant research outputs that

437
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,679
have some public good they don't mind

438
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,320
you actually working for senta or or

439
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,280
somebody else providing you do it at

440
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,119
Al's length because they're saying we

441
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:02,798
want to use taxpayers money uh to try

442
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:06,079
and develop things that has a general uh

443
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:09,639
general public good now what you might

444
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,279
find a mixture of innovation hubs to try

445
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,280
and help this process move

446
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,720
along and in

447
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,918
agriculture traditionally what we' tried

448
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,200
to do is rely an extension processes to

449
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,320
get from here down to here these farmer

450
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,319
groups okay so the value is created here

451
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,079
and it's actually shared

452
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,759
uh and often promulgated by publication

453
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,359
processes to actually try and spread the

454
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,798
word that's

455
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,038
good now the next model relies on

456
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,918
private

457
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,000
R&amp;D John Deere

458
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,759
senta buer they have big research

459
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,319
budgets good

460
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,158
operators they're not going to publish

461
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,798
their or spread their intellectual

462
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,880
property any further than they have to

463
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,119
so they try to tend to keep it because

464
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,640
that's where where they're getting their

465
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,639
value from they have a product that they

466
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,520
want to sell to Farmers or others they

467
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
want to sell the next product they want

468
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,879
to get more value out of the next

469
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,919
product out of their R&amp;D by providing

470
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,679
something that is considered to be worth

471
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,880
a little bit more so they keep the IP

472
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,720
they keep the value in house different

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
to the one before they actually try and

474
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,480
keep that in house and quite often

475
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,119
they'll protect that quite fiercely and

476
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,200
if you see where the investment is going

477
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,119
in digital act you a lot of it is

478
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
actually going into this kind of thing

479
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,000
whereby a service or a product is

480
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,240
actually being delivered to Farmers

481
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,919
farmers buy

482
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,798
it lot of the value stays with the

483
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,880
producer the third type is what you

484
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,119
might call scale sensitive it's what

485
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,200
it's not a great word but what it means

486
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,599
is that the value is generated at

487
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,960
different parts of a supply chain or a

488
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,038
value chain economists can't work out

489
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,279
whether they prefer that now you can

490
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,919
think about this there are large

491
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,480
integrated organizations within the food

492
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,520
system remember the food system diagram

493
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,519
there are some large organizations

494
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,519
within that that they don't

495
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:19,240
want um disruptive innovation they want

496
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:22,639
cumulative Innovation they see their

497
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,599
position in within the system as being

498
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,559
quite powerful and dominant and they

499
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,480
want to try and hold that within their

500
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,798
within their organizations as much as

501
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,000
they can so they will protect that uh IP

502
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,359
as well they'll have closed doors they

503
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,519
they they won't willingly share all of

504
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,158
that they'll they'll expect that to be

505
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:45,038
within their own system so you can think

506
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,520
of the the large agricultural Agri

507
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,079
business organizations that actually use

508
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,240
technology learn and keep it that way

509
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:56,079
but farmers in these cases at best are

510
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,120
seen as suppliers of product and might

511
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,558
get rewarded for it or they might not

512
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:04,359
but they're not getting value so that

513
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:07,359
leaves us with the last type of

514
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:10,319
model which is what's called supplier

515
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:13,719
dominated not a great word but basically

516
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:17,678
this is the one I would say is

517
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,000
missing somewhat and so what I'd like to

518
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,880
think of and like I'd try and see is

519
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,919
actually improving the value generation

520
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,240
within this class of business model in

521
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,240
which Farmers learn by doing they much

522
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,000
more but also increase the value that

523
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,159
they can generate through networking and

524
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,359
through technology adoption so obviously

525
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,640
that is going to rely also on these so

526
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,558
the interaction between these and

527
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,640
particularly from you guys how do you

528
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,200
actually get the processes through to

529
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,720
that so they can start generating their

530
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,519
value for themselves uh near to

531
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,640
hand that's where we come on to unarm

532
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:03,558
experimentation and I'll just spend just

533
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,440
a few minutes on this in which we see as

534
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:09,720
probably you do farmers as co-

535
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,480
innovators not receivers of innovation

536
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,640
but actually co- innovators okay now

537
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,919
when you say the word experimentation it

538
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,840
raises all kinds of things in research

539
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,840
institutes such as this one so you can

540
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,839
think about what is an

541
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,079
experiment and often we use experiments

542
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:34,158
to explore law theories but I would say

543
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:37,480
there is different types of experiments

544
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,480
and different types of experimental

545
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,440
thinking one is around epistemic Theory

546
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,319
driven which tends to be have a semantic

547
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,000
Focus that means that you're interested

548
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,278
in the meaning that the results

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,400
represent to you and to do that you need

550
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,159
to have the theory and these are

551
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,559
scientist implemented because that's

552
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,799
what we do you know that's what we learn

553
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,639
as scientists but there's another type

554
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,519
of experiment which is action guiding

555
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,360
Theory it's much more pragmatic you know

556
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,558
if you talk to a farmer about the

557
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,319
results of an experiment that they put

558
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,879
in they're less interested in actually

559
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,439
why it occurred they do want to know why

560
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
it occurred but they're less interested

561
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,600
in why it occurred that the fact that it

562
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,599
did occur and that it means something to

563
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,278
them in that system you could say that

564
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,158
they're sort of characterized pain I

565
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,839
don't really care why it did it I just

566
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,880
know it does it every year and I want to

567
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,599
fix it you know so that's much a

568
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,559
stronger uh action it's much more

569
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,879
pragmatic action and it's user

570
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:40,480
implemented now what I'd say is that in

571
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,200
agriculture we actually might have taken

572
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,000
a wrong turning because experimentation

573
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,519
was the core of agricultural development

574
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,960
for a long time but in the 1920s you

575
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,359
know sir Ronald he came out with his

576
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,840
fantastic analysis of variance you know

577
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,879
mathematically uh

578
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,558
mathematically um elegant thinking and

579
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,399
the learning at that time definitely

580
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,639
switched switched strongly to

581
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:13,199
Specialists then we moved

582
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,480
into uh sort of a a style of working

583
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,519
with a lot of gen germplasm research and

584
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,278
then Precision egg came along but it was

585
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:26,079
driven from here or the weat the corn

586
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:28,720
Bel anyway and learning and IP tended to

587
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,278
be distanced somewhat from Farmers

588
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,600
Farmers again were pushed into the

589
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,960
position of being buyers of intellectual

590
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,278
products and services that were

591
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,079
developed by others so what we're trying

592
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,798
to do with the of here pharmac Centric

593
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,798
ofc of is actually trying to shift the

594
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,240
emphasis back to Farmers so this is what

595
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,639
it looks like you got a diff two

596
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,679
different types of change processes here

597
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,679
we got the exogenous one that we've

598
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,679
tended to use for a long time you're

599
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,759
aiming for certain generalizable results

600
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,159
you don't really know too much about the

601
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,960
relevance because tend we tend not to

602
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,159
ask we don't know about the adoption

603
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
rate and are often disappointed that

604
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,919
there should be more but it hasn't

605
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,079
happened and it generally has a low data

606
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,600
content because the experiment is where

607
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,759
the data was generated when you put it

608
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,480
out you don't tend to follow

609
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:27,119
up endogenous approach we want to see

610
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,679
pharmac Centric Farmers come up with the

611
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,439
questions

612
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,360
the results are often highly variable in

613
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,080
our experience they're often highly

614
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:39,199
variable and quite uncertain but they're

615
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,278
extremely relevant on site and they're

616
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,880
easily adopted because they're framed by

617
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,440
the farmer and they're interpreted with

618
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,559
the farmer in ways that they can use and

619
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,679
they tend to create a lot of

620
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,359
data now here's one that we started with

621
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,240
this picture it's a terrible picture I'd

622
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,879
actually lost track of it completely but

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,558
this was the first of our large uh on

624
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,000
Farm experimentations it was in the

625
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:07,319
bloody 90s right it was 30 years ago

626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,640
almost and it was done almost by

627
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:13,480
accident we had a a farmer a farmer's

628
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,000
boy who was brilliant at the technology

629
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,679
and he actually developed the first

630
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,519
veril technology in Australia to produce

631
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,679
this

632
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,599
checkerboard uh uh test and we thought

633
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,399
this was just fantastic the farmer loved

634
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,038
it agronomists hated it

635
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,719
uh because when we analyze the results

636
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:37,558
of this experiment and it was a 7 our

637
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,319
first experiment 72 hectares right we

638
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,960
found that there were many different

639
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,839
sources of variation we had set this out

640
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,798
as a nitrogen trial but in actual fact

641
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,038
there were weeds there there was wetness

642
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,519
there was drought on the all in the same

643
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,679
area there was uh potassium deficiency

644
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,960
over one part and another part the trace

645
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,600
element deficiency we said to the farmer

646
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,120
you know sorry Doug this is this is

647
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,519
impossible you know how can we how can

648
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,479
we make sense of this there's just too

649
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,240
many things going on in actual fact

650
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,079
nitrogen even though we' plasted it with

651
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,558
soil samples and had a really good

652
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,558
agronomist working with us we still were

653
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,759
unable to explain much more than about

654
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,079
30% of the area the response over 30% of

655
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,319
the area and the farm said well welcome

656
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,000
to my world you know this is what I have

657
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,240
to deal with every padic every year it's

658
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,919
uncertain and this information even

659
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,000
though it covers only part of the area

660
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,038
it's still useful to me I find it useful

661
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,240
and I believe it because it's on my land

662
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,200
anyway we thought this was great but

663
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,359
actually fact it wasn't the first of uh

664
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,440
pharmac Centric attempts but these a lot

665
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,398
of work would been going on in the 80s

666
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,240
and 90s uh Larry Harrington he was here

667
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,079
do do you remember Larry he was he did a

668
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,200
lot of this earlier work with simmit and

669
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,720
seat Jackie Ashby they did a lot of

670
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,600
participatory research but they didn't

671
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,319
have the data that we have now and they

672
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,519
didn't have the processes and they

673
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,798
weren't able to capture the value put

674
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,240
back into the system so that's what

675
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,398
we're aiming for so anyway we uh we got

676
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:12,839
on to this and we did all sorts of weird

677
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:15,759
stuff o sorry uh it's gone we had uh

678
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,839
strips replicated strips blocks donut

679
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,759
Checkers all sorts of experimental

680
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:23,038
design the Farms liked all of them uh in

681
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,240
many cases the agronomist found it very

682
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,000
difficult to work with because the

683
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,880
results were too big too uncertain so

684
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,919
what's the basic process well the first

685
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,440
one is you need

686
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,799
organization you need to organize F you

687
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,200
can't can't do with one to one you got

688
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:41,480
to look for organizing

689
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,960
entities uh in our area it was farmer

690
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,319
groups or it could have been a supplier

691
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,798
these sort of things the organization is

692
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,359
key farmers do the inquiry they start

693
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,879
looking to see what happens if I do this

694
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:58,000
The Specialist support let me help you

695
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,600
with this stuff and and then the farmers

696
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,720
and Specialists together interpret the

697
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:06,639
results and then they continue inquiry

698
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,038
very simple process as I said we had

699
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,519
lots of different types of uh designs

700
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,839
this was actually one of our earliest

701
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,000
ones we were very proud of that but

702
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,439
nobody else liked it um checkerboard and

703
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,558
strips Farms do these in Australia they

704
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,440
in in I know here they do they do a lot

705
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,720
of these standard this was actually the

706
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,000
largest one we we did was 6,000 hectares

707
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,880
but that was an oil palm they just

708
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,359
wanted know what was going on the enre

709
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,000
Strip or the strip trials those are very

710
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:38,038
commonly used experiments quite large

711
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,960
and the important thing about that is

712
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:44,759
that we see it as a continuous what we

713
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,960
call a racetrack process of Engagement

714
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:50,079
data capture analysis interpretation and

715
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,200
then use so there's a mixture of

716
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:56,199
Technical and social processes going on

717
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,480
here we have some basic rules that we

718
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,798
applied we found them useful the first

719
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,360
was obviously keep it pharmac Centric

720
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,398
this was one that the farmer more or

721
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,558
less put in without help he just wanted

722
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,959
to do it

723
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:10,599
himself keep it simple keep the

724
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,200
experimental structure simple because

725
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,278
the landscape is big and it will get

726
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,720
complex so keep the experimental design

727
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,159
as simple as you possibly can keep it

728
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,038
big two reasons for that one is that you

729
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,840
want to use as far as possible

730
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,440
commercial Machinery uh you want the

731
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,759
farmer to be able to install the

732
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,600
experiment without thinking too much

733
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,480
about it it's got to be concordant with

734
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,079
their ways of managing it the other

735
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,720
reason is that farmers understand and

736
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,278
manage their land according to landscape

737
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,440
Clues and signals they understood for

738
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,839
example that this bit of dirt down here

739
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,759
produced these results for that reason

740
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,480
and that this was quite different up

741
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,720
there in other words they like it big uh

742
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,038
because it helps them interpret it and

743
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,399
apply it to management keep out of the

744
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,480
way there are times when Farmers don't

745
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,278
want to talk to you there are times when

746
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,159
they're too busy so it's there are

747
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:07,759
certain times when we had this rule keep

748
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:12,000
out of the way make it easy and keep

749
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,000
exploring okay so those were basic

750
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,000
ideas so how do you actually get value

751
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:21,480
from the process well here we have a

752
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,480
number of kind of quotes about what are

753
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,599
the sort of

754
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,639
things uh that they found and there are

755
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:30,759
a number of characteristics about the

756
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:33,599
way that farmers said they found these

757
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:33,599
results

758
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,278
helpful one of them is that it was

759
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,798
pretty clear what worked to them and

760
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:45,679
what didn't what was important

761
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:48,480
accumulative one is when it helps them

762
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,240
learn much more about their system and

763
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,720
they become more certain to the point at

764
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,159
which they can make those critical

765
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,399
management change and the other one is

766
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,480
that sharing can be important that

767
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,759
actually a collective use of insight can

768
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,240
be really important okay just a couple

769
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,480
of minutes to

770
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,120
go how do you actually scale up the

771
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,519
whole process well I don't know how many

772
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,599
how many of you might be familiar with

773
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,599
this but we use the business model

774
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:19,038
canvas uh idea to actually couple the

775
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,000
idea basically what the business model

776
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,720
canvas approach does and and we might

777
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,079
think we're proud if we get a few

778
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,558
hundred or even a thousand citations

779
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:31,398
this has actually got over 20 20 22,000

780
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,599
I think so is a very widely used in the

781
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:37,199
business world uh concept of basically

782
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:39,240
putting the whole package together

783
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,278
concentrate on these two bits first is

784
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,200
what's the basic idea how are you going

785
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,679
to offer a new service or what are you

786
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,480
going to produce that's going to help

787
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,880
people and who actually will you benefit

788
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,599
is it going to be Farmers is it going to

789
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,480
be certain types of farms is it going to

790
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,158
be Consultants may maybe suppliers if

791
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,240
you haven't worked out that then you

792
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,559
can't work out what this whole business

793
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,319
model is doing if you can work that out

794
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,638
then you can actually develop a business

795
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:09,159
model that can be scaled up and then so

796
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,319
the final part of this of story is

797
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,960
actually networking as Janice you'd

798
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,559
recognize some of these places probably

799
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,878
with horror but there we go so but they

800
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,918
this was just our first attempt at this

801
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,838
after doing that but there was an

802
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:26,679
instantly a a network of people who are

803
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:30,679
interested in trying to develop this and

804
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,358
that's really important from uh from a

805
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,200
scaling up point of view because you

806
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,239
can't be talking to individual Farmers

807
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,559
you need to actually scale out the

808
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,358
business model for impact so in summary

809
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,279
what have I been talking about first of

810
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,918
all hopefully made it pretty clear that

811
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,280
agriculture has to get more active and

812
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:53,799
there are still some really major uh

813
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,159
problems facing us and research it's

814
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,880
really a good time to be in agricultural

815
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,160
research as I think there's an awful lot

816
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,838
to do but I do think it's it's valuable

817
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,598
and important to think a bit not just

818
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,078
about production but think about the

819
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,079
food systems and think about the places

820
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,280
within the food system you might like

821
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
the research you're doing to actually

822
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,560
impact and change

823
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,079
things I would say farmers are often not

824
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,480
the only or

825
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,000
even most common uh developers of

826
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,519
research insight as currently done and

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,599
they are not often the recipients of

828
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,880
value according to those four business

829
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,880
models they there hasn't been that value

830
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,800
generated with Farmers for them they

831
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,800
tend to

832
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:48,240
be treated or assumed to be as customers

833
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,480
or clients of valuable IP generated from

834
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,439
elsewhere I think Cornell might be

835
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,159
somewhat different in that it still and

836
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,920
it always had an extension mindset of

837
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,159
government fund funded change but still

838
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,960
still good to focus on how the value is

839
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,118
going to be generated and how farmers

840
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,679
are going to get it and so what I'm

841
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,838
saying and what I'm working on

842
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,679
personally and with Louie is actually

843
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,679
pharmac Centric

844
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:17,960
co-innovation uh with

845
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:21,039
networking to develop this value based

846
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,400
IP with farmers and actually networking

847
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,880
up and I'd say here there's a huge new

848
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,920
role for researchers but it's not just

849
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,920
agronomy you've actually got to have

850
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,159
some social sciences in there and you'll

851
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,519
have the data Sciences to me and that's

852
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,559
very rare to find in any University

853
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:41,159
combination of agricultural Sciences

854
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,799
social sciences and data Sciences but

855
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,440
there's going to be a mix of those in

856
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,839
there to actually really get on top of

857
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:51,639
this because I think the real goal too

858
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,239
is that you want Farmers to go digital

859
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:56,679
and I think that's where the opportunity

860
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:59,639
is going to be so those words digital

861
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,919
dir word digital is a good word thank

862
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,639
you very much indeed thank

863
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:10,960
you the floor is open I will look here

864
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,960
question is there any pach left first

865
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:16,800
question

866
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,799
y I

867
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,400
wonder for

868
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,800
the Deale of the Innovation the

869
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,760
connection to markets Etc exactly yeah

870
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,240
good question yeah when you think of it

871
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:42,680
commodity Crop Production well can treat

872
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,879
Farmers as basically like surf producers

873
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:48,279
somewh because if you can't generate

874
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,318
value at the point of production then uh

875
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,680
the per unit value at the point of

876
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,440
production is relatively small and there

877
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:56,799
you see a lot of the value in

878
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,200
digitization anyway in the commodities

879
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,640
is actually taken by that second class

880
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,759
of the integrated uh the integrated

881
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,400
supply chain operator they they get the

882
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,400
value from that there they actually want

883
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,079
to drive down the price of commodity the

884
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,960
mo the most they can and they're happy

885
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,519
to receive product from wherever they

886
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,519
can if you think about high quality or

887
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,920
high value production there's much more

888
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,838
scope for Value generation around

889
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,599
Farmers I mean I live in Colombia the

890
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,639
the

891
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,318
only uh sustainable part of Colombian AG

892
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,759
culture is high quality coffee and it's

893
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:32,639
quite interesting it's actually a very

894
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,520
high skill level needed to produce

895
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,159
quality coffee and incidentally it was

896
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:41,318
the only area that was never governed by

897
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:43,159
Gera they always organized themselves

898
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:45,880
because they had very strong Social

899
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:47,480
Capital but it's an example of yes the

900
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,318
higher the value of the product and in

901
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,838
New York you have certain high value

902
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:52,318
products that are really important I

903
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:54,078
think and then you have a strong

904
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:56,318
connection with customer base down the

905
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,280
right hand side of the the food system

906
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,079
and you can produce more value by

907
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,000
learning what the customer wants and

908
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,599
actually learning how to produce it so

909
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
yeah good question but that's that's

910
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,440
right thank you very much

911
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,039
for um I You' mentioned farming systems

912
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,400
research to me like fsrd which started

913
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:20,639
in the 70s late 70s you know these

914
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,838
Concepts have been around for plus 40

915
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,679
years right ver beta what you presented

916
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:28,599
here yeah you suggested that one point

917
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,279
of failure might have been lack of data

918
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,440
to to work at that scale I'm I'm not

919
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,119
sure that's that's the entire

920
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,519
explanation I just wondering if you had

921
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,680
other thoughts no I also mentioned I

922
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,679
don't think they looked at the value

923
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,519
proposition idea and that's a kind of A

924
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,000
New Concept to try and work out well how

925
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,880
is what is the CH what is the

926
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,960
fundamental change that's going to

927
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,440
create the value and how you're actually

928
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,159
going to produce that to actually go

929
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,079
through that process you need to get

930
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,519
through to this business model concept

931
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,440
that is probably well it it postdates

932
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:03,199
the earlier farming system research so

933
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,240
from the farming system research stuff

934
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,519
that I saw I thought well this is great

935
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:10,199
but it was always dependent on external

936
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,719
money it was always the projects and

937
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,318
once the project money ran out then you

938
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,838
know it was CH Farmers we nice working

939
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:18,960
with you but we can't come back here

940
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,679
anymore I thought when I saw that we

941
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,800
have to get beyond that we have to try

942
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,838
and work out a way in which either

943
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,720
Farmers themselves or suppliers or

944
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:30,199
buyers are actually prepared to

945
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,279
subsidize or invest in that process that

946
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,439
involves the farmers and is around the

947
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,920
farmers and I don't think we really

948
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,480
understand I don't think we really

949
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,800
understood how to do that until we

950
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,000
thought about the business model

951
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,480
thinking so yeah well spotted and and I

952
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,039
agree you know we we thought we were

953
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,760
fantastic doing this Farm research and

954
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,079
then I came across all this stuff that

955
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,599
Larry had done 20 30 years earlier that

956
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,480
we would were talking about the 90s and

957
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,079
also in cat they did a lot of work on

958
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,079
that and they're still trying to do that

959
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,760
but they hadn't got over this these two

960
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:02,359
fundamental barriers one was the the

961
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,119
data because without data you can't it's

962
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,679
got to be cheap data because you have to

963
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,400
have a a an easy process a

964
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,318
cost-efficient process if you like for

965
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,838
the farmer to actually provide Insight

966
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:18,440
if you ask farmers to go out and even

967
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:20,039
you know measure on on yield Cuts what

968
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,838
they often they won't do it it's too

969
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,440
much it's too much work or they might

970
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,559
not just they just might not have time

971
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,119
to do it so you've got to have easy keep

972
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,318
data to do it so in our case we were

973
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,318
using Precision EG technology because

974
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:35,440
every Harvester comes with that

975
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,519
technology built into it these days

976
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,920
we're looking at remote sensing to

977
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,000
provide a backup for cheap data so you

978
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,720
can guarantee a process can run but you

979
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,079
also need the second part which is the

980
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,000
business model which actually identifies

981
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,800
the value and actually works out how

982
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,800
it's all going to work so thanks good

983
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,079
question um just a question kind of your

984
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:02,358
thoughts um in terms of thinking about

985
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,960
more developed countries and and less

986
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:05,480
developed countries or often kind of the

987
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,838
global North and Global South and the

988
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,159
data collection in these different um

989
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,039
areas let's say thinking like in the US

990
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,598
here we have a really great land grant

991
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,119
system and extension system where there

992
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,720
is a lot of on Farm research and and

993
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,240
hopefully unbiased science griven on

994
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,879
Farm research here you tend to go into

995
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,879
develop there's a lot more on Farm

996
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,640
research but may

997
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,880
from private companies right Magenta Bay

998
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,159
that and kind of the bias around the

999
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,079
data collection in these different areas

1000
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:40,920
I don't know any thoughts on that and

1001
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,519
how that may drive farmer decisions in

1002
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,159
those areas they okay there's there's a

1003
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:50,358
lot of work in Africa around um farma

1004
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,838
groups which because the one of the key

1005
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:54,318
things that you need is you need that

1006
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,639
organization to actually make the enable

1007
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,599
the process to run and so that's there

1008
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,598
is a lot of attention to farming groups

1009
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,880
and they're very interested in this

1010
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,440
process as a means of farmers generating

1011
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,000
their own Insight um there is you need

1012
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,358
the cheap you know the cheap data you

1013
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,280
need that cheap data and you can get

1014
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:14,759
data but it's but it's not that easy

1015
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,480
that's why we're looking at uh imagery

1016
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,680
remote sensing to actually provide that

1017
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,639
imagery the question about how do you

1018
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,239
trust how would you trust the results

1019
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:28,480
from uh would you trust the results from

1020
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:30,959
buer I think well they have the biggest

1021
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,599
uh incentive to actually work with

1022
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,720
farmers and those that I've spoke to

1023
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,720
they're quite Keen to do that farmers

1024
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,039
aren't stupid they they're happy to work

1025
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,399
with by but there you know there has to

1026
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,199
be a clear Arrangement it was quite

1027
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
interesting when we were working with a

1028
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,679
fertilizer company in

1029
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,639
Australia and the fertilizer company was

1030
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,318
rolling out their program of on Farm

1031
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,920
experimentation with their clients and I

1032
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,519
said to the guy who is running it for

1033
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,800
the fertilizer company I said but you

1034
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:02,519
realize um you realize that farmers

1035
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,240
might use these results to buy less

1036
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,920
fertilizer not more you know you realize

1037
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:08,679
that I need to tell you that right now

1038
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,318
because they might see that half of

1039
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,598
their land just isn't responding at all

1040
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:14,279
so they'll buy much less than they did

1041
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,680
before his response was really

1042
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,480
interesting he said he said I don't care

1043
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:22,239
I don't mind that he said our main game

1044
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,358
is to establish trust with the buyer

1045
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,799
because we don't want to lose our

1046
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:27,239
clients and then have to try and find

1047
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,519
them again he say as far as we're

1048
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,078
concerned we we're prepared to take a

1049
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,759
reduction in volume if we have them as a

1050
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,240
client throughout time so that sort of

1051
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,880
really caught my attention because what

1052
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,039
that meant was that the trust between

1053
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,240
the the the buyer and the seller or the

1054
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:46,039
the supplier and the farm user at the

1055
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:49,199
moment throughout Africa well Harold you

1056
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:52,318
you know this is that the at the moment

1057
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:55,159
fertilizer is shipped out shipped into

1058
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:58,519
country distributed and then from then

1059
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,719
on most suppliers have no idea what it

1060
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:03,239
does uh they don't even know where it

1061
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,118
went half the time if we could change

1062
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:08,159
that kind of model to one in which the

1063
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,440
supplier has a much more vested interest

1064
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,358
to actually enable Farmers to use it

1065
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,039
better through this farmer Centric

1066
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,279
process that that's what we're aiming

1067
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,599
for so yeah the balance thing trust

1068
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,280
thing is a big thing very good good

1069
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,480
question tricky one tricky one but a

1070
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,760
good one yes um is it

1071
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,760
often are other Ines usually provided uh

1072
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,240
to the farmers to participate in the

1073
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,960
research or is it usually enough the

1074
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,199
value that they might get all learning

1075
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,599
from the

1076
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,318
experience I think there are cases where

1077
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,519
that is done where Farmers have to be

1078
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:46,159
persuaded we didn't find that virtually

1079
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,960
every farmer I've spoken to is Keen to

1080
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,960
do it because they they like to do it

1081
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,400
anyway but remember that the fiber you

1082
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,519
have to be careful about the rules you

1083
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,559
can't come in and say you're going to do

1084
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,358
this you have to come in and ask the

1085
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,319
questions and what are you interested in

1086
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,358
changing and then when you're designing

1087
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:04,279
the experiment it has to be easy for

1088
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,119
them to install so you hear about a lot

1089
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,119
or you read a lot of Publications talk

1090
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,400
about some of the on Farm

1091
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,599
experimentations that we but they're too

1092
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,599
complex to survive outside the research

1093
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,240
ground so you you have to design it in

1094
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,800
that way but I've never found difficulty

1095
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:24,078
in in uh getting Farmers to to trial

1096
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,039
providing you do that good

1097
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:30,000
question the um

1098
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:34,558
so I I uh a couple days ago I taught a

1099
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,039
class for our freshman sustainable

1100
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:41,400
ulture for our first semester freshman

1101
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,119
and um about 10 minutes in it was about

1102
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,720
digital

1103
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,960
Ag and about 10 minutes in uh the

1104
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,759
students asked a number of very

1105
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,159
insightful questions like about that de

1106
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,400
just

1107
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:56,159
asked but it was also a question about

1108
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,400
well what about the public Pur private

1109
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,879
sector right so it's great to do all the

1110
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,039
on Farm research right but ultimately it

1111
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,680
needs to the the information that you

1112
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,000
gather and the knowledge that you

1113
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:11,239
develop needs to be delivered on a

1114
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,960
continuing basis right there need to be

1115
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,239
Services provide it needs to go into a

1116
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,000
piece of software or an or equipment or

1117
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:23,000
something like that right and what is

1118
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,159
your experience sort of in in taking all

1119
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,159
the knowledge that you gain from this

1120
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:30,759
and make it sort of permanent for the

1121
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:34,519
farmers and how do you deliver it should

1122
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,680
it be through the public sector private

1123
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:42,440
sector okay we have three models in our

1124
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:45,598
mind one is the uh is the semi-automatic

1125
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,400
model you can actually have these ofes

1126
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,039
semi-automatic and there's actually

1127
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,079
Services provided commercially by people

1128
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,920
in Australia and probably here too who

1129
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,160
will put out an experiment for you on

1130
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,599
your machinery they will analyze the

1131
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:01,598
results feed you back the results very

1132
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,559
cheap sort of standard

1133
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,680
thing there hardly been any taker in

1134
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,240
that because there's no interpretation

1135
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,000
of the result the second model is one

1136
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,318
where you have a facilitated

1137
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,760
interpretation of the results to create

1138
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:23,279
knowledge and the knowledge is the more

1139
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,920
permanent uh is the more perent entity

1140
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,160
in that process and that's that's the

1141
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,519
bit that we're trying to uh focus on

1142
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:33,838
knowledge is much more permanent and

1143
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,800
communicable than just individual

1144
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,358
results and individual results often

1145
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,119
Farmers aren't that Keen in those

1146
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:41,759
results actually being distributed

1147
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,039
widely anyway they'll they'll they're

1148
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,160
happy to share them within their group

1149
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,639
the third type of of is actually one

1150
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,879
which we call a research-based where

1151
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,239
you're just looking for that

1152
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,880
generalizable result that's actually

1153
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:57,598
done in field and that can be uh that

1154
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,640
can be distributed Ed much more widely

1155
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,798
but the result is is more General and

1156
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,400
less useful to individual Farmers so

1157
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:07,079
that I hope that answers your question

1158
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,358
but basically what I'm saying is the

1159
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,920
knowledge is a much more durable uh IP

1160
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:15,798
and value entity than either individual

1161
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,400
uh results

1162
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:20,559
uninterpreted or in some cases the

1163
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,400
research type of result it's the it's

1164
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
the knowledge and the distribution of

1165
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,318
the knowledge which seems to have

1166
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,759
particular value to

1167
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:31,838
and that can be spread but partially the

1168
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,280
technique can be spread anywhere but the

1169
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,400
the individual results you have to be

1170
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,400
more careful actually Distributing

1171
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,159
those this has been a production of

1172
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:51,160
Cornell University on the web at

1173
