1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,798
University hi everybody um I'm Josh

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,959
Randall I'm the natural resources

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,080
educator at Cornell Cooperative

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,000
Extension Niagara County um I'm going to

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,559
talk specifically about weatherization

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,480
of homes and then what that looks like

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
in terms of saving energy reducing

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
greenhouse gases and protecting Health

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,240
but I also serve as a clean energy

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
adviser with the Western New York clean

12
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,278
energy Hub so I have responsibilities

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,518
that I guess transcend that and are

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,079
really focused on residential

15
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,280
opportunities in general so if you have

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,079
thoughts on that um I will have a table

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,160
tomorrow at our uh energy Expo which

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,920
you're all definitely invited to come to

19
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:45,718
and we can talk more about some of those

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,679
residential opportunities um is it

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,800
not okay um so I know that Jenny

22
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,799
actually covered a few of these terms

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,198
but I always like to try to make sure

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,358
everybody's on the same page when we

25
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,759
have these kinds of conversations um you

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,000
know so just going through really

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,000
quickly you know the idea that we're

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,280
going to talk about here is in the

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,600
background these are some of the ideas

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,600
that we should have we're thinking about

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,439
these things so climate change these are

32
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,560
just long-term changes to stability or

33
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,798
predictability of weather sustainability

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
is the use of resources without

35
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,439
endangering our future Generations

36
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,559
availability resiliency is ability for a

37
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:16,879
system or an individual to bounce back

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,759
from unexpected changes environmental

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,280
justice is equitable distribution of

40
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,118
environmental resources and contaminants

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,640
and decarbonizing is the red reduction

42
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,200
or of the amount or intensity of

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,040
greenhouse gases released by a process a

44
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,520
building any kind of thing um but most

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,118
importantly the thing that I'm going to

46
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,759
talk to you about today is

47
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,118
weatherization um and so what is

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,719
weatherization Jenny gave a very brief

49
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,680
explanation of this but I like pictures

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,840
um so I have a diagram for you guys to

51
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,840
think about so let's imagine we have a

52
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,118
very basic house um there's a door

53
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,960
there's a window there's a roof and you

54
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,200
can even note there's actually ways I'm

55
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,640
not tall enough um to be able to see how

56
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,960
there's actually air moving up into that

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,840
roof through those um through those

58
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,000
little openings there and so what's

59
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,520
really really important to think about

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
then is that every single place where

61
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,399
you have hole in the house that's a

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
place for air to move in or out so that

63
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,239
means in the summer you're losing your

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,598
AC and in the winter you're losing your

65
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,799
heat and also more importantly the real

66
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,679
risk to people that we'll talk about

67
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,920
later is that means that any outdoor air

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
pollution immediately becomes indoor air

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,518
pollution um and so what do we do about

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
that well we weather eyes so that can

71
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,239
look like a few different things so um

72
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,039
you know the really biggest priorities

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,280
are actually going to be focused on the

74
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,120
top of the house so this could be

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,598
something like adding bats of insulation

76
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,800
or adding baffles to be able to control

77
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,238
the air is Flowing it could mean adding

78
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,319
additional insulation in the walls and

79
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,000
rim joist it could mean adding door

80
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,839
sweeps or uh or adding um additional air

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
ceiling along the bottoms of windows so

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,158
there's a lot of different places that

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
we can try to prioritize we should

84
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,840
really be thinking about this as a whole

85
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
system um and especially since we're

86
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,158
thinking about things as whole systems

87
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
we can then try to think about how this

88
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,598
might affect other kinds of systems and

89
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,919
that's why I'm going to start talking to

90
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,158
you a little bit about Health Energy

91
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,839
economics and environmental outcomes of

92
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,399
weatherization

93
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,959
a little bit of historical background um

94
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,799
this is Jenny's favorite figure she

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,840
loves to show this but this is actually

96
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,400
really um you know a really great

97
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,319
breakdown of what's going on in New York

98
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,719
state right now you know as we know

99
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,919
buildings and transportation are the

100
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,199
biggest components of our uh greenhouse

101
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,238
gas inventory however if you make a good

102
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,119
a quick note actually the green is also

103
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,039
energy and that means that that energy

104
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,080
has to also be a part of that

105
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,479
transportation and building um

106
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,519
components that really means that we're

107
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,518
we're really thinking about in people's

108
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,360
individual day-to-day lives more than

109
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,840
50% of the greenhouse gas emissions are

110
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,680
coming from um so we can't exclusively

111
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,158
think about this as being a problem that

112
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,840
our our large corporations and

113
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,120
businesses have businesses have to deal

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
with it's something that we have to be

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,640
able to take on as a society and so as a

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
result the climate leadership and

117
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,279
Community protection Act was passed in

118
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,878
2019 by New York State and it resulted

119
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,000
in the creation of a scoping plan and

120
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,679
that was really um some really big uh

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,719
you know requests and specifically they

122
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,599
wanted to see that we could have 85% %

123
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,878
uh of greenhouse gases reduced by 2050

124
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,639
and that could look like a lot of

125
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,078
different things and especially one of

126
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,719
the things that they mentioned directly

127
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,840
in that scoping plan is that one to two

128
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,120
million households across New York state

129
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,120
are really going to actually need to be

130
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,160
electrified with heat pumps by 2030 to

131
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,478
be able to reach our goals so that means

132
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,479
that we really need to be thinking about

133
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,800
this in terms of how our people in this

134
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,120
room in our communities across the state

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
going to actually be able to meet these

136
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,000
goals weatherize their homes and

137
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,038
actually be able to achieve

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,839
electrification

139
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,000
and most importantly we also have to

140
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,918
think about this in the lens of a just

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,240
transition New York State explicitly

142
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,839
States this in the scoping plan that we

143
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,879
must be we must ensure that

144
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,159
disadvantaged communities receive at

145
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,079
least 35% of all of the benefits that

146
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,600
New York state produces through their

147
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,240
expenses on this this sort of work and

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,759
really I think this is one of the more

149
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,038
important things is that disadvantaged

150
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,319
communities is a very broad term that

151
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,199
New York State actually uses and it

152
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,639
includes things uh places like um low

153
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,720
and moderate income people in and areas

154
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,960
as well as communities that had land use

155
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,080
associated with historical

156
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,680
discrimination or disinvestment and

157
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,879
that's like a really big phrase but

158
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,959
really what that means is that people

159
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,478
and places that were a part of the way

160
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,038
that we developed the state have to be

161
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,719
able to be the ones that actually get

162
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,639
the benefits from us further developing

163
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,520
the state this is a picture of Western

164
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,360
New York because that's where I work um

165
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,758
and these are actually in blue all the

166
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,520
places that New York State considers to

167
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
be disadvantaged communities and the

168
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,000
thing I want to highlight is that

169
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,478
essentially entire city of Buffalo the

170
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,038
city of Niagara Falls the city of

171
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,359
Lockport are all considered

172
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,038
disadvantaged but so is the tusor nation

173
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,000
the katar Aus nation and the in the

174
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:43,560
Tanana um uh reservation and so what we

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
really have here is some of the areas we

176
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,800
would normally think about but even more

177
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
interestingly you see a lot of Agland is

178
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,720
also considered to be a disadvantaged

179
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,199
community and that's why we have to

180
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,560
think about this is not just the people

181
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,000
that you know normally get considered in

182
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,478
these in these conversations but it's

183
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,918
it's a much bigger pool of people that

184
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,120
have to be involved in the

185
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,519
decision-making and like I said before

186
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,000
this means that the communities that

187
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,318
became disadvantaged as a result of the

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,319
externalized costs of development have

189
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,199
to be a part of the modern development

190
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,199
as a part of the remedy so the the

191
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,280
groups the people the places that

192
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,800
actually received the sort of uh

193
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,758
disadvantage nature because of dis

194
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,560
because of disinvestment or

195
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,360
discrimination have to be the ones to

196
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,639
see the 35% of the

197
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,680
benefits okay so now I'm going to talk

198
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,280
about energy um this is a really

199
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,759
important map right there on the right

200
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,279
that's actually New York state is from

201
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,400
energy star so that's how they kind of

202
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,758
think about um how much insulation

203
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,758
people need that's sort of like the the

204
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,879
bare minimum idea so they they they

205
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,639
group the state into a bunch of

206
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,918
different areas um and and so really

207
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,560
what that means is that there's there's

208
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,959
going to be diversity across the state

209
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,959
like in terms of what people actually

210
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,159
need um but still 90% of all homes in

211
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,560
the united states are considered under

212
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,400
insulated and especially like I said

213
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,319
this we have a diversity of insulation

214
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,159
needs but almost everybody in New York

215
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,319
state is needed is expected to need r60

216
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,120
in their attics and R14 in walls that R

217
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,360
stands for resistance value and so it

218
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,639
tells you how uh how how much the

219
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,639
insulation is able to resist the

220
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,160
movement of energy through it and so the

221
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,120
higher the number either the thicker the

222
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,160
insulation has to be or the the less

223
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,160
conductive that material would have to

224
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,039
be so what that really means is that

225
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,840
people are not seeing the insulation

226
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,038
that they need when they constructed the

227
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,198
house when they've done insulation in

228
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,639
the past and that really requires then

229
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,280
that we take it a little bit more

230
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,400
seriously and actually work to make sure

231
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,119
that insulation is happening um and

232
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,679
especially you know that it becomes even

233
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,598
worse when we consider that most addicts

234
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
only ever have floors insulated and

235
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,519
never the uh the actual ceilings and

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
crawl spaces and rim joist are

237
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,719
considered Dangerously uninsulated in

238
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,000
most places as well as the fact that New

239
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,319
York State actually worked to try to

240
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,199
remedy some of this with their stretch

241
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,639
energy go to 2020 but municipalities

242
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,158
have to individually approve that in

243
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
order for that to actually function

244
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,038
where they live so we actually have a

245
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,959
number of problems that actually made

246
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,680
worse because we also have an asbestos

247
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,839
insulation crisis and because some homes

248
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,879
will never be able to have wall

249
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,959
insulation if you have slat walls in a

250
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,360
wooden home so um saving energy is a

251
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,239
very difficult thing for a lot of parts

252
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,520
of the state and you know it also comes

253
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,960
down to a thing about who's even really

254
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,839
focusing on this um I'm really thinking

255
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,198
that this is that this saving energy

256
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,959
conversation really leads well into a

257
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
larger conversation about behavioral

258
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,198
change you know Ken gave a really great

259
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
talk there about what it looked like to

260
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,360
have that behavioral change in a

261
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,478
specific industry but we have to

262
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,719
potentially be thinking about this

263
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
across all Industries and all

264
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,680
communities so we turn out the light um

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,039
you know who actually cares about saving

266
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,039
energy um well there's a few people that

267
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,600
should think about it the most um people

268
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,079
that want to see the immediate financial

269
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,639
benefits for their household people that

270
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,160
want to see a more efficient grid and um

271
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,600
people that want to prolong the

272
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,240
mechanical electrical equipment in their

273
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,240
household your furnace your hot water

274
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,560
heater all of those things do better the

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,759
less uh the less intensely you use them

276
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,799
and so we really have to think about

277
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,078
energy saving as being part of these

278
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:07,039
normal behaviors that people already

279
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,679
care about we also know that utilities

280
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,679
are already seeking rate increases

281
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,199
across New York State because energy use

282
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,919
continues to increase across all times a

283
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,879
day and all seasons um in part because

284
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
of some Industries increasing their use

285
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,240
but also in part because New York State

286
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,480
continues to develop and expand um and

287
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,200
we also know that like I said buildings

288
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,560
are the largest category of emissions

289
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,480
and space heating is the largest

290
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,078
proportion of that building emission so

291
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,560
if you care about climate change or if

292
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,399
you care about financial benefits for

293
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,399
households you must care about building

294
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,240
decarbonization that did not fix itself

295
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,720
um so these were a couple of other

296
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
figures I wanted to make sure I threw in

297
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,759
here that kind of talk a little bit

298
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,239
about why energy saving is so important

299
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,039
in New York state especially so on the

300
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,639
left that's actually um from the um New

301
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,439
York State com troller I'm sorry and

302
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,838
that actually represents the percentage

303
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
of customers that are considered to be

304
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,440
in a rear by utility across New York

305
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,078
State and you can see even the minimum

306
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
which is um National Grid and Long

307
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:06,719
Island at least 8% of all the customers

308
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:10,759
are considered to be a rear in 2022 so

309
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,200
that's two years after covid um we have

310
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,679
a huge number of people that are in

311
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,560
financial uh Straits because of the fact

312
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,000
that they can't afford their energy and

313
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,278
it actually gets worse when you consider

314
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,879
that on the right that's from eia that

315
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,278
is the the number in in billions of

316
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,399
dollars of rate increases across the

317
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,838
United States across all the utilities

318
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,559
so we're seeing utilities are increasing

319
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,920
their rates people already can't afford

320
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,838
them and what are they actually going to

321
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,399
do they're going to have to look towards

322
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,760
weatherization okay I'm gonna talk a

323
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,639
little about greenhouse gases now to

324
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,838
switch it up um at the bottom there

325
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,399
that's actually I think a really

326
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,839
interesting figure so people can kind of

327
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,958
get an idea of how this stuff works and

328
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,839
I'll talk about it in a little bit but

329
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,199
um you know normally I'm I'm like I'm

330
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,360
trying to think about this in terms of

331
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
uh weatherization but a lot of this also

332
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,440
kind of leads into electrification and

333
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
especially that's where we see the most

334
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,839
benefits for greenhouse gases um and so

335
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,519
as we try to weatherize we have to

336
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,160
realize that a lot of this is going to

337
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,839
be in preparation for that but just

338
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,600
weatherization on its own is actually

339
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,920
able to reduce the total us emissions by

340
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,278
5% it's actually 4.7 exactly but so just

341
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,000
insulating homes across the US is a

342
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,078
massive reduction in our total

343
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,958
greenhouse gas inventory but we can also

344
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,359
then shift people better towards heat

345
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,239
pumps because we can actually be

346
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
realistic with what people actually need

347
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,519
with terms like right sizing and that's

348
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,959
what that figure in the bottom there so

349
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,560
that's considered to

350
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,958
approach number four so this would be

351
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,599
what you would consider how you would

352
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,599
design a heat pump in um Upstate New

353
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,959
York so what that really is saying is we

354
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,320
can try to make sure that the heat pump

355
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,958
is able to work at even low temperatures

356
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,959
without wasting too much energy at

357
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,278
higher temperatures and so you can

358
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,479
actually do this better if you've

359
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,600
already done the insulation if you've

360
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,920
already done the energy assessments and

361
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,159
so we have to be um we have to think

362
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,879
about this in

363
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,879
advance um and then like I said too like

364
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,720
we have to think about how this also

365
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,679
relates to a lot of our other movements

366
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,399
we're having we know that Refrigeration

367
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,319
is actually rapidly changing in New York

368
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,440
state and across the United States as we

369
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,959
start to uh phase out the worst

370
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,079
refrigerants but that's going to be a

371
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,000
process that's going to happen over and

372
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,159
over again but it especially is related

373
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,120
to this because we know that HVAC units

374
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,559
are some of the ones that contain those

375
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,000
most harmful greenhouse gases in

376
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,559
abundance and that whenever they get

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,720
repairs they get off gased so we have to

378
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,879
be ready to be able to do the

379
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,480
weatherization to be prepared for the

380
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,600
electrification but also know that

381
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,759
that's also a part of a bigger scheme of

382
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
how greenhouse gases are going to be

383
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,159
reduced these are another couple of

384
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
really interesting figures and I'll talk

385
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,159
a little about them as I go along um

386
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,879
what we also know is that as we're

387
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,480
reducing greenhouse gases people are

388
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,639
going to have tighter home envelopes and

389
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,560
that means that they're going to need to

390
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,839
rely Less on AC's which are already

391
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,679
considered to be grid heavy um as you

392
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,040
can see we're gonna the expectation on

393
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,638
that bottom right figure is that New

394
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,120
York State and that's actually from the

395
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,799
the New York a New York independent

396
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,959
service operator the New York State as a

397
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,719
whole is going to be moving from a

398
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,518
summer peaking system to a winter

399
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
peaking system by 2037 what that means

400
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
is that as a whole we're no longer going

401
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,480
to see our most energy use in the summer

402
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
we're going to see it in the winter most

403
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,240
of that is believed because we're going

404
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,000
to be shifting towards electric forms of

405
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,480
heating but it's also hopefully going to

406
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,159
be because people are able to actually

407
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
do the weatherization work and not have

408
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,759
to waste as much energy on air

409
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,799
conditioning um and it should also

410
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,360
should I can't promise this it should

411
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,799
also reduce dangerous and wasteful forms

412
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,000
of heating and cooling like leaving your

413
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,759
oven open or leaving a refrigerator door

414
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,639
open people die every single year from

415
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,559
doing this and that's a completely

416
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,320
avoidable death just through the use of

417
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,359
weatherization technology um it also is

418
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,120
going to mean that we could potentially

419
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,720
even out demand which means we might be

420
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,198
able to actually phase out the peer

421
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,879
plants which we were not able to do in

422
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,319
this next year so that's what that top

423
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,720
right map is that's where all the peer

424
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
plants are New York State what that

425
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,000
means is that when the grid hits Peak

426
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,839
load they have to turn on additional

427
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,039
power plants and you can see right there

428
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,440
in the middle of New York state that

429
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,078
giant gray blob that's a giant oil plant

430
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,079
so a lot of Upstate is still relying on

431
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,599
that and if you go down to State a lot

432
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,519
of that's all natural gas and then a

433
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
couple of pretty large oil plants we're

434
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,919
still very reliant on on fossil fuels

435
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,439
every time we hit those really intense

436
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,919
parts of the summer because people need

437
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
that

438
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,719
AC the last thing I wanted to talk about

439
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,560
is protecting health and this is

440
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,839
something I try to really um be the most

441
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,119
forward with when I'm talking with

442
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,079
people in my day-to-day work because I

443
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
think this is the thing that people

444
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,519
forget the most about you know like I

445
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
said Ken did a really great job talking

446
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,759
about how this works in terms of

447
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,600
landscaping industry but we know that

448
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,320
these are health concerns related to

449
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,920
fossil fuels related to the ways that

450
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,079
we've designed our society across the

451
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,120
board um so I'm going to give a quick

452
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,958
overview um one of these things is going

453
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
to be indoor indoor air quality like I

454
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,838
said outdoor air quality is the greatest

455
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
predictor of what indoor air quality is

456
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,399
going to be if we can reduce fossil fuel

457
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,559
use we're going to see better indoor air

458
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,240
quality but more importantly we can do

459
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,479
things like I said yeah reduce air

460
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,440
coming in we can also reduce mold growth

461
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
so we know that a large percentage of

462
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,040
the mold that's happening in people's

463
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,359
homes is because of under insul

464
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,958
insulation in attics we also know that

465
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
radon and rodent feces are coming up

466
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,119
through people's crawl spaces because

467
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,839
those are also under

468
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,959
insulated the next thing that we can

469
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,000
think about is ensuring that the

470
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,679
efficiency of our mechanical electrical

471
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,198
equipment systems is going to be able to

472
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,198
maintain themselves longer and the

473
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,240
reason why that's important is because

474
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:22,399
our car our our our sorry our equipment

475
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,639
increases carbon monoxide production as

476
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,639
they age and so especially if you're in

477
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,440
that in areas where you might have your

478
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,360
your furnace your hot water heater in an

479
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,959
area where you might be having it on the

480
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,440
same floor as where people are staying

481
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,638
that's a real danger to people as they

482
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,240
age um it also means we can maintain

483
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,000
higher water temperatures and reduce our

484
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,879
legionnaires risk we've had people in

485
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,278
the last year die in Albany because of

486
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,559
legionnaires and likely it's because we

487
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,519
were not able to keep that water

488
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,479
temperature at the at the prerequisite

489
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,519
um level and it was allowed to then grow

490
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,959
un uncontrolled uh we can also then

491
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,959
produce less thermal pollution we can

492
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,318
make sure that we're not going to be

493
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,679
increasing heat island effects in cities

494
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,278
by having all these buildings always

495
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,318
outputting all this excess heat in the

496
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,360
winter and we can reduce pest entrance

497
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:04,120
to the home we can try to reduce the

498
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,560
number of rats and stink bugs and flies

499
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,440
coming into people's homes just by air

500
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,278
sealing and the most important thing and

501
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,519
the reason why Buffalo cares about this

502
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,720
is we can make sure that there's more

503
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,360
hours of safety during extreme weather

504
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,278
we lost people in 2022 and that was were

505
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,360
also avoidable deaths just by increasing

506
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,679
weatherization so that's what I had to

507
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,560
have

508
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,359
um and that's all I have so yeah and I

509
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,439
know we're not doing questions now so

510
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,440
