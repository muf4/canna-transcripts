1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
i want to start off with a familiar

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,280
slide for everybody and that's the world

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,320
population growth from 1700 to 2100

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:20,559
its projections and its

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,160
growth rate and the main

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,839
this this population has and will

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,079
continue to play stress on agriculture

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,480
and the main point of this slide is that

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,198
to feed this population increase we're

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,599
going to need to

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,600
make agriculture more productive but

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,558
also more sustainable

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,558
as a as a major aspect of sustainability

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
we need to keep in mind that humans

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
already control

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,640
the majority of nitrogen and phosphorus

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
flows in the world

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
and so any any solution to

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
sustainability which is going to feed

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,519
right back into productivity

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
those those two uh those two goals are

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,480
not

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,238
uh exclusive are going to have to

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,599
any solution to sustainability is going

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,000
to have to focus

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,519
and to address nutrient management and

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,599
reuse

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,079
so how then can we use genetics to work

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,359
towards this

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,319
and really

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,519
going into us we think we can use

34
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,639
genetics

35
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,280
to change nutrient flow and so we can

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,079
move

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,799
from ghost focusing specifically back on

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,798
the mace

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,799
we can usually next to to change

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
nutrient flow and so we can go from

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
this conventional system where we're

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,719
taking our nitrogen phosphorus we're

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
fixing it from the air or mining it from

44
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,438
the lithosphere we're throwing it onto

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,759
the

46
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,118
onto our agricultural fields it's

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
absorbed by the plant

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,879
some of it's lost it's used for

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,560
photosynthesized

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,399
photosynthesis and then at the end of

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
the season it's

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,840
most of this nitrogen and phosphorus is

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
loaded into the kernels we come through

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
with our combines

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,640
we harvest it and then the nitrogen in

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
the form of protein and the phosphorus

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
and the starch and the grain are all

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
forwarded onto an end use

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
if we can if we look at this can we we

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
can use genetics to change

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
this nutrient flow and fundamentally

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,440
change what we're pulling off the field

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
and as part of that we need to view

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,639
we need to view our agricultural

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
production fields in

66
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,039
a lot of cases especially for industrial

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,400
ag as a place to farm

68
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,239
carbon and those nutrients as something

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
that we need to return to the soil each

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
year

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,400
and not really the goal of production

72
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,479
and so

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,159
can we then envision a system that looks

74
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,719
like this

75
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,159
where at the end of the season instead

76
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,280
of the nitrogen and phosphorus being

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,120
loaded into the kernels

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,039
we're harvesting the starch alone the

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,759
nitrogen phosphorus is trapped

80
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,000
within the calm we then take that

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,439
nitrogen and phosphorus we store it plot

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,680
or process it we reapply it and then it

83
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,199
becomes the primary fertilizer source

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,439
for

85
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,399
the next year's crop now no system's

86
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,598
going to be 100

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,000
efficient and so there would need to be

88
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,919
um for sure there would be supplemental

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,878
fertilizer that comes in each year

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,759
but if we could recycle 40 or 50 percent

91
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,560
of the nitrogen and phosphorus

92
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,840
that uh that are needed to keep the mace

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,199
field productive that would be a huge

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,360
decrease in the amount

95
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,639
that we need to fix from the atmosphere

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,319
or mine from the

97
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,878
lithosphere hopefully make mace

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,280
production

99
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:39,840
more sustainable and uh a contributor

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,959
a a helper towards mitigating climate

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
change instead of something that

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,439
contributes to it

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,878
and so when we're reimagining this and

104
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,039
using genetics to change

105
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
this nutrient flow there's two aspects

106
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,959
that need to be addressed

107
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,560
the first would be the end uses can we

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
get away with

109
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,598
leaving the nitrogen and phosphorus out

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
of

111
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,438
the maize end uses and then the second

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
would be

113
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,680
can we use genetics to actually do this

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,199
is the physiology in the genetics can we

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
can we make this happen and store

116
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,079
nutrients within the cob

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,959
during kernel loading and so

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
i want to talk about the end uses first

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,319
and if we look at may's end uses if we

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
take the 2019

121
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,680
maze harvest which is about 340 million

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,959
metric tons

123
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,519
of maize 40 of that goes into ethanol

124
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
production

125
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,719
and 40 goes directly

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
out of ethanol production the starch is

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,199
used is converted to sugar

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
and then into ethanol any component

129
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,520
that's not starch

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,960
comes out and this is is called stillers

131
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,839
grains or solubles

132
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,399
and those distillers grains are mostly

133
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,239
used

134
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,000
for animal feed and so we end up with

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,519
80 percent of the phosphorus and 80

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,120
percent of the protein

137
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,719
in may's grain being used

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
in animal feed so that ends up being

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
about a million metric tons of

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,360
phosphorus

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
about 30 million metric tons of protein

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,199
and so we need to address whether

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
in lifestyle feed we can eliminate these

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,000
two components

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
i would argue that for phosphorus we can

146
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
already

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
for sure we can we can decrease or even

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
eliminate it

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
in the base kernel with minimal effect

150
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,400
on

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,079
on in animal feeds and the reason that

152
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
it there's two reasons for that

153
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,359
one is that maize primarily stores

154
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,000
phosphorus as

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,080
phytic acid which is not digestible in

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
mono room and animals

157
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,359
this could be somewhat mitigated by the

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,639
addition of

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
phytase either by modifying

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,879
modifying genetically modifying these

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,280
animals to endogenous endogenously

162
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,319
produced phytase or by adding it to the

163
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,478
feed ration

164
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,519
but that doesn't address the second

165
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,560
issue

166
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,159
which is purely the amount of

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,839
phosphorus that these animals are being

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
fed

169
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,279
it's too much for them to use

170
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,719
effectively and absorb effectively and

171
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,839
so we end up with a large pool of

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
excreted phosphorus

173
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,680
and there's difficulty concentrating

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,360
that enough to make

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,319
movement of it to uh

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
to it's difficult to concentrate that

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
excreted phosphorus into a form that's

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,600
economically viable to move the

179
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:32,399
distances that's needed

180
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,439
um maize nitrogen so mace protein

181
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,519
is is more unclear the end use of this

182
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,519
definitely needs to be investigated more

183
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,879
so the digestibility and end use

184
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,879
is higher than in phosphorus

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
and protein is also used as

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,919
metabolizable energy

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,519
by these animals but that has to be

188
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,240
balanced with the fact that

189
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,598
half of the maize nitrogen is being

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,199
funneled through

191
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,199
ethanol production and the drying of

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,919
distillers grains represents a large

193
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,400
energy sink in an ethanol plant

194
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:10,079
and so this

195
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,239
on to the next point here projections on

196
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,639
the future of animal production

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
so y'all have probably all heard ed's

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
talk about where we're going to get

199
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,839
protein in the future and if that

200
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,679
happens

201
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,000
that's going to serve to decrease the

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,038
value of maize protein

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,680
freeing up freeing up

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:32,318
nitrogen for recycling on field

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
so one of the things that i would like

206
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
to do this year and i will be doing this

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
year is some engineering modeling and

208
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,598
economic modeling

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
to help us answer this question of where

210
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,038
of whether nitrogen

211
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,598
and when nitrogen will become available

212
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,079
for reuse

213
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
so moving on to physiology physiology

214
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,279
and the genetics real quick

215
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,959
i just want to point out that maize is

216
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,239
really well positioned to allow for two

217
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,120
product streams

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
kernels and cobs they're manageable size

219
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,478
and mass

220
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,799
and i also want to point out that the

221
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:07,439
mace cobb is mostly vascular

222
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,439
and structural tissue and

223
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,639
this storage of nutrients and vascular

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,959
and structural tissues is not new and so

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,960
the physiology of storing

226
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,719
nitrogen and phosphorus within the maize

227
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,399
cod is not something that's incredibly

228
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
outlandish this is

229
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,519
these are bark storage proteins and

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
populous and so

231
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,359
in the winter we can see that there's a

232
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,478
lot of protein storage vacuoles

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,399
and then in the summer those all

234
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,158
disappear because they've been removed

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
all that protein has been re-mobilized

236
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:40,319
for leaves for photosynthesis

237
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,200
focusing even with an even

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
with an even uh

239
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
even closer closer up image of these

240
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,958
protein storage vacuoles

241
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,559
we see that phosphorus is stored

242
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,719
in a very similar manner in these

243
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,799
perennial species as it is in

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,879
the maze kernel and so this begs the

245
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,639
question of

246
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,120
are protein storage and phosphorus

247
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,319
storage really evolutionarily

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,959
conserved and is it just the location of

249
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
the deposition

250
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,719
nitrogen and phosphorus would be

251
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,360
deposited in seeds whereas in perennials

252
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
it's stored in permeating tissues so

253
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,879
that it can be used year after year and

254
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,278
so

255
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,240
that makes the question is it

256
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,080
evolutionary con

257
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
evolutionarily conservative and can we

258
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
use that

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
to uh to develop a uh

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,278
a maze a maze plant that stores

261
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,159
nutrients in the cavity of the season

262
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,080
and so with that in mind the question

263
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,759
then becomes can we turn mace cops into

264
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
nutrient sieves such that at the end of

265
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,720
the season

266
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,599
that's intercepting and storing nitrogen

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
phosphorus

268
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
in the cob and preventing its loading

269
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,480
into the cross and

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,879
so as a concept it seems like this idea

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,159
would work

272
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,320
so focus further uh

273
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,319
further research and experiments would

274
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,959
need to be performed on this

275
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,879
so that's what we're hoping to look into

276
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,759
in the coming year and so this also begs

277
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,399
the question

278
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,278
does may store any nutrients in the cob

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,720
currently

280
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,399
at the end of the season the short

281
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
answer to that is is

282
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,639
no maize does not have any natural

283
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,759
variation for cod nitrogen at the end of

284
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,519
the season

285
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,399
and we would expect the same to be true

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
for phosphorus

287
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,559
and that's simply because it's an annual

288
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,240
plant there's no benefit to it

289
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,239
for mace to store any nutrients

290
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,959
because it won't be able to access those

291
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,440
easily in the next year

292
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,719
um it benefits to shunt all the

293
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
nutrients that it can

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,320
into the kernel and so

295
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
the accumulation of nitrogen and

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
phosphorus in the cob is going to

297
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,600
represent a challenge to genetic

298
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,599
modification

299
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,320
um it's going to require a lot of

300
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,800
research to implement

301
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,399
so appropriate modifications must be

302
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,000
identified and perennials can perhaps

303
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,958
serve as a source of inspiration

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,120
and genetics and so as we've seen with

305
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,159
the popular species

306
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,879
there is lots of uh there

307
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,838
there is storage of nutrients in

308
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,399
vascular system that we perhaps can

309
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,560
leverage

310
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,559
for

311
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,078
for the for the for the development of a

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,600
system

313
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,278
like this and so but perennials but

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
more closely related species may be

315
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,958
better better sources and so one of the

316
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,278
things that we're hoping to

317
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
do is we have tryptophan available in

318
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,360
the cornell fields

319
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,838
we're going to see what nitrogen storage

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,440
proteins

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,320
does trypsicum use

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,680
within its rhizomes to store nitrogen in

323
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
successive years and so

324
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,439
we'll do proteomic analysis in the in

325
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,919
the summer and the winter and look for

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,880
changes in relative abundance

327
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,000
and maybe we'll segment segment it out

328
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,360
and see if we can't find

329
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,799
where it's storing where it's storing

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,839
its nitrogen and

331
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,439
as part of that we can use these

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,920
the sequences of these proteins to

333
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
perhaps identify homologs and maize that

334
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,679
could be co-opted

335
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:19,120
or use those actual proteins

336
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,879
as sources for modification

337
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,278
so with that coming up on time i want to

338
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,559
acknowledge usda in the buckler lab and

339
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,078
i would love to have

340
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,078
your questions here

341
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,278
awesome thank you for that great talk

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,360
travis if anybody has a

343
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,360
question or two we have maybe a minute

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
some from mike gore could turning the

345
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,959
cobs into a nutrient sieve

346
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,040
work through alternating alternate

347
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,559
altering tissue specific regulation of

348
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,240
native maize genes

349
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,159
or would it require a transgenic gene

350
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,440
insertion approach so i

351
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,278
i do not know i would imagine that

352
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,639
something that i would imagine that it

353
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,078
might be possible

354
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
by alternating tissue-specific

355
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,399
regulation of native maize genes

356
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,199
but it might be easier to do using a

357
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,759
transgenic approach but i do not know

358
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
um one of the experiments that we would

359
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,078
love to do if we uh

360
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,039
if we can partner with some

361
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,919
with with any of these flight leading

362
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,039
companies

363
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,078
would be to express opaque two in the

364
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,958
cob and see what happens

365
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,359
so from kevin how many sessions of trips

366
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,958
to come

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
do you intend to look at and assess

368
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,599
natural variation for in storage and

369
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,239
horizons

370
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
we have

371
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,879
we're looking at it in about 10 sessions

372
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,479
and that's a pretty wide range we've got

373
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,679
fluorodonum and

374
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,480
the dactyloides and some of their

375
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,479
crosses as well

376
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,958
any uh anymore any more questions

377
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,719
feedback

378
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,399
and if we don't have time to ask a

379
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,920
question or to formulate

380
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,440
formulate a question please send me an

381
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,039
email i'd love to have feedback

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,279
push back on this idea um so

383
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,159
travis just real quick uh assuming you

384
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,320
you have all this p

385
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,000
and n in the cob do you just leave the

386
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
cobs in the field or you have to

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,440
harvest them and take them somewhere or

388
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,799
what do you do that would be a that

389
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
would be another aspect that would need

390
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,719
to be

391
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,198
need to be examined so there's

392
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,079
when you grow soybeans or when one grows

393
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,319
soybeans

394
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,638
the next year there's typically a yield

395
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
bump in maize

396
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,198
and the thought behind that is that the

397
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,278
uh the nitrogen and the root nodules

398
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,838
from the previous soybean crop

399
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,639
contributes to the available nitrogen

400
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,199
for the maize plant and uh increases the

401
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
soil

402
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,479
for that crop and so well

403
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
root nodules are pretty magnified tissue

404
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,079
just like a mace

405
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,560
cob there's differences for sure

406
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,479
but it might be that if we deposit the

407
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,000
nutrients within the cob the cob is a

408
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,759
lignified tissue that would

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
degrade slowly and provide sort of a

410
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,759
slow release fertilizer

411
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,399
for the maize crop but that would

412
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,679
require

413
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,480
more research and simply testing that

414
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,638
out

415
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,759
and it may be the case that the cobs

416
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,879
need to be harvested

417
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,439
and stored stored over winter and then

418
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,000
chemically processed in some manner to

419
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,839
make that

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,839
uh make the nnp available

421
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,919
hopefully that answers your question

422
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,919
there

423
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,480
awesome thank you again for that that

424
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,479
great talk travis and the great

425
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
discussion

426
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,600
this has been a production of cornell

427
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,159
university
