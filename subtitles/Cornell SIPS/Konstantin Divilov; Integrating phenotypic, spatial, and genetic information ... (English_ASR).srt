1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,509
University

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:16,679
thank you for the very nice introduction

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:19,109
this so quick seminar overview first

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,600
going to talk about disease resistance

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,260
bleeding in the Cornell great breeding

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,000
program then I'm going to talk about

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,118
three topics that are made up my

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,448
dissertation the first is using computer

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:37,859
vision to detect or quantify downy

11
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:39,960
mildew and leaf trichomes the next part

12
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,929
will be to integrate genetic information

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,480
snips in this case with multiple

14
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,420
phenotypes in something called the

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,109
Bayesian network and finally I'll talk

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:57,030
about accounting for spatial effects in

17
00:00:51,109 --> 00:01:01,369
field data with grapevines so just an

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,370
overview of grapes they're perennial

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,548
there are two main groups that we work

20
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,060
with Vitis vinifera which is the

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,299
European grapevine it's susceptible to

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,329
virtually a breed disease but it has

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,999
very good wine quality as well as

24
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:25,649
certain table grape attributes that we

25
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:27,718
want and the other group is various by

26
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:31,170
the species that are native to North

27
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:33,388
America and so these species are

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,609
resistant to nearly every disease

29
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:38,489
however they have really poor wine

30
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:41,179
quality however sometimes we do want

31
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:44,149
there our table great characteristics

32
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:46,439
and so the goal of the program is to

33
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,700
merge the best of both worlds

34
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:53,248
to obtain hybrids that have a high

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:02:01,759
disease resistance as well as high wine

36
00:01:53,248 --> 00:02:05,848
quality or table so how great breeding

37
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:12,750
works in the corner corner process

38
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:14,860
returned' then if markers we have

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:27,699
certain markers retreats

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:32,250
as disease resistance then those

41
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,250
seedlings plant the vineyard

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:44,590
after years of multi-location multi-year

43
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,750
trials of evaluating for field disease

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,159
resistance as well as wine quality the

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,629
best of those selections are releases

46
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,759
cultivars so the first bird I'll be

47
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,180
talking about you about is computer

48
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,639
vision so what is computer vision it's

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,099
using algorithms to extract information

50
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,339
that's from images that's usually

51
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:12,819
attracted using human vision and so the

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:16,560
pros is that there this method is

53
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:21,069
high-throughput I get a lot of data fast

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,219
that you could obtain quantitative

55
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:26,739
phenotypes and that there's a lot of

56
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:31,389
high-level programming libraries they're

57
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:33,519
available in order to implement these

58
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,099
algorithms for example the one I used

59
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,250
it's called open CV or open computer

60
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,069
vision some negatives with this method

61
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,530
it's time consuming to develop and it

62
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,620
requires technical knowledge from end

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:52,659
users which the phyto pathologists or

64
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:55,330
breeders indices so all about downy

65
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:58,269
mildew this is how it looks like so on

66
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,780
the left-hand side is the back seal side

67
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:06,310
of the leaf and this is where the oh my

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,340
seed infects this stomata and you obtain

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,680
sporulation

70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:17,069
and essentially for Vitis vinifera you

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,470
need to spray about every two weeks if

72
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:24,899
it's a really rainy year and so it's

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,410
calm you thought that this kind of

74
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:34,859
intensive pesticide application is no

75
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:36,960
longer sustainable so now I'll talk

76
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,350
about the genetic resources that I've

77
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:45,209
used to evaluate this method the first

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:49,020
is or both of them are interspecific f1

79
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:52,319
hybrids the first is bias group estrus

80
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:57,560
by horizon so virus repressors is a

81
00:04:52,319 --> 00:05:00,449
native Native American virus species and

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,120
horizon is an inter specific cross it

83
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:08,279
has Vitis vinifera in its background as

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:11,100
well as other virus Easy's and so for

85
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,869
both of these we have genetic Maps

86
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:21,000
available so there's about 6,000 snips

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:24,509
and the population size is 160 so I'll

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,300
call this family RH and other family is

89
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:30,899
horizon bye-bye the scenario the invited

90
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,620
scenarios of wild Vitus species and

91
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,978
what's special about this family is that

92
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,769
it has a back seal leaf trichomes so

93
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,909
there's two images of leaf disks per

94
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,939
family

95
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,710
the left-hand one is prior to

96
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:52,560
inoculation and on the right-hand side

97
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:55,228
believe this what it looks like the same

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,449
leaf this after inoculation so you could

99
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:05,909
see both of them the sporulation on both

100
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:08,279
but it's much harder to see on leaf this

101
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,640
when it has leaf trichomes and that's

102
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,129
because they believe trichomes are white

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,149
and sporulation zweite so it's difficult

104
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:21,779
to differentiate them and so the idea

105
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:25,379
that I'll use is using

106
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:30,019
the computer vision rating prior to not

107
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:34,709
religion as a co-vary to control or

108
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:37,049
belief trichomes and so the particular

109
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:41,669
last essay that we use as a leaf this

110
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:45,600
assay so basically we took leaf this or

111
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:48,840
took leaves from the field made leaf

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,960
this and plated them on an auger dish

113
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:57,239
and the leave this correspond to

114
00:06:51,959 --> 00:07:00,750
genotypes shown in the grid here the

115
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,910
experimental design here's for the RH

116
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:10,230
family we have controls and we did this

117
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:14,960
over two years 2015 and 2016 in 2015 we

118
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:18,270
had three experiments in 2016 we had two

119
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,659
for each experiment there was a time

120
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:25,769
series collection of data from three DPI

121
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:30,330
or days post inoculation to six DPI or

122
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:34,609
sometimes it was four dpi to seven dpi

123
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:41,819
if we didn't see sporulation after the

124
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:46,500
DPI so we collected four leaves from

125
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,079
each genotype and each leaf from each

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,769
leaf extract the two leaf this so for

127
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:56,759
each experiment we had about 1,400 and

128
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:59,159
so the only difference between our H

129
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,149
family and the HC family experimental

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,010
design is that in 2015 we only had two

131
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:12,870
experiments for the HC family and ours

132
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:14,699
just due to lack of time so we compared

133
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,519
the computer vision rating with a manual

134
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:21,750
rating so this is the scale it's a one

135
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,979
to five scale where one is no

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:28,680
sporulation and five is dense

137
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:33,120
formulation so

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:39,120
oh how we did the computer vision or

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:42,929
what algorithm did is that you have this

140
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,149
input image and what we want to do is

141
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,088
remove the background biography from it

142
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,190
as well as detect the leaf disks and so

143
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,959
this requires some user input of

144
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,970
parameters and so the next thing that we

145
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:01,109
want to do is if you notice on the

146
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,089
second row of belief this there's

147
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,899
greater illumination than in the first

148
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:11,279
row and we wanted we had to correct for

149
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,139
that and the somebody call it Wallis

150
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,549
filter check won't go into but

151
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:19,439
essentially corrects versus normalizes

152
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:24,990
the illumination across an image and

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,020
then we could detect the or phenotype

154
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,810
which in this case is the amount of

155
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:36,419
white pixels in belief this divided by

156
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:41,778
the area of a belief disk so now go into

157
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:47,699
the results first I'll just explain or

158
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:52,559
one experiment so here's the computer

159
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:57,629
vision ratings on the left hand side so

160
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,579
this cyan color is three days post

161
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,899
inoculation and so you could see it's

162
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,839
very close to zero

163
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:10,409
and then four days we get kind of the

164
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,560
distribution moves up as you get further

165
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:16,429
along in the days post occupation the

166
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:21,500
distribution keeps moving forward and

167
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:24,328
it's relatively normally distributed

168
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,669
however compare this to the manual

169
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:31,620
sporulation ratings you could see that

170
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:35,599
three DPI it's skewed all the way to the

171
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,600
one rating and

172
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,820
you get further along it skews towards

173
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:50,070
the five and so the ratings here are the

174
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:53,560
average the average of eight leave this

175
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:59,480
for a particular genotype add-on for an

176
00:10:53,559 --> 00:11:01,379
experiment so here are all the other

177
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,200
[Music]

178
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:09,899
distributions you can see the trend is

179
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,280
similar across experiments where it's

180
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,189
well that we normally distributed and

181
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,509
computer vision ratings

182
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,509
[Music]

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,629
looking at the correlations between

184
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,870
methods we see that the correlations are

185
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:36,509
very high and so this shows that our

186
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:41,190
method or computer mission method has is

187
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:43,980
accurate and obtaining a good phenotype

188
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:49,160
and you can see when we averaged across

189
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,159
genotypes the correlation increases

190
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:57,669
so now going onto the computer for the

191
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,550
HC family so this family had leaf

192
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:03,519
trichomes and so the computer vision

193
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:07,240
ratings were the ratings after

194
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,750
accounting for belief trichome computer

195
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,029
vision ratings which were simply the

196
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,190
computer vision ratings at two days post

197
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:21,879
inoculation prior to any sporulation on

198
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:27,640
leafless and so you can see that it's

199
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:31,240
not as clear in the computer vision

200
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:39,750
distributions that there's a general

201
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:45,250
trend of increasing sense for you lesion

202
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:48,519
however it's not as clearly defined and

203
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:53,919
for example in the first experiment at

204
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:57,970
seven a seven days post inoculation

205
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:01,539
it kind of moves down instead of you

206
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:06,490
know being close to five and six blue

207
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:09,159
and purple in the first graph however

208
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,960
for the manual sporulation readings are

209
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:18,870
again skewed or in the case of the

210
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:22,900
person just uniformly distributed

211
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:26,470
looking at the correlations they were

212
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:29,350
much lower averaging across genotypes

213
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,259
help increase the correlations a little

214
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:36,610
bit but not by a lot and for one

215
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:39,179
experiment the every all the days post

216
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,259
inoculation correlations weren't

217
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,229
significantly different than the zero

218
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:50,889
and the reason for that is we didn't get

219
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:53,830
a good reading of potentially the

220
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:56,319
computer vision reading Wilson didn't do

221
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,810
a good job in obtaining belief tricone a

222
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:04,240
true rating and so kind of the the use

223
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,439
of the co-vary didn't really work in

224
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,990
that

225
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,580
and so one way to improve it would be to

226
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,930
standardize illumination to maybe

227
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:23,269
improve obtaining that leaf Tricon

228
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:26,338
rating but to use as a as a covariant

229
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:29,419
there's a summary looking at the rating

230
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,249
of processing times over 1400 leave this

231
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:35,669
the manual visual rating took three

232
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:38,399
hours while the computer vision took 20

233
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:42,688
minutes so there's a great improvement

234
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:46,068
in how much she could phenotype and if

235
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:50,818
you want more information about this

236
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:54,269
vital pathology paper is out this for

237
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:58,458
this research and all the code is on my

238
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,459
github link shown below

239
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:06,899
so some future directions in this

240
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:11,339
research there's a comment by mornin the

241
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:16,739
last time I gave this talk about if you

242
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:20,429
see that da because of this parameter

243
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:25,319
search kind of need to set parameters

244
00:15:20,428 --> 00:15:28,980
where you detect all the leafless at the

245
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:34,618
same time which is really easy to do for

246
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:40,428
the RH family comes with it for the HD

247
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:42,749
family you still get like the detected

248
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:46,068
circles that are much smaller in some

249
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:47,759
cases so this method that's recently

250
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:51,628
been published

251
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,089
Els DC played around with it and seems

252
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:59,369
like a good way to remove this pram

253
00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:03,420
research another direction to go into is

254
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:06,990
to generalize phenotype detection for

255
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:09,269
example in this in my case I'm detecting

256
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:15,509
white pixels over what if the disease

257
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:20,129
was red if we could model the pixels is

258
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:24,709
coming from particular clusters then it

259
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:24,709
would could generalize this method

260
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:32,740
so reviewing are the phenotypes we

261
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:35,498
obtained for these two families we have

262
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,470
manual and computer vision sporulation

263
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:42,220
ratings going forward I'll just talk

264
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:46,360
about the manual sporulation ratings

265
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:50,079
because of the kind of problems we've

266
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:54,009
had you in the HC family with these

267
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:55,958
ratings and we also as I mentioned

268
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:59,110
collected the leaf tricone ratings at

269
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:03,219
today's post inoculation and we also

270
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,709
collected hypersensitive response or RH

271
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,110
ratings which were collected today's

272
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,339
post inoculation before any sporulation

273
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:17,139
and we're essentially the rating scale

274
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:20,198
is the detection of black dots which

275
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:24,788
represents necrosis so a rating of five

276
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:27,220
has dense necrosis so one of the

277
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:30,849
questions is what few notes actually use

278
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:35,169
for QTL detection we have eight readings

279
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:40,178
per genotype per experiment and how we

280
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:42,399
integrate this is with a mixed model so

281
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,240
our response in this case is the average

282
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:47,918
of eight ratings are fixed effects are

283
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:55,140
the intercept the experiments within

284
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:59,130
years and the leaf trichome ratings if

285
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,679
and belief track on ratings only for the

286
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:05,130
computer vision ratings for the HC

287
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,130
family

288
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:16,820
then we have random effect I ran in fact

289
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,279
of the breeding value or the genotypes

290
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:24,460
which here we assume that all the

291
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:30,289
genotypes are independent and we include

292
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:36,380
genotype by year effects again assuming

293
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:39,950
that the the years are independent and

294
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:45,140
we fit this using M rebel which is in

295
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:47,600
our package so the simplest QTL

296
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,900
detection is just using us the single

297
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:54,079
phenotype so use the term phenotype but

298
00:18:50,900 --> 00:19:01,730
I'm really going to use the breeding

299
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:07,309
value as my the response in this case so

300
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:10,490
the basic idea is you scan the genetic

301
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:13,069
map for significant snips and you

302
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:18,700
include them in your model and you keep

303
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:22,309
doing this until no more snips are so

304
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,950
this equation when a particular

305
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:27,889
phenotype equals an intercept plus snip

306
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:34,910
one multiplied by the fact of suit 1

307
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:39,110
plus snip 33 x by the effect of where

308
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:43,660
the sips are fixed effects and we did

309
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:46,009
this with our TTL in our package and

310
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,560
what I want to shoot this step is that

311
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,990
the QTL are often not robust when you

312
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,639
have a small population size so in this

313
00:19:50,990 --> 00:20:00,230
case we only have 160 individuals so say

314
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:03,590
you 10 or 10% you might end up with

315
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:08,180
different key TL so we kind of want

316
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:13,189
ideally method that's provides robust

317
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,289
GTR because when we're going to invest a

318
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,130
lot of effort and using them for

319
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,129
marker-assisted selection

320
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:32,470
so in order to essentially understand

321
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:37,720
how had phenotypes affect phenotypes our

322
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:41,049
phenotype is back or how gene or snips

323
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,079
affect multiple phenotypes one thing we

324
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:46,089
do is adjust that prior method and

325
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:50,139
simply scan for the most significant

326
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:53,740
snip or phenotype and so you could end

327
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:59,170
up with a model that's some phenotype

328
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:04,210
one is the response and is explained by

329
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:06,789
you know type two for example so in

330
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:13,960
order to do this we need to be sure that

331
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:14,529
we include effects that only kinda makes

332
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,370
sense

333
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:21,960
make biological or mechanistic sense so

334
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:26,529
for example if we have leaf trichomes

335
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:29,289
equal or being affected by correlation

336
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:33,339
in this case that doesn't make sense

337
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,970
because leaf trichomes were present on

338
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:41,049
the leaf

339
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:44,559
prior to inoculation and so the model

340
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:47,529
will not make sense and so we don't want

341
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:51,039
consider it and so an effective way to

342
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:53,200
do that multiple phenotype analysis is

343
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,500
by using something known as basing

344
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,970
networks so what these what you're doing

345
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,160
here is you're adding effects in

346
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,049
something called a greedy manner until

347
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,180
an additional longer increases the

348
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:08,259
network's basing information criterion

349
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,750
or bi C so I'll explain a few terms in

350
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:13,329
that sentence the first is what is a

351
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,109
network it's multiple separate linear

352
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:21,789
models one per phenotype so these will

353
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:26,049
just only be fixed effect linear models

354
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:28,000
the bi C is the likelihood of a

355
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,369
particular model subtracted by a

356
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,259
penalization term which is a function of

357
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:35,769
the population size and the number of

358
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:38,740
parameters in that model the network's B

359
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:42,819
I see is simply a sum of individual

360
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:46,839
models individual model BICS and gree

361
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:49,599
addition means the addition of an effect

362
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:55,990
to a particular model that increases the

363
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:57,699
network's B I see the most and so the

364
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,559
the reason they're called Bayesian

365
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:03,910
networks is simply because we're using

366
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:08,859
the basing information so now I'll give

367
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:10,870
an example of how this is done so assume

368
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:13,779
we have two phenotypes correlation and

369
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:17,949
HR or hypertension or hypersensitive

370
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:19,389
response and two snips and so these

371
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,049
orange arrows represent all possible

372
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:28,450
effects so immediately will not attempt

373
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:33,909
to account for the effect of sporulation

374
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:37,529
on HR because spoil because HR appears

375
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:41,009
prior to sporulation and we do not allow

376
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:45,808
phenotypes to affect genotypes

377
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:48,298
so then we essentially go one by one

378
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:51,450
with these effects and asks which one

379
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:56,250
increases the network's B I see the

380
00:23:51,450 --> 00:24:00,690
greatest and this is a hypothetical

381
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:05,029
example just snip two effects at the

382
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:09,720
most and we do this again asking every

383
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:13,710
which estimating every effect and asking

384
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,589
which one increase the IC so it's this

385
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:21,860
one in this case then it's this one and

386
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:21,859
then we come up to a point where no more

387
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,470
no addition of any of these arrows

388
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:33,090
increases the b IC of the model and so

389
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,370
you're left with the two left the two

390
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:38,879
models which this network represents

391
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:43,649
which is that sporulation is affected by

392
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:49,370
HR which is this arrow and snip - and HR

393
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:56,360
is affected by sleep - only she has

394
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:59,869
sporulation and HR so this method is to

395
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:03,269
computationally intensive to do with

396
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:05,129
thousands of steps so we select a non

397
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,668
redundant set of steps for each

398
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,919
phenotype and it's the name of that set

399
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:13,429
is called the Markov blanket so we'll

400
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,669
have one Markov blanket for each

401
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:20,820
phenotype so then we construct 1,000

402
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:24,980
networks using random sets of 90% of the

403
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:28,139
genotypes views for both our H and CHC

404
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:33,089
families then we merge all the networks

405
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,759
in one where we only keep the facts that

406
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:41,449
appeared in at least 50% of the networks

407
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,450
and we do this with the BN learn package

408
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:50,730
so the results for the RH family so you

409
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:52,199
could simply represent any linear model

410
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,779
with in this network

411
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,730
representation so I'll just do that for

412
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:02,129
the single phenotype ETL analysis

413
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:05,700
results and so the difference only here

414
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:10,020
is that the phenotypes will not affect

415
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,700
each other and the single analysis so

416
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,879
what we see in the Bayesian network is

417
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,710
that there is no effect of HR on

418
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,760
sporulation just the only possible

419
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:27,090
phenotype interaction that I allowed and

420
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:30,379
that the sniff generally found or are in

421
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:33,869
the same chromosome so if you are

422
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,480
similar however the main difference is

423
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:43,109
that in the single phenotype detail

424
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:47,039
analysis sporulation trade had many more

425
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:51,058
keep y'all found word and basic Bayesian

426
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:55,230
network it's a little bit more

427
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:58,079
interesting in the HC family where we

428
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,789
found that each type owns have a

429
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:05,129
negative effect this red arrow on

430
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:14,428
sporulation and HR and HR had a positive

431
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:19,650
effect on sporulation and so we don't

432
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:22,920
know why this is the case but for belief

433
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,700
trichome negative effects on the disease

434
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,620
phenotypes

435
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:32,519
it's hypothesized that it forms a

436
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:37,289
physical barrier between the spores of

437
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:44,690
the home IC and the stomata on the back

438
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:49,980
side of the leaf and that would prevent

439
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:53,460
spores from germinating and looking at

440
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:56,539
the single phenotype QTL analysis

441
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:00,090
it's somewhat uninformative because all

442
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:03,269
the phenotypes were explained by the

443
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:08,809
same two QTL in chromosome chromosomes

444
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:12,119
by Vinnie so the question is you know

445
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:14,690
what's really going on there and the

446
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,849
Bayesian network kind of explains that

447
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:20,759
but otherwise the QTL are similar and

448
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:23,789
could see seven affecting exfoliations

449
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:29,700
found here and the cutie on chromosome

450
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:33,659
six affecting EHRs also summarize this

451
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:36,120
the disease resistance in the two

452
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,240
families is controlled by multiple QTL

453
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:42,239
and they only account for a small

454
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,779
percent of the phenotypic variants that

455
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,569
breeding four-leaf trichomes as well as

456
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:51,960
other QTL would could possibly lead to

457
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:55,669
durable resistance again because you

458
00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:01,289
have that physiological type of

459
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:04,710
physiological barrier mechanism and say

460
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:08,490
a mechanism that's biochemical where

461
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:13,350
there's say necrosis occurring to stop

462
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:15,390
in action Bayesian networks are one way

463
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,789
to integrate multiple phenotypes with

464
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,680
genetic data as we've seen and one

465
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,319
question is are basing networks better

466
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,500
models Turner's to do this we would need

467
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:29,329
to perform cross validation so I haven't

468
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,920
done that formally but preliminary D

469
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:36,149
experiments do suggest that basing

470
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,028
networks are just using single

471
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,519
phenotypes

472
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:45,058
so now I'll move on to accounting for

473
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,649
spacial effects in vineyards so as I

474
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:52,079
mentioned we commonly phenotype in the

475
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:56,158
field as opposed to in the lab as the

476
00:29:52,079 --> 00:30:00,089
previous methods did and it's commonly

477
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,289
done in unreplicated vineyards although

478
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:04,168
not in all cases

479
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:06,569
so some assumptions one can make is that

480
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:09,500
the phenotypes that we measure the best

481
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:11,490
representation of the meaning values

482
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,409
another assumption is that the

483
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,409
phenotypes are corrupted by a complex

484
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:19,139
function of soil microclimate and

485
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:22,769
genetics this is likely the case however

486
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:26,849
the problem with this is that we really

487
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:29,190
don't have the data to fit this model

488
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:34,709
because we don't do not have meter by

489
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:38,130
meter soil data in our vineyards so one

490
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:45,298
could use the location of the vines as a

491
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:50,330
proxy for that and so that's essentially

492
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:54,450
what we're gonna gonna use a mixed model

493
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:57,119
here the response would be corrupted

494
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,649
phenotypes or what I'll call corrupted

495
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,408
phenotypes which is simply the

496
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:03,629
phenotypes that are measured in the

497
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:08,220
field and that's going to be explained

498
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:13,610
by some spatial effects and the noise

499
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:15,600
will be our uncorrupted phenotypes and

500
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:18,869
so the spatial effects will be

501
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,369
controlled by this L matrix it's

502
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:24,148
somewhat similar to a genetic

503
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:27,148
relationship matrix instead of this

504
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,798
matrix being a function of snips it's

505
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:32,879
going to be a function of the location

506
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:36,898
of the vines in the field and so there's

507
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:41,070
a number of ways you can encode this but

508
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:45,028
I'll just talk about two one is called

509
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:47,158
moving average covariance model and

510
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:51,109
others not are aggressive and they're

511
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:56,550
commonly used in time series analysis

512
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:59,279
so to explain these models I'll have a

513
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:04,829
really simplified example where I have

514
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:09,450
four vines in a row and I'm gonna see

515
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:12,029
how or what covariance is these various

516
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:16,069
models give so the simplest one is

517
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:18,329
called a moving average one model where

518
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:24,629
you're only modeling the covariance

519
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:29,730
between adjacent binds and this you

520
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:33,900
could see the encoding of this of the L

521
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:39,539
matrix here where this a which is a

522
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:43,910
value between 0 &amp; 1 is kind of the

523
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,909
covariance between the first and second

524
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:53,759
vine and and goes down the diagonal so

525
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:55,920
this can you represent the gear so

526
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,829
moving average to milos a little more

527
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,960
complex where neighboring vines are

528
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:06,449
explained by a plus a times B young bees

529
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:11,039
value between 0 &amp; 1 that we're going to

530
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:14,069
optimize and B and the covariance

531
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:19,740
between the first and third vine is a

532
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:24,210
value and here's the corresponding

533
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:28,140
covariance matrix another regressive one

534
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:31,230
is simply saying that there's an

535
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:34,140
exponential decline or an exponential

536
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:38,180
decay of covariance as you go as you go

537
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:42,420
further along so neighboring vines have

538
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,519
covariance of a then the next one then

539
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,990
between the first and third is a squared

540
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:52,529
and between the first and fourth is a

541
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:55,799
cube and so because it is between 0 &amp; 1

542
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:59,168
is to go further along even good you're

543
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,819
gonna have coherence is closer to 0

544
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,990
so then you have an autoregressive -

545
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:09,108
which is a little more complicated

546
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:12,349
essentially you could the easiest way to

547
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:17,358
think of it as as combining two

548
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:20,750
autoregressive one covariances so again

549
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:23,779
you have this B parameter now however if

550
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,628
you said B equal to zero it's going to

551
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:32,540
revert back to an AR 1 co variance and

552
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:38,648
so here this l1 is simply this value and

553
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:45,980
L 0 is 1 and so the covariances are

554
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:50,500
really to the previous covariances so to

555
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:54,980
evaluate how well these models perform

556
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:58,880
a data set which is again an F 1 in a

557
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:02,358
specific cross similar to the the

558
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,010
previous crosses explained there's six

559
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:09,019
rows here and 110 binds with in a row

560
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,390
I'm only going to model the covariances

561
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:14,809
within a row because the small number of

562
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:17,539
rows that we have there's four hundred

563
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:19,429
seventy four hundred seventy five bonds

564
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:23,389
that have been phenotype for powdery

565
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:28,849
mildew on a one to five scale in 2002

566
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:30,589
and 350 of them have genetic data so how

567
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:32,299
I'm going to do this evaluation is I'm

568
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,710
going to fit that mixed model they're

569
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,350
explained previously

570
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,559
and with the uncorrupted phenotypes I'm

571
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:42,019
going to do a qtr analysis and I'm also

572
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,119
going to do leave 10% out cross

573
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:47,960
valuation so what that means I'm going

574
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,280
to use 10% so I'm going to use 90% of

575
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:59,170
the genotypes that have genetic we're

576
00:35:51,280 --> 00:36:03,560
phenotypes Abnett data as in this model

577
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:05,780
and so this model is essentially G block

578
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:10,039
which is again another mixed model we

579
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:12,510
are similarly how we had that spatial

580
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,719
covariance matrix we now just have

581
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,360
the genetic covariance matrix as

582
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:21,239
explained by van Raden and then we

583
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:26,510
predict the test genotypes with the

584
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:29,849
parameters estimated from that model and

585
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:32,430
we're going to compute an accuracy score

586
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:38,009
which is the Pearson correlation between

587
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:40,299
the predicted and true uncorrupted or a

588
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,940
corrupted

589
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,789
so looking at the results spatially

590
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:49,179
unadjusted and adjusted you know types

591
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:52,179
detected the same three QTL in the same

592
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:56,469
locations looking at the genome-wide

593
00:36:52,179 --> 00:37:01,389
prediction results the accuracies there

594
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:05,139
was an increase whether use an a an MA

595
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:09,150
one or earth or any moving average or

596
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:11,859
autoregressive covariance function

597
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,340
however the standard deviations were

598
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:19,510
quite high and so these this increase

599
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:24,660
was not so sophisticated looking on how

600
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:28,180
well the covariance matrix fit the data

601
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,920
and they are one in the nature to here

602
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:33,099
fit the best but they actually fit the

603
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,010
same because they are two reverted to an

604
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:39,579
AR one because the B parameter was set

605
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:42,310
to zero during optimization of in this

606
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:47,579
case log marginal likelihood or this is

607
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:50,889
what Rommel optimizes or what Rommel is

608
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:52,960
so I have two more data sets in this

609
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:55,869
case I do not have genetic data so I'm

610
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,960
just looking at how well they fit well

611
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,469
the covariance matrices fit the data so

612
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,990
again they're both f1 interspecific

613
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:09,489
crosses the first one has four O's 76

614
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:12,819
binds per row again only modeling

615
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:15,069
covariances within rows about 300 vines

616
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,120
were genotype again for powdery mildew

617
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:23,590
in 2017 the second vineyard had three

618
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:27,279
rows 61 binds within those about 200

619
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:29,110
binds second-year vines were phenotype

620
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,600
for height and so these vines were not

621
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:38,230
never trimmed and so we could in this

622
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:43,420
case so there was

623
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:46,659
here that a or two covariance functions

624
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:51,000
that the best because they had the

625
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:54,219
greatest log marginal likelihood so

626
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,539
summarize the thousand two Perry mill

627
00:38:54,219 --> 00:39:02,169
the data said do not show a significant

628
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:06,550
benefit to just for phenotypes or will

629
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:10,450
be good to have some more vineyard data

630
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,880
where we could look at into this

631
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:18,699
especially one where the term deviation

632
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:20,858
isn't so high and that they are process

633
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:25,239
processes usually fed been your data

634
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:28,059
better than moving average processes so

635
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,889
just going back to our overview of

636
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:30,340
grapevine breeding out where this

637
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:33,480
research

638
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:39,180
it's an the high-throughput genotyping

639
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:44,579
using computer vision helps us being

640
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:48,190
faster phenotypes for f1 families and

641
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:51,900
this is where we get our markers that we

642
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,900
use for marker-assisted selection and

643
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:01,869
accounting for spatial effects could

644
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:10,079
possibly be to more representative

645
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:14,200
accurate QTL or ratings in the field and

646
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:18,549
the Bayesian networks for example

647
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:26,129
occurred suggest what Ian types should

648
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:28,710
generally breed for if we want I like

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,789
Jimmy let me ask one question Constantin

664
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:23,400
do you think the work that you did on

665
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:24,809
the Bayesian network analysis do you

666
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,530
think that could have been applied to

667
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:31,309
many tech studies and qto QTL analyses

668
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:36,840
and buy this or do you see that

669
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:41,789
applicable to the most QTL analyses no

670
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,789
because in most cases we only had I feel

671
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:49,199
most studies only had one phenotype and

672
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:54,779
I don't think there's a benefit when

673
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:57,949
there's just a single phenotype I think

674
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:01,200
the model will be very similar to what

675
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:03,710
you get with that single phenotype QTL

676
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,710
analysis

677
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:13,389
did you try using multiple rows instead

678
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:18,049
of just within row spatial adjustment

679
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:21,199
accounting for the the six so you said

680
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,600
you had multiple rows yeah

681
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,839
did you try combining the information in

682
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:32,269
those rows in your spatial analysis yeah

683
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,860
and it actually decreased again it

684
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:37,670
wasn't significant just because of the

685
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:42,640
high standard deviation but I think the

686
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:45,019
issue there is that the we would have to

687
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:50,929
sorry I guess I didn't mention this is

688
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:53,920
that the space between between vines

689
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:57,440
within a row is different than the space

690
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:02,019
between rows and so we're going to need

691
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,019
different a and B parameters when we fed

692
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:13,460
between row covariances and since we

693
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:16,519
only have six vines or sorry because we

694
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:22,220
only have six loads those parameters are

695
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:27,309
likely not to be late yes really well

696
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:27,309
estimated which I feel is what happened

697
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:49,039
oh yeah so technically Vitis vinifera

698
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:57,109
has leaf trichomes but they're

699
00:43:49,039 --> 00:44:02,860
practically not seeing a belief this

700
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:06,920
image actually but those really dense

701
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:11,710
leaf trichomes they do are never present

702
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:17,930
and Vitis vinifera the their present and

703
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:22,010
certain of vitae species like a scenario

704
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:30,619
and a Brassica just saying today I think

705
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:34,460
they're it's the most common so it's not

706
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:42,440
not all while species have these vents

707
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:45,190
leaf trichomes but just some dude the

708
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,450
interesting thing about the trichomes is

709
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,260
servants most that is just on the

710
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:51,859
inheritance

711
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:54,500
trade lines - I think some of them some

712
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:57,050
of your analyses pointed to the

713
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:01,969
inheritance patterns of trichomes and

714
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:06,320
they're also related to the ecological

715
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:08,689
niche in which certain types of types of

716
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,450
predatory mites insist on great weights

717
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,760
so you actually encourage certain

718
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:17,179
predatory mites to live on great needs

719
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:23,180
just by reading code for our trichomes

720
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:30,369
entities there's a nation images okay

721
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:32,739
well the GEMA question well

722
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:34,859
more questions thank you for coming to

723
