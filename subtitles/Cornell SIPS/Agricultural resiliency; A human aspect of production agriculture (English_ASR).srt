1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,849
what I am going to try to do is

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,009
basically split today into two different

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,808
presentations I do want to talk about a

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,149
resiliency project that Trevor and I are

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,439
working on and I'll get into that here

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,868
shortly because we're wrapping up our

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,820
research i'm actually he and i are in

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,559
process of doing final report for that

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,849
and then i am going to talk a little bit

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,949
about AG education because what

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,469
intrigued me when when I talked to Don

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,500
originally is probably trying to fit how

15
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:37,829
myself as an educator ends up in or

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,420
feels comfortable in the horticulture

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,579
section and give you a little better

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,950
feel for why I think that's a pretty

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,469
solid fit and hopefully going forward we

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,660
can continue to develop that so to state

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,089
it'll be about half and half if all goes

22
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:53,039
well Trevor will have to wave at me if

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,520
I'm going too slow on the research

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,769
project so the first one is is the

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,750
report from a resiliency growth project

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,880
that were just wrapping up we probably

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,438
really get kicked off in january of this

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,509
year folks involved in that trevor is a

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,839
graduate student and myself is principal

30
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:15,569
investigator we do have Betsy bin who's

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,040
based in Geneva also member the

32
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,989
horticulture field that's co-pi on it

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,570
dr. nancy wells is a human ecology and

34
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,030
is working with trevor as his primary

35
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,639
chair and has been involved mark smith's

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,379
been very involved in our initial

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,109
establishment and thinking about the the

38
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,519
research keith Tidball from eden has

39
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,500
also been a collaborator throughout

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,929
because we've been using his resource

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,728
base and we're actually hitting topics

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,040
that are very near and dear to eden as

43
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,629
it comes up in our discussion Caroline

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,110
Quentin was an outstanding undergraduate

45
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:52,649
of mine who I didn't know until we got

46
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,409
going is absolutely talented in coding

47
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,000
interview texts so she took right off

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,530
with that and was a great deal of help

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,150
so I have to give a shout out to her as

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,579
well it's funded by empire state

51
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,020
development I give credit to Betsy is

52
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,728
the one that kind of flagged this at me

53
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,978
hey this is a project that's getting

54
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:12,090
ready to move down the pike do you want

55
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:14,519
to get involved with it it's its primary

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,590
primary emphasis to get into that is

57
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,659
basically stemming from a whole series

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,819
of pretty

59
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,150
severe storms that we've had starting

60
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,459
with Hurricane Irene including hurricane

61
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,099
sandy and Lee and then we had early

62
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,250
spring and really late frost in 2012 we

63
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,900
had unusual flooding and Penn Yan that

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,270
they didn't see coming because it was it

65
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,890
was basically not something they never

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,870
really planned on or experienced before

67
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,539
and then we had while we're in the

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,289
middle of this we had the buffalo severe

69
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,509
severe snow fall event in 2014 that was

70
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,340
the impetus it was back in Irene and Lee

71
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,909
was the original driving force for the

72
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,370
funding from the Empire development

73
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,329
agents our group to do a little bit of

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,819
studying on the idea of resiliency

75
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,410
within our agricultural sector what do

76
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,780
we need to do and what are we where we

77
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:10,799
currently at in terms of resiliency in

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,229
that particular arena specific weather

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,730
impacts that we start looking at half of

80
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,729
Orange County's cultivated land was

81
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,769
damaged in Irene crop losses just an

82
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,209
ulcer colony where about five million we

83
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,450
didn't have numbers but from the

84
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,680
Schoharie action report the the farms

85
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,289
are devastated a lot of animals were

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,270
lost basically the entire infrastructure

87
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:31,889
was underwater we got a friend of mine

88
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,770
whose house was under 14 feet of water

89
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,509
in schoharie Valley they had a lot of

90
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,130
issue with fall crop damages that the

91
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,989
crops were there but they were so silted

92
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,419
in they had to rethink how to harvest

93
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,060
and could they harvest it was it was

94
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,099
really pushing them beyond the realm of

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,750
anything they'd experienced in severe

96
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,159
weather and trying to react to that and

97
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,409
bounce back potential impact I had Jim

98
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,859
held from empire development pull some

99
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,750
numbers if we totally wiped out and this

100
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,160
is specific to the regions that we use

101
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,319
for focus groups I'll show the next

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,659
slide so these numbers are very very

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,359
localized to specific counties that we

104
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,770
were working with pulled out basically

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,070
we're looking at about a billion dollars

106
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,410
in sales just of agricultural sales from

107
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,599
the group of counties that we were

108
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,520
working with in our focus groups so in

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,660
the end we're just in a few counties

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,539
that we're talking about it was about

111
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,280
seven billion dollars generated that

112
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,560
potentially could be lost that's not

113
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,629
actual losses that's just potential if

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,110
we had a total washout like schoharie

115
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,120
Valley

116
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,280
so it's just trying to get an idea of

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,290
because some of the discussion is well

118
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,299
why are we even considering this is this

119
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,550
that big a deal well from an economic

120
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,620
standpoint in those communities it's a

121
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,860
really big deal plus we included some

122
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,840
job jobs in those particular areas and

123
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,400
earnings from those particular jobs but

124
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,829
the sales are really what kind of drive

125
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,849
the point home so that's potential

126
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:58,379
impact if we totally wiped out the

127
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,780
sections we were talking about the focus

128
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,449
group regions so this slide attaches

129
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,699
directly to the colored counties they

130
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,300
are totals just of the colored counties

131
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,579
I I just did it had Jim run that data so

132
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,500
we can compare within the different

133
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,120
focus groups I wanted to see if there

134
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,759
was any huge difference from the western

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,980
New York group to the ultra green

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,480
Columbia County group and we really

137
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,850
didn't find they were very similar

138
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,860
across those economic impacts which is

139
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,920
interesting given the diversity of our

140
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,020
New York State this slide we in bounced

141
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,420
back to but this is the focus group that

142
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,879
we started working with when I get into

143
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:39,240
the actual methodology will refer back

144
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,069
to that slide because each color code is

145
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,710
a group that we pulled together for

146
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:46,019
focus groups to talk to producers I get

147
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,359
there in just a minute the overall goals

148
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,939
of the project literally had we had

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,009
three particular areas of interest we're

150
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:57,269
trying to outline economic impacts and

151
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:59,279
define where producers were in terms of

152
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,680
extreme weather it was always it was a

153
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,449
good diverse discussion to have we've

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,220
talked the north country folks they're

155
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,139
already familiar with snow snow wasn't a

156
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,790
huge issue they automatically reverted

157
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,139
back to the ice storm which was way

158
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,610
outside of our school but there are

159
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,409
still stars in there that that's what

160
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,879
they needed to talk about it was the one

161
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,800
time where they were totally caught off

162
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,930
guard and they learned quite a bit from

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,150
being out of power for extended period

164
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,939
of time we started talking to scary and

165
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,859
scarier obviously was the the severe

166
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,769
flooding we started talking to Buffalo

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,060
region they were they weren't quite as

168
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,199
concerned they got through the snow

169
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,730
event where there was some issue other

170
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,949
issues that they had they were really

171
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,200
where the frost frost event started to

172
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,819
become very crisp in their minds when

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,339
they started talking about trying to

174
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,918
figure out how to recover and plan a

175
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,089
in that extreme weather case we also are

176
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,519
looking at strengths and weaknesses of

177
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:49,259
emergency response systems is the

178
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,329
commute the communication system that we

179
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,899
already have in place effective or not

180
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:56,579
effective as seen from the producers as

181
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,779
well as our non producer group so we had

182
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,579
two different groups that I'll show in

183
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,918
our methods courses or methods

184
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,379
discussion and then really trying to

185
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,029
assess farmers concern regarding severe

186
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,860
weather events a disaster planning are

187
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,750
they doing anything for planning are

188
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,840
they worried about severe weather how

189
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,300
does this topic impact them and are they

190
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,478
considering that as we move forward so

191
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,189
those three goals with over overarching

192
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,930
perspective of the project had six

193
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,449
different research questions which will

194
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,079
pop up again that really we tried to

195
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:30,089
dress those specific goals on preventive

196
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,389
steps that were already in place

197
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:36,629
additional privet what didn't we have in

198
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,079
terms of preventive steps for the event

199
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:42,449
that they were focusing on what factors

200
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,069
impacted decisions we had one farmer

201
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,228
that was adding it wasn't weather

202
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:48,089
related but he was now investing 20,000

203
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:49,620
for deer fence because he'd made a

204
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,239
decision that it was finally time to

205
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,728
invest that money he was losing too much

206
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,280
from deer impact which wasn't

207
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:57,689
weather-related specifically hello in

208
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,848
the last couple winters we start talking

209
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:02,399
about deer pressure because of the heavy

210
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:03,978
snow load the deer pressure was directed

211
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,509
towards them because it was food source

212
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:10,469
so we factors then we ended up with

213
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:13,409
factors impacting those responses the

214
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,820
note basically we've got along with the

215
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,889
producers we're also looking at

216
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,079
extension educators we're looking at

217
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,720
researchers and we're looking at state

218
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:27,060
agencies agata markets Red Cross Dec

219
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,479
what were their interests and what were

220
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,070
their thoughts compared to the producers

221
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,689
so we've got those two non producer

222
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,510
groups and producer groups that were a

223
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,680
subset and also part of our focus group

224
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,689
that I'll get through in just a second

225
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,259
what new capacity is needed to mitigate

226
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,029
so what do we have to add to this and do

227
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,669
we have a capacity already in our land

228
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:51,750
grant system extension the research to

229
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:53,370
respond to weather-related crises or are

230
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,549
there areas that we need to develop so

231
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,220
we're really looking for where

232
00:08:54,549 --> 00:09:00,458
are we at what can we move forward to

233
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,320
was very exploratory in nature a last

234
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,849
one how do we evaluate our response to

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
disaster and assess the strength of

236
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,250
networks used to coordinate efforts that

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,230
one was a true it was a great idea to

238
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,149
have that on the list we got very little

239
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,220
feedback from that in our focus groups

240
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,259
that one basically went unanswered

241
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,009
because we couldn't rather the data was

242
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:24,009
just not developed in the way we

243
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:26,350
presented our interview formats methods

244
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,299
really we've got six regions identified

245
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,940
which was the colored map that I showed

246
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:32,289
a little earlier we've got producers in

247
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,600
each of those areas the producers were

248
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:36,009
invited by any means we could I think

249
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,820
Trevor and I both thought we were going

250
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:42,490
to be in it made good sense we were

251
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,140
providing them a stipend to pay for

252
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,419
their time we're providing them lunch

253
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:50,049
and we're trying to do it off harvest

254
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,458
times and we still struggled in some

255
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,349
case some counties are really really

256
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,729
engaged but we weren't getting the

257
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,110
participation that we wanted we worked

258
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,690
farther out into our network of

259
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,459
extension and Farm Bureau to populate

260
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,260
the focus groups we did get very

261
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,899
interested participants but we were a

262
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,569
little thinner than we thought in total

263
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,309
numbers and we really tried to address

264
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,810
that as we move forward and and we're

265
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:15,639
consistently afforded in our efforts to

266
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,949
double the size of our focus groups but

267
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,208
we're basically at six or eight

268
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,220
participants per focus group which

269
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,349
worked well for in-depth discussion I

270
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,930
would have liked to had a second focus

271
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,629
group in each region and we were unable

272
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,578
to do that beyond the producers we did

273
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,980
pull in a state agency all of groups

274
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:34,958
listed came together in Albany for a

275
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,579
focus group to get their perspective we

276
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,698
pulled in two different extension

277
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:41,319
educators groups one of the western part

278
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:44,289
of the state one in hudson valley as

279
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,959
well as some local participants in the

280
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:49,328
focus groups that we had in our producer

281
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,448
sections we did have one it syracuse

282
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:53,859
with FSA representatives as one because

283
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:56,500
they're a direct link up to the federal

284
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,480
level tried to have some other producers

285
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,490
coming on that one and it ended up being

286
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,860
just the FSA group very intriguing

287
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,870
discussion points when we started

288
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,190
talking from FSA and their connection to

289
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,259
the feds in the states

290
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,550
compared to our other ones script and

291
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,080
the questions were developed one for

292
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,929
producers we slightly modified it for

293
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,610
non producers both were approaching the

294
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:17,620
six research questions and developing

295
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,990
directly from those all meetings were

296
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,060
actually recorded and transcribed and we

297
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,190
used macs QD a software for coding

298
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,349
analysis but our analysis took two

299
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,420
different paths we've got one that's

300
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,550
really using the coding system using

301
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,069
Mac's kewda we've got some results based

302
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:35,769
on that we then actually took a little

303
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,810
more of a s it was a high-energy

304
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,179
approach where Trevor and I basically

305
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,279
went back through our transcripts as we

306
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:46,509
were coding and then started to break

307
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:48,220
out into charts the differences across

308
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,929
all those research groups trying to get

309
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,519
a little deeper than just the coding

310
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:53,949
because we were finding the coding was

311
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,539
giving us some raw results we needed to

312
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,910
find some actual specifics down

313
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,250
underneath so we did another layer that

314
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:02,350
we'll see here shortly when we start

315
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,419
talking about results we break out the

316
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,620
coating the nice thing is it kind of

317
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,870
hits you with a broad spectrum

318
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,220
discussion points of what we found right

319
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,720
away right off the bat 137 citations for

320
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,370
resource demand and influence the

321
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,710
producers this is from the producers

322
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,000
really needed the thing they were

323
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,440
looking for is continued development of

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,929
opportunities for developed continued

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,480
resource development and how do we

326
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:30,069
connect to those resources and it was

327
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,159
across the spectrum because we did have

328
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,900
each focus group had different target

329
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,360
points one was the north country or they

330
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,759
were talking ice and transportation to

331
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,320
foodstuffs if the roads are shut down

332
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,970
how are we going to get through our

333
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,610
product to the market and how do we get

334
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,410
food up into the region if we don't have

335
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,060
that food available where we start

336
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:50,319
talking in western New York they weren't

337
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,259
quite as worried about that they were

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,339
much more worried about simply clearing

339
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,809
the snow out of the way and then

340
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,910
worrying about water we had some water

341
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:00,699
discussions out that way so it really

342
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,199
was very much independent of their focus

343
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,839
groups which you would mix which makes

344
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,390
intuitive sense but they all did focus

345
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,920
for 137 references on resources the

346
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:10,809
other one that was very similar in

347
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,449
height as emergency communication and

348
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,489
that didn't distinguish positive and

349
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,110
negative it just noted in the coding

350
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,600
that it was related to emergency

351
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,879
communique

352
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,040
the good news of this discussion was

353
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,528
they were very happy with the emergency

354
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,750
communication system as a general feel

355
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:28,850
from the state level down to the county

356
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,730
level that commits we were were at first

357
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,399
the one of the driving forces for this

358
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,379
study is was there a connection were the

359
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
producers feeling well connected to the

360
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:40,970
emergency systems when something happens

361
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,549
and across all the focus groups they

362
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,230
were actually quite positive with their

363
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:47,479
County systems and their connections to

364
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,199
Agra markets Agra markets has I mean

365
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,089
it's one woman is basically runs that

366
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,039
whole emergency management system they

367
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,750
all knew her and she's very well

368
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,939
connected to all the counties it was

369
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,559
very encouraging to hear that at the

370
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,600
same time we'd have a discussion on the

371
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,399
negative side the local folks weren't

372
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,199
talking to the counties so the villages

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,669
were disconnected with the counties so

374
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,828
in some cases there was a breakdown of

375
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,679
communication there there were some

376
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:14,328
counties that had some variability of

377
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,129
breakdown from the pru sure side to the

378
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:18,169
emergency response side there was

379
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,970
variability in there but across the

380
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:21,889
board they were very positive they also

381
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,300
saw extension I think it'll show up in

382
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:27,829
another one extension soil and water and

383
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,109
and their emergency response teams were

384
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:32,328
very active in making sure that the AG

385
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,180
community was brought into the fold when

386
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:37,969
a disaster hit the Extension Service was

387
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:40,219
rough was resource site in 62 times in

388
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,439
our discussion as well that was part of

389
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,990
a discussion to see how they were

390
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,399
fitting into the county level if you're

391
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,419
familiar with the extension system it is

392
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,639
the associate associations some counties

393
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:54,649
have very limited associations based on

394
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,680
budgetary constraints and some and some

395
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:00,769
historical resource points and there we

396
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,088
saw that variation but overall across

397
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,409
the focus groups who are working with

398
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,180
their very positive about their

399
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:07,219
extension systems if the extension

400
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:09,349
educators weren't there the soil and

401
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,629
water folks picked that up the recovery

402
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,810
issues weren't quite as strong as the as

403
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:16,338
the top three but we're still they were

404
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:17,838
that was basically talking about okay

405
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:19,399
well we're really worried about is the

406
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,350
aftermath how do we pick up the pieces

407
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,938
and keep moving forward this is where

408
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,519
crop insurance starts popping up as a

409
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:29,269
reference point which will we'll see in

410
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,310
a specific site we were talking about

411
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,600
popular resources into recovery do we

412
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:35,689
have generators for a long enough period

413
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,889
of time do we have the planning in place

414
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,470
that we can actually get to the

415
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,870
resources and establish recovery so

416
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,230
those are just the the key results from

417
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,700
the coding breakout but as I talk Trevor

418
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,460
and I got talking and wanted to go a

419
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,370
little more in depth to try to connect

420
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,560
those core really broad stroke pieces to

421
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,600
some inches specific details further

422
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,639
analysis just some examples that pop up

423
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,800
under resources the big one that

424
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,960
hammered basically across all counties

425
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,359
we've already if you're if you've

426
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,210
listened to NPR it's one of governor

427
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,710
Governor Cuomo's points already internet

428
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,540
access and cell phone coverage is very

429
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,519
weak in some of our areas we get

430
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:15,110
producers where it's not available

431
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,000
you've been on a good day the loan in

432
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,470
the disaster now a lot of the

433
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,659
communication systems are starting to

434
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,399
expect us to have cell phones and

435
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,809
internet connection well we've got parts

436
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,449
in our counties that don't have that

437
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:29,029
even on a good day it's extremely slow

438
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,250
that's becoming an issue that was very

439
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,929
vocalized there like we need to fix that

440
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,090
first and then we can build up from

441
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,129
there North Country was talking about

442
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,720
generators they basically already solved

443
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,250
that problem but it was it seemed to be

444
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,050
their key point that was in the back of

445
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,100
their minds the other operations i

446
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:45,740
mentioned transportation and

447
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,629
infrastructure we're really they said

448
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,789
yeah that's fine for the dairies but the

449
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:51,980
non dairies were really more worried

450
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:54,139
more about getting produce or product

451
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,370
out from their farms or into the

452
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,490
community to make sure the communities

453
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,299
had resources just to not stress because

454
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,590
of lack of food and basic supplies

455
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,720
emergency communication related topics

456
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,779
as i mentioned the counting state were

457
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,190
really sets seen as satisfactory the

458
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,539
local level had an awful lot of

459
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,130
variability depending on whether they

460
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,750
thought to eat rate read their emails

461
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,050
and were they engaged in the practices

462
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,490
for emergency response the federal level

463
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,319
was i was hoping to have better

464
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,900
connection to the federal level and even

465
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,179
the state level they didn't have a good

466
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,190
clear vision of the connection back up

467
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,920
to FEMA and whenever you talked about

468
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,289
FEMA that that fizzled out really really

469
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,300
fast there was not as much discussion

470
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,490
about that federal connection even from

471
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:39,409
the state level as I expected the state

472
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,269
is very organized and has a lot of plans

473
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,920
in place the federal level when we

474
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,529
connect up to that fed level it

475
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,230
go a lot of it goes through FSA and the

476
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:50,029
FSA discussion was there's some internal

477
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,769
communication issues so the federal

478
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,329
level we've got more work to do that one

479
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:58,279
basically didn't have a data we wanted

480
00:17:53,329 --> 00:18:01,899
it to pull together oh yes thank you FSA

481
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:04,369
is Farm Service Agency very involved in

482
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,850
providing resources from the federal

483
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:09,799
level both to farms that meet specific

484
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:11,899
qualifications they are also the Farm

485
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,200
Service Agency is the primary agency

486
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,710
that that will do a decide on a federal

487
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,779
declaration of disaster it funnels

488
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,090
through their agency for whatever reason

489
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,440
when the state starts looking at the

490
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,119
point where it's so bad that they've got

491
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,460
to go at the federal level for disaster

492
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,169
which opens up federal aid back to the

493
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,930
state so that farm service agency is a

494
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,509
conduit for that but it's primarily seen

495
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,670
as a lending resource for farmers that

496
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:39,319
meet those requirements they set for

497
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,259
federal aid thank you done for

498
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,849
clarifying that and as I talked about it

499
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,710
at the Extension Service and so on water

500
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,629
districts are very involved in each of

501
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,130
the regions it's kind of what we

502
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,440
expected that but there was some

503
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,880
discussion of how broadly that's going

504
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,309
to show up and both of them were very

505
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,420
strongly reported the other thing I'm

506
00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:01,639
going to do my watch my time I truncated

507
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,870
these these are splitting the other

508
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,180
directions so we've got a producer

509
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:07,399
response on the lesson on producers on

510
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,560
the right these are related to each

511
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,660
number is one of the six research

512
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,319
questions that we focused on effective

513
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,029
preventive steps element that popped up

514
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:20,809
here and didn't show up on the coating

515
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:22,549
the use of pictures and internet on

516
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,399
phones and internet to send information

517
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:29,029
right away Eden uses this already they

518
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,298
start doing what's the term for trevor's

519
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,038
we're doing

520
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:35,888
crowdsourcing they're doing

521
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,200
crowdsourcing to map their data as the

522
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:40,388
event hits the educators are sending in

523
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,489
information off their phones right away

524
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,168
so in a very short period of time in the

525
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,669
middle of the crisis they can start to

526
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,619
populate where the issues are happening

527
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:51,759
it's especially when we start talking to

528
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:53,259
Eden about we had a hail event in Homer

529
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,210
that I don't think anybody else in

530
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:57,278
cortland Tompkins County had I've got 10

531
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,399
or 15 houses that are replacing their

532
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:01,868
entire siding and roofing through

533
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:05,498
insurance because they had hail damage

534
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,759
in this 15 10 acre plot I don't know is

535
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:08,019
like when I talk to the growers that

536
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,970
they didn't see any damage because it

537
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,608
was mostly Hey but those types of things

538
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,649
are being identified through this use of

539
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:16,658
crowdsourcing that was one effective

540
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,969
preventive step additional preventive

541
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:22,480
step economic marketing analysis some

542
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:25,509
room for improved ideas and some tools

543
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,339
so that they can start to identify how

544
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,919
we make a change what do we do for as

545
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:31,868
part of the plan what's the cost if we

546
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,850
don't choose to do that if we say okay I

547
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:37,028
want to invest in one thing we talked

548
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:40,538
about was water as a big topic do we not

549
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:43,269
only flooding but also water attention

550
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:45,608
should we be paying attention to storing

551
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:47,409
more of the water that we have so that

552
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:49,329
we if we're going to carry through times

553
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,129
like our August was really really dry

554
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:52,388
not all farms or set up for irrigation

555
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:54,488
and don't have the water resources

556
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:55,959
should we be leaning that way that was a

557
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,369
discussion that came up in our summit

558
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,858
which I'll get to in a minute so some

559
00:20:57,368 --> 00:21:01,089
more thought process of tools the

560
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,858
producers can use because they're

561
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,658
starting to think about these issues but

562
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:05,829
non producers really we're also

563
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,289
confident the experiment the

564
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:11,199
communication they did see some issues

565
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:13,028
with soil erosion after storm and trying

566
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,489
to improve exposure for New York Eden

567
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:18,460
New York Eden is the extension disaster

568
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:20,739
education network based in natural

569
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,239
resources here on campus and they are

570
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,399
starting to they've got really great

571
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,749
resources but there was a discussion of

572
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:27,878
trying to make sure they're they're

573
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:30,730
getting their message out more to a

574
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:33,308
broader population so that it's there

575
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,679
what needs to grow the third and fourth

576
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:37,358
ones factors impacting economic

577
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,669
decisions again they wanted a little

578
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:42,339
more some more tools to use for

579
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,880
cost-benefit analysis as they do work on

580
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:47,859
their plan

581
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,630
a very responsive very response in

582
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:51,609
davila the responses were very

583
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,940
individualized depending on what focus

584
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:56,829
group you were working with as a whole

585
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,900
clear communication from connie a state

586
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:01,960
level i already hit that on the non

587
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,610
producer side the one thing we talked

588
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,490
about was economics to design we were

589
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:08,949
talking about the Buffalo snowstorm were

590
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,829
a lot of barns that collapsed and just

591
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,230
having some numbers and some tools too

592
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:16,480
because you can the one situation we

593
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,430
also talked about was a greenhouse an

594
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,799
entire business greenhouse business that

595
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,500
was totally flattened and you can only

596
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,029
reinforce and / build greenhouses so far

597
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,269
because before they become cost

598
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:29,710
prohibitive have that discussion and to

599
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,420
start to look at some economics they

600
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,880
used to do that back when this was AG

601
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,670
engineering we had all sorts of tables

602
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,590
for some of that type of resource I'm

603
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,210
not we hadn't seen that at the state

604
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:42,699
level of the agencies they hadn't seen

605
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,920
new data relative to snow loads and

606
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,250
thought that was interesting to to

607
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,870
consider as an option and then one thing

608
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,309
they brought up was once you go through

609
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,869
the flood or you go through the

610
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,240
snowstorm you're better prepared next

611
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:57,159
time which is totally intuitive but they

612
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,269
brought to at the point of okay when we

613
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,730
start working the producers that have

614
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,950
done this they're a lot more compared

615
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,390
the next time we just have to get their

616
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,610
neighbors to learn you know if

617
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,080
neighboring counties didn't go through

618
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,179
the Schoharie flawed learn from what

619
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:14,559
they're doing and try to grow before it

620
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,789
hits them personally last two we already

621
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,940
talked about internet and cell phone

622
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,369
coverage for response in terms of new

623
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,009
capacities there was a mention of GPS

624
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,769
locations available which county should

625
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:29,379
already have but we were unsure of the

626
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:32,289
uniformity of across the county's areas

627
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,800
for further research one area was and

628
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:38,940
this was the area for far for local for

629
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:41,349
future resource really emphasized

630
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,789
small-scale agriculture that was also

631
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:44,529
nature of the focus groups that we had

632
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,549
our Batavia group was probably the only

633
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,129
one that I can think of that we had

634
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,349
large operators there just by nature we

635
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,690
were in scary scary had a couple to

636
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:55,209
that's true so we had large operators

637
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,220
and scary and large in Batavia but the

638
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,690
other ones were

639
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,700
Merrilee just self selected to be

640
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,100
smaller operators the larger ones were

641
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,679
pointedly invited but chose not to

642
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,839
participate so it's one of the devices

643
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,090
and issues we have with the focus group

644
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,250
format but they like a little more

645
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,079
resources put into extension which were

646
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,240
already trying to do from Cornell

647
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,449
University doing our active research out

648
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,359
to the extension office's I think that

649
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,580
pathway could be strengthened and that's

650
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,500
one of the points they bring up there

651
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:28,019
also they brought up FSA does a similar

652
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,700
course thing where they've got data from

653
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,440
their agents and that they didn't

654
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,940
realize Eden was using it and vice versa

655
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,279
it'd be really great if they could just

656
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,710
communicate a little bit and and come so

657
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,450
they had a really strong resource base

658
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,659
I'm trying to make those connections

659
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,940
because the two groups had not actually

660
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,440
sat down and had a discussion about how

661
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,659
each of their crowdsourcing worked and

662
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,788
then one element we also talked about

663
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,289
from the state agency wise what happens

664
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:54,119
if the cell phone system is down in

665
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:56,940
Internet's down do we have a mechanism

666
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,199
in place when it gets bad enough where

667
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,419
the cell towers are out and the

668
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,340
Internet's down because the

669
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,710
infrastructure is overflowed so it looks

670
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:06,449
similar to what happened in Sandy that

671
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,620
hasn't been answered or addressed some

672
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,538
of the cell phone towers now have

673
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,798
generators which will help but that was

674
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,109
one of those that everybody's like oh

675
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,250
yeah okay we don't want to go there so

676
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:16,259
we need to start having that discussion

677
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:20,579
of what's the next step to make sure our

678
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:23,548
infrastructure is stabilized concept map

679
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,119
we also took the overall coding laid out

680
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:28,349
and tried to come up with a flowchart

681
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,928
just to conceptualize what we're talking

682
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,639
about really the trigger is a severe

683
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,288
weather event the interesting thing we

684
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,470
found is basically all producers agreed

685
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:38,700
there either a low-end them end of

686
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,829
emergency planning or moderate planning

687
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,048
nobody honestly said they were an

688
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:45,509
outstanding planning so I left damage in

689
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:47,548
there instead of high-level planning so

690
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:49,400
after the event if we go through low

691
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:52,619
level of plan that's going to cause some

692
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,240
adaptation by force because they weren't

693
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,219
prepared for it something has happened

694
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,779
and they've got to catch back up if they

695
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,120
had a moderate level of plan they're

696
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,379
going to have to show some resiliency so

697
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,689
it's not going to affect them quite as

698
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,480
much that'll trigger down into that

699
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,769
affects all of our producers but also

700
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,930
brings the government levels in the

701
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:11,599
government meaning

702
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,400
local and county levels we start feeding

703
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,169
in information the resources from the AG

704
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,840
service agencies into the producers and

705
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,460
that producer can start working with the

706
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,019
resources that they have or the

707
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,539
resources that they need to track down

708
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:26,509
as well as trying to refine the

709
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:28,730
emergency planning resources are feeding

710
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:31,759
up into communications resources and

711
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,349
planning as a thought process to realize

712
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,690
that those producers have to engage with

713
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:37,429
all three of those towards the idea of

714
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,720
bringing the resources in and this is

715
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,789
probably the second iteration maybe

716
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,009
third iteration of the model we keep

717
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:45,109
keep trying to refine how to best

718
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:47,660
present the the flow because it's not

719
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:51,229
exactly linear simply because it's

720
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:53,390
that's the nature of the seer weather

721
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,299
process there are a couple models that I

722
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,370
could pull in our in my other resource

723
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,169
or the next phase of this and research

724
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,819
I'm doing in my dissertation I've got a

725
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,009
different set of models that probably we

726
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,119
should we compared with this we weren't

727
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,670
trying to do that we're just trying to

728
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,459
explain what happened in the information

729
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:14,779
we collected we did have a couple

730
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:17,539
community values just statements that

731
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,950
revered pulled out that really kind of

732
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,930
said what they were thinking from

733
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,400
producers perspective you know in my

734
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,960
community we've got a farming attitude

735
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,070
everybody cares about his neighbor and

736
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,870
that's worth more than anything else

737
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,429
there's no government program that can

738
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,229
replace that they're going to make sure

739
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,789
and and these are farmers basically

740
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,779
saying okay I'm going to be a farmer

741
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,920
we're going to make sure this we're

742
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:35,629
going to solve the problem one where the

743
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,660
other they aren't actively going out

744
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:40,280
looking for resources from the community

745
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,519
they like to have that infrastructure

746
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,619
there but they're also in some cases the

747
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,599
first ones length down at the bottom I

748
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:48,949
think the farmer just as all we have the

749
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,689
ability to deal we're the ones that are

750
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,090
going to clean up at if there's a major

751
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,860
weather event or make the repairs or

752
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,869
replant or rebuild with the help of the

753
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:58,490
insurance company they'll step in and

754
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:00,019
make sure the resources are provided I

755
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,750
know one of the growers I talked to you

756
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:04,910
know worst case the worst case scenario

757
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,960
he takes the tractor down the road opens

758
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,340
the road up because the plows haven't

759
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,019
gotten that far the milk truck can get

760
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,669
through that brings up an interesting

761
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,619
discussion of liability which we started

762
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,660
to discuss the but at the end of the day

763
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:18,349
they're going to solve the problem and

764
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,060
so that came through and quite regularly

765
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,069
is yes the communication system is

766
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,639
pretty solid but we also feel if we've

767
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:24,740
got a good

768
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,290
moderate level of planning we can

769
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,200
weather most of the incidents I don't

770
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,399
i'm not sure i think that was also the

771
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,279
opinion of schoharie county until they

772
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,960
got hit with a 500 year flood level that

773
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,859
they weren't expecting and they had to

774
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,150
rethink their Ledet level of preparation

775
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:45,529
we then as a final piece pulled together

776
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,900
would we have 50 about 50 or 60

777
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,819
individuals in Geneva for a resiliency

778
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,830
summit as part of the grant that was the

779
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,779
next stage where broadens researchers a

780
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:56,449
different set of educators a couple

781
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:57,710
producers and key pieces surface here

782
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,049
that we didn't see in our focus groups

783
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,970
the huge the two big ones were water

784
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,559
retention and erosion issues especially

785
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,259
retention should we be paying attention

786
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,779
to keeping the water on site instead of

787
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:11,119
letting it go down the rivers or do that

788
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,789
as some mitigation for flooding in a

789
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,739
broader perspective soil quality and

790
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,970
stabilization Wade one producer was

791
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,829
adamant that that should have been and

792
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,600
it is important i think we were freezing

793
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:22,220
it such that that was an understanding

794
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,889
but should we be paying attention to

795
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,279
make sure that this doesn't infringe on

796
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,710
our soil quality economic incentives how

797
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,839
do we get the producers to engage in

798
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,460
emergency planning the smaller guys

799
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,379
don't have the time and don't feel they

800
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,970
have the money the larger operators all

801
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,590
have some degree of emergency planning

802
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,140
built into k foes and their nutrient

803
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,669
plans are they actually implementing the

804
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,410
process a lot of times it'll sit on the

805
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,000
shelf how do we encourage them to

806
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,610
actually think of this as part of the

807
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,650
planning the AG businesses are not

808
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:53,779
always connected to the County EMS

809
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,150
system emergency management system so

810
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:57,829
the businesses are quite often are the

811
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,230
agricultural businesses sometimes are

812
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:02,899
separated out and are not is tightly now

813
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,210
aware we did talk about crop insurance

814
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,190
that popped up quite a bit with

815
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,769
everybody agreed it's an important tool

816
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,690
but it has some flaws in terms of being

817
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:14,629
designed for Midwest where we struggle

818
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:17,299
to adapt it overall County Planning was

819
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:20,800
also seen as strong but there were some

820
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:23,269
communication gaps next steps from that

821
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,309
we're basically doing a summary report

822
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:28,400
but from the summit we've actually got

823
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,559
Agra markets connect connected with

824
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,540
Trevor and I and we're working on a next

825
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,490
step they've got they'd like to take

826
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,700
another step forward we haven't

827
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,380
discussed what that was but

828
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
he's excited to meet with with me in

829
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,730
November to figure out how we move

830
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,590
forward along with Keith out of Eden

831
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:46,710
trevor is doing a perception of climate

832
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:48,869
change produce from the producers so

833
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,870
we're trying to go in that direction I'm

834
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:54,298
actually taking a dissertation off of

835
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:56,668
this base grant looking specifically at

836
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,798
at the county level there's a local

837
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:01,440
emergency planning committee mandated by

838
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,970
the state so every state has one or

839
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,429
every county has one but I'm also

840
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,990
finding in talking to a couple of them

841
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:08,639
there's an interesting amount of free of

842
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,470
variability in terms of how useful there

843
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,509
that's where the agricultural folks

844
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,399
should have connections to the emergency

845
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:16,470
response it's not happening in all the

846
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,178
counties so the next step is to figure

847
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,250
out why that's not happening even though

848
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,860
it's mandated by the state in some cases

849
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,690
the connections are not being made in

850
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:28,918
some counties they're being very well

851
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,240
made and it's not as much of an issue so

852
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,259
those are the three different directions

853
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,788
we're going to go right out of the

854
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,788
report we've also we're going to develop

855
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:37,558
fat sheets and tease out the data into

856
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:39,388
some more specific details we can send

857
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:40,798
back to our extension agents so they've

858
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,538
got a growth point there was a lot of

859
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,548
interest in the summit to just summarize

860
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:47,069
where this was as a launching point for

861
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:49,220
there's also money coming through to

862
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:52,528
soil and water agencies for more

863
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,778
specific water mitigation manure storage

864
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:56,819
cover mitigation and there was a third

865
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:58,200
one what have been related to soil that

866
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:02,490
they're getting ready to roll out as

867
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,259
well so as an exploratory project that

868
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:07,259
seemed to develop the interest in the

869
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,849
and start to answer some of the missing

870
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,190
information pieces that we couldn't find

871
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:12,480
in the literature all right quick any

872
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,788
questions on that then I'm going to

873
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,899
switch to my AG education piece so this

874
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:17,898
is phase one yes

875
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:33,730
11 that we actually had in the

876
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:37,389
resiliency summit was there's salt which

877
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,339
is a community generated program in

878
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,520
schoharie county that's totally

879
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:44,439
community-funded they're actually

880
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,539
establishing resource networks and a

881
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,250
much tighter of understanding of the

882
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:50,500
resources that are available and the

883
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,569
planning that's necessary to meet that

884
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,720
500 year flood so they've they've been

885
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:58,929
around for fair enough well yeah three

886
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,420
years totally originally grant funded

887
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:04,090
and now they're established establishing

888
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,850
the resource and much more careful data

889
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:09,159
points so everybody in the community has

890
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:10,959
some access to what happens if this

891
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,759
develops and that was really a model we

892
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,440
had presented at the summit that I think

893
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,890
more counties where there's a high risk

894
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,170
factor could use to just establish they

895
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,360
have a couple people on staff and they

896
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,400
actively work with the community members

897
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,500
to make sure that level of emergency

898
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,269
planning is high because then you can

899
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,619
vary depending on what the producer

900
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:32,769
needs are and the community needs are

901
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:34,359
yeah read question any other questions

902
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,400
we can come back to these if you want

903
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,439
I'm going to keep going because I run it

904
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,410
worry about getting running out of time

905
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:46,259
so that was the research we've been

906
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:50,650
working on which side project my day job

907
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:52,779
AG education and sips the I'm associated

908
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,790
with the aggregate agricultural outreach

909
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:56,920
program you probably not see most of

910
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,629
these folks Katie works off the office

911
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,580
out of the office in the North Country

912
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,890
she's a director of New York Evan

913
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:05,799
classroom deals with K through 12

914
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:09,010
educators the AG literacy day where they

915
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:12,279
read a children's book that's factually

916
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:14,590
accurate for agriculture to remember how

917
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,019
many thousands of children each year

918
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,539
that's for one of her big projects

919
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:21,190
yesterday executive secretary currently

920
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:24,070
julia philosophy we just hired derek

921
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:28,510
hill Julie's going to minnesota manages

922
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:30,789
the FFA we've got 6,000 students in and

923
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,680
after AG programs across the state which

924
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:35,110
i'll show you a map of she manages those

925
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,639
two she's on campus Terry and sherry or

926
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,840
ones in cobleskill and one is in the

927
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,509
north country providing

928
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,150
recruitment specialists and also support

929
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,730
for agricultural education teachers that

930
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,670
community is part of who I am as I

931
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,780
assume the director responsibilities but

932
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,860
that'll be the team that I'm working

933
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:57,350
with Mikey job is really working in the

934
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,170
AG science realm I've got 23 AG science

935
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,929
advisees that really focus on the soils

936
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:06,530
crops horticulture and education

937
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:08,149
perspectives so I just kind of Shepherd

938
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,000
them through as undergraduates and make

939
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,470
sure they're focusing on whatever

940
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,329
perspective they have and and refine

941
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:18,079
their career choices as we go through

942
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:21,199
the education minor has about 75 each

943
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,049
each class under class group has about

944
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,719
75 participants continuing to grow a

945
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,730
little bit Brian Duff and I basically

946
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,349
are working with the rest of our faculty

947
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,030
there's education faculty and

948
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:37,159
developments ocean anthropology that

949
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,960
Shepherd the minor and maintain that the

950
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:40,699
other key piece the least to me the

951
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,139
exciting part is i teach the art of

952
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:45,289
teaching it's a large survey course

953
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:47,989
university-wide to about 300 students a

954
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:50,119
year every semester we run that and I've

955
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:53,059
got Trevor's in there now as my graduate

956
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,389
ta along with Emily Dickinson Dietrich

957
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,670
and we've had I think three different

958
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:59,809
years this is a third year running

959
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,519
graduate teaching opportunities for

960
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:04,070
horticulture students and it's been

961
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,099
outstanding each one Emily's got an

962
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,600
interest in public gardens and and some

963
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,960
art history background and it's been a

964
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:15,079
really strong connection grant thompson

965
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,820
last year was outstanding and really has

966
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,619
shown some growth growth as he prepares

967
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,120
for teaching in his professional career

968
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:24,469
so it's been a great opportunity to

969
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:26,299
present i also when I saw my other job I

970
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:30,619
guess it comes up in my next slide two

971
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:32,960
more slides i also am coordinating the

972
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,730
student teaching and agricultural

973
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,340
education project at ithaca college

974
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,159
cornell used to have AG education

975
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:45,320
masters degree master's program that's

976
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:48,409
that dissolved in 2013 due to funding

977
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,090
and political situations but at the same

978
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:52,548
time the Dean reached out and picked out

979
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,829
picked up if a colleges program

980
00:36:52,548 --> 00:36:57,079
and we've partnered with them and half

981
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:58,759
of what we do is is actually the whole

982
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,410
thing is really plant and animal based a

983
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,539
good half of what we do in Ag education

984
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:05,808
is plant-based the other half is going

985
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:07,729
to be animal science based I spent this

986
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:10,069
is actually sure of my greenhouse when I

987
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:11,659
taught in high school we're doing some

988
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:14,358
irrigation work and also trying to work

989
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:16,399
on some potting development and I've

990
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,018
also got good alignment with both

991
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,910
extension programs across the state and

992
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:21,558
the public garden Marcia Shein sheave

993
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,838
Lee and the projects between that and

994
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,979
plantations we have we're stronger

995
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,259
building stronger and stronger

996
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:28,848
connections across those opportunities I

997
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:31,219
also teach the extensions Corps

998
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,318
extension outreach an instruction course

999
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,059
that align much better with the public

1000
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,759
garden and extension perspective because

1001
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:40,819
it's not specific with high school a few

1002
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:43,159
details about the education piece all

1003
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:45,588
the blue actually all the colors the red

1004
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:47,868
colors are colleges all the other

1005
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:50,358
colleges or other all the other dots

1006
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,400
blue and green have some connection to a

1007
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,438
high school agricultural program in some

1008
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,079
cases their full fully fledged AG

1009
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:59,178
programs with a certified teacher in

1010
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,259
some cases they don't have a certified

1011
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,969
teacher but they're teaching in

1012
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:04,338
environmental science through a science

1013
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:05,929
teacher or they're teaching aquatics

1014
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:07,938
down on Long Island I've got a couple

1015
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:09,559
marine science programs they're nice

1016
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:11,899
certified AG teachers a certified

1017
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,119
biology but all these folks have and

1018
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,719
somehow engaged with our agricultural

1019
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,630
resource folks that in terms of specific

1020
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,818
AG we're talking about 250 teachers with

1021
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,039
four positions over right now that I

1022
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:27,858
can't fill so the growth is actually an

1023
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,799
upward swing that's where this comes in

1024
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:32,920
supply and demand nationally all the red

1025
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:35,809
states are in shortage for AG teachers

1026
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,869
again I'm drawing from animal science

1027
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:40,969
heavily muscled giant from AG science

1028
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,469
agricultural science majors to draw them

1029
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:45,079
into the master's program as one

1030
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:47,028
opportunity for the careers to teach at

1031
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,349
least I taught for 17 years then I

1032
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:51,018
transition to farm net and I'm

1033
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:52,640
transitioned here it's something that

1034
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:54,318
they at least keep in the back of their

1035
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,328
mind I've got one young man that

1036
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:58,849
teaching in high school he went through

1037
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:00,469
education got certified he's and case I

1038
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:03,619
each made a position for him he's

1039
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:05,809
training training people across the

1040
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:08,088
Midwest for whatever they wanted to

1041
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:11,569
pain but they hired him because of his

1042
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:13,278
educational and marketing skills so

1043
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:16,818
there's definitely a shortage across

1044
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:19,369
most parts of the country our pathway is

1045
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:20,719
connecting with Ithaca College we've got

1046
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,479
an articulation agreements so there's

1047
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,670
there's nine credits actually up to 12

1048
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:28,129
credits that can transfer across the two

1049
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,619
institutions will start up the first

1050
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:32,420
mate the first cohort this may i'll

1051
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,969
probably have six teachers that are in a

1052
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,009
13 month program that will be on campus

1053
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:38,778
for a couple of the classes and then

1054
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:42,318
I'll supervisor student teaching out

1055
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:43,789
into the workforce as well personal

1056
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:48,739
background which is a deeper connection

1057
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:50,269
to the agricultural roots I did Don

1058
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:53,028
mentioned my ostrich I raised ostrich

1059
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:54,409
for 10 years in western New York that's

1060
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,818
a different I got a different power

1061
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:57,768
point on that we can talk about that and

1062
00:39:55,818 --> 00:40:00,259
the markets basically dissolved so I've

1063
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:01,968
switched to heritage breed hogs this is

1064
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:04,099
one of my American guinea hogs my

1065
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:07,729
daughter the artist snapped that picture

1066
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:11,509
so I were working with American guinea

1067
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:12,889
hogs just as a hobby now did work

1068
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,298
professionally as a landscaper in

1069
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:16,400
blacksburg Wiles put myself through

1070
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:18,259
graduate school I actually taught

1071
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,889
horticulture and turf and golf course

1072
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:24,019
design for actually 15 years not 17 15

1073
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:27,170
years in western New York along with

1074
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:28,909
forestry and then dotted mentioned my BS

1075
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:34,130
here in Ag education of my masters at

1076
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:36,409
virginia tech questions Wow well first

1077
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,390
of all men you for being the first

1078
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:41,699
speaker

1079
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:41,699
come here who has actually finished

1080
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,119
figure we had to have some time for

1081
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:48,399
questions because this is kind of off

1082
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,699
the beaten track a question actually

1083
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,450
warp or Trevor possibly to what degree

1084
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:59,189
the duties of participants in your focus

1085
00:40:55,449 --> 00:41:02,589
groups made a tie-in between these

1086
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,340
individual extreme weather events and a

1087
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:08,289
broader subject of global climate change

1088
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,420
so we were we cut climate change out of

1089
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:12,579
our script we didn't our consider all

1090
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,230
about City color came up it wasn't an

1091
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:17,230
article kiss group but it's probably in

1092
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,240
around once they have POTUS in fifty

1093
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,860
percent just brought it up of their own

1094
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,479
volition II because we were we were

1095
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,390
actively told to not use the term

1096
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,769
climate change based on a punter so it

1097
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:30,509
came up fifty percent of the time

1098
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,509
organically as part of our discussion

1099
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:41,409
some questions thank you so much dad
