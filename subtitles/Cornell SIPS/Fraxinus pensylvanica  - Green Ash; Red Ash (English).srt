00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
&gt;&gt;Fraxinus pensylvanica is

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,810
a large tree with compound leaves.

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,919
It also has smooth buds,

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,050
it's opposite and the buds have

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,990
a large leaf scar underneath each bud.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,870
Unusually, the twig actually gets wider

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,359
as it becomes more terminal.

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,119
This is Fraxinus pensylvanica, green ash.
