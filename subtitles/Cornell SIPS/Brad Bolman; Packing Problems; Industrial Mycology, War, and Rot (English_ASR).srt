1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,839
University it's really delightful to be

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,719
here I'm very thankful to to Alex and to

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,839
Kathy for helping to bring me to

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:18,559
Ithaca and uh very much to Lou as well

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,079
who's somewhere in the back for helping

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,439
uh on all the logistical

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,278
Arrangements um it's a little it's fun

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,800
and also frightening to to talk about

10
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:27,599
these topics in front of a room full of

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,599
scientists which is not my typical

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,240
audience uh because you all will know

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,119
when I'm uh saying things that are

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,039
totally wrong the historians don't um

15
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,679
and so I hope you'll be kind in the Q&amp;A

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,558
if I've totally butchered something but

17
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,878
uh I think I have an interesting story

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,439
for you I hope you'll enjoy it I have to

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,039
apologize to anyone who's listening to

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,759
this on Zoom because the PowerPoint uh

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,920
looks pretty nice in person but will

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,399
look clunky on the internet so you have

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,239
my

24
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,320
apologies okay so let me begin with the

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,078
problem of rotten

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,920
shoes so the year is 1942

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,079
it is late August and the Australian and

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,599
American armed forces are fighting to

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,438
defend a strategically valuable point at

30
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,399
the South Eastern tip of Papua New

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,279
Guinea known as mil Bay which is roughly

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,880
there from a Japanese assault although

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,560
the Battle of mil Bay uh was a small

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,158
engagement it was important for a number

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,320
of reasons it was for instance the first

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,000
time in World War II that a Japanese

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,959
amphibious invasion was

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,959
defeated but it was also fought in a h

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,158
hot humid jungle environment with almost

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,879
continuous pouring Lane this photo gives

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
you a sense of the landscape and its

42
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,560
challenges and this is a field recording

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,280
from elsewhere in Tapo inini so what

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
you're hearing is the experience of

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,840
being in a a rain in the bundle

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,478
there so Australian forces who had been

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
in the region longer noticed that much

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,158
of their equipment was malfunctioning

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,159
mine detectors did not detect tank mines

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,600
radio sets went dead soldiers found that

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,200
they couldn't even see through their gun

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,438
sits because they were clogged by

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,560
mysterious forces boots and Tents fell

54
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,840
apart overnight in the hot and wet

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,598
environment a guide book published in

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,439
1943 by the Allied Forces explained

57
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,238
quote that pop New Guinea is a primitive

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,479
hard country and a new world to men from

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,080
overseas you go there to fight a

60
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,759
dangerous enemy the Japanese but they

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,200
are not the only enemy the country

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,000
itself will fight you you must be

63
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,639
forever on your guard against this

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
silent enemy your environment it is

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,479
Relentless if you relax it will get you

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
down and as evidence of what that meant

67
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,759
this is an ammunition magazine after one

68
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,199
week of exposure in New Guinea compared

69
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,598
with a factory Fresh Magazine uh

70
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,359
although this was not the first time

71
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,959
that militaries had fought in a humid

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,080
environment the scale and the intensity

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,800
of the conflict in the in the tropics uh

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
caused a previously invisible

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,680
environment to make itself felt very

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,199
forcibly on world militaries

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,799
technologically scientifically and

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,318
strategically molds in particular

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,239
microscopic life forms that most

80
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,238
soldiers had never even thought about

81
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,439
were coming out of the woods very

82
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,439
literally to sabotage the war

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,200
effort so today what I'm going to do is

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,599
Trace the development of the science of

85
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,759
in deterioration prevention which we can

86
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,438
think about as the effort to understand

87
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,039
how environments damage materials and

88
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:34,680
how it made our system of sort of global

89
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,400
fast-moving Goods possible I've already

90
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,840
told you about the problem of moldy

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
shoes I'm going to continue by giving

92
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,239
you background on my larger Book Project

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,080
and sort of giving some context for this

94
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,120
undertaking I'll Trace how the field was

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,560
transformed uh or I'll introduce you to

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,879
the field of industrial micology and

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,799
talk about how that was transformed by

98
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,120
the fighting in World War II and finally

99
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll end by showing how these Technical

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,280
and scientific advances from early

101
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,438
decades enabled the growth of rotten

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,560
capitalism you'll forgive the pun but an

103
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:09,318
economic system that is structured on an

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,920
ambivalent relationship with fungi both

105
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,000
Pro proactively utilizing microfungi to

106
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,079
produce products but also destroying

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,439
fungi to preserve a series of other

108
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,918
products so for the last few years I've

109
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,800
been working on a history of the

110
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,359
development of fungal science Alex very

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
kindly explained and I've been exploring

112
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
a number of connected disciplines so

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,800
taxonomic micology Medical micology

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,400
Plant Pathology industrial micology and

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,918
more and in the project I'm particularly

116
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,839
interested in thinking about how

117
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,918
previously ignored aspects of the

118
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,918
environment become knowable by

119
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,240
scientists and by Regular People and how

120
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,399
that knowledge propels novel forms of

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,360
utilization of those materials and

122
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,120
produces new Human Relationships so how

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,038
do we know that a mushroom is a fungus

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,399
rather than a plant which most people

125
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:59,719
throughout history did not think uh and

126
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,959
how does that change our Rel

127
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,440
relationship to that thing what does it

128
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,159
mean for how we interact with it I'm

129
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,160
calling the book Rotten Beauty to kind

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,759
of Index this ambivalent relationship

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,560
that people have with fungal things some

132
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,240
of them are lovely beautiful Etc some of

133
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,519
them are scary dangerous and need to be

134
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,918
destroyed So This research Builds on my

135
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,120
first book this is the Shameless

136
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,159
self-promotion moment uh which comes out

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,160
in May and there I provide a history of

138
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,039
the laboratory dog over the last two

139
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,199
centuries uh you might be wondering why

140
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,959
is someone who wrote a book about dogs

141
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,240
uh uh qualified or interested in writing

142
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,719
a book about mushrooms and one answer to

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,800
that question is my sort of repeated

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
interest in

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,520
Cornell uh I mentioned this in part

146
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,519
because an early section of that first

147
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,478
book talks about influential research on

148
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,519
Canine health and diseases that took

149
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,399
place not very far from we are now from

150
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,478
where we are now uh at the baker

151
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,560
Institute which was then known as the

152
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,800
research laboratory for the diseases of

153
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,160
dogs this facility opened in the 1950s

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,879
uh and you can see that if IA looked a

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
little bit different back then uh and

156
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,959
it's one of the many ways that my

157
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,079
historical interests have kind of

158
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,758
returned me to

159
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,758
Cornell and as a historian I'm kind of

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,360
interested in the knowledge that we have

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,080
about other kinds of organisms uh

162
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,280
efforts to make sense of dogs or pigs or

163
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,159
parrots or other kinds of living things

164
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,918
connect unexpected people across places

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,120
across disciplines across knowledge

166
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,719
communities and in the dog book I was

167
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,319
really interested in what is it like for

168
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,360
scientists and other people to an animal

169
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
that they identify with so they see

170
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,360
themselves in dogs they like dogs they

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
like being with dogs many of you

172
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,680
probably do as well the question is a

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
little bit different with a fungus that

174
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,079
many scientists who worked with them

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
don't really like them very much they're

176
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,680
kind of disgusting at times they're not

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
something that you want to have in your

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,160
house uh too much of perhaps uh and so

179
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,960
this changed the kinds of historical

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,280
questions that I was interested in in in

181
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,399
trying to understand how do we come to

182
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,399
deal with and understand alien or

183
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,399
invisible or micros opic organisms and

184
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,399
so as this sketch that I found in a

185
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,799
Dutch Museum helpfully demonstrates I

186
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,279
began to shift my focus from the dog at

187
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,120
the top of the tree to the mushrooms at

188
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,079
its bottom and I think with good reason

189
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,439
because today if you open newspapers

190
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,240
it's hard to avoid the sense that the

191
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,759
world needs fungi to save us from a host

192
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,199
of modern problems there is I think an

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,400
eagerness in the cultural Sphere for the

194
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,520
non-human power of mushrooms and other

195
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,598
fungal things to to save us from

196
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,918
human-made crises so in my project I'm

197
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,038
trying to bring together a number of

198
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,519
historical threads to explain how we got

199
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,639
to this point how did it make sense that

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,799
fungi could be a solution to Global

201
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,038
Climate problems and other

202
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,800
issues I'm not however the first person

203
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,519
to try to do this and uh I'm following

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
somewhat in the footsteps of Jeffrey

205
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,158
answorth the British myologist and

206
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,120
historian who attempted in three books

207
00:07:55,158 --> 00:08:00,399
published in the 1970s and 80s to try to

208
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,840
do something of a broad sweeping History

209
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:06,279
of mological Science I think the benefit

210
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,079
and the fault of ainsworth's work is

211
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,679
that he separated these topics into sort

212
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:14,000
of their distinct disciplinary areas but

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
in doing so I think he accepted the idea

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,918
that these are different undertakings

215
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,598
and I'm interested in trying to bring

216
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,038
some of these things more together and

217
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,680
tell a more comprehensive story about

218
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,560
the development of this knowledge

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,959
project so I'll give you just a few

220
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,478
overarching kind of threads and then

221
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,318
I'll get back to the the question of

222
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,838
rotten stuff

223
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,320
so part of what I'm interested in is

224
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,159
tracing the development of General

225
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
micology as it emerged out of Botany and

226
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,879
separated itself from conventional

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,120
medical knowledge in the late 19th

228
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,399
century I'm looking at tools of

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,399
visualization from watercolor and

230
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,759
microscopes to DNA sequencing and image

231
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,639
recognition algorithms to show how a

232
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,159
vision of micology or fungal biology as

233
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,799
a sort of worldwide project began to

234
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,879
take began to take over in the early

235
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,359
20th century I'll say a bit more about

236
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,039
this a little bit later I'm also

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,879
interested in tracing how medical

238
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,879
micology gradually separated itself from

239
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,278
other uh ways of knowing and engaging

240
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,519
with fungal things and how the people

241
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,720
who study fungal infections became sort

242
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,879
of caught at times between different

243
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,959
worlds between medical schools and

244
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,200
biological Laboratories and often

245
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,719
suffered the uh funding challenges of

246
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,399
both the historic marginalization of

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,440
medical micology I think is really

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,720
important because today we know that

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
that uh fungal diseases are of growing

250
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,160
prominence and importance at an

251
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,399
international scale so the World Health

252
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,039
Organization has said that the next

253
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,759
pandemics could be fungal in origin

254
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,679
climate change of course is increasing

255
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,399
this risk so I think it's important to

256
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,399
understand this history and understand

257
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,078
why we haven't done so much research in

258
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,600
that

259
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,399
area another uh area of the book that's

260
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,040
of course very relevant here is the

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,839
development of Plant Pathology there's a

262
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,000
major transformation at the start of the

263
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,839
20th century where suddenly universities

264
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,919
all around the world are opening

265
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,320
programs in Plant Pathology including

266
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:07,360
this one here Cornell uh and begin to

267
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,560
see the subject as essential for the

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,639
development of international agriculture

269
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,559
so how did that happen why why did that

270
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,078
happen and how did that influence our

271
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,559
sort of modern version of Agriculture

272
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,519
and those of you who know a lot about

273
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,359
rusts will maybe recognize this as part

274
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,919
of Elvin Stan's early Research into uh

275
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
wheat rust so those are a few of the

276
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,319
threads of the book I can talk more in

277
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,919
the Q&amp;A I didn't want to bore everyone

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,680
with too much sort of overview uh but

279
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,399
what I'm trying to argue is that uh

280
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,759
although often kind of ignored and

281
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,399
thought of as a subsidiary or

282
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,278
unimportant area research about fungal

283
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
things really transformed and shaped the

284
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:44,200
20th century in in very prominent ways

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,759
and I think I'm preaching to the choir

286
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,759
here but I think more people need to

287
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,319
think about the history of mological

288
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:54,240
Science and and understand its

289
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,760
importance all

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
right so to illustrate a bit of this

291
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,000
ambivalent relationship that people have

292
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,440
to fungi I want to talk a little bit

293
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,039
about the field of industrial micology

294
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,240
where it came from uh and you and uh and

295
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,559
and sort of show how this developed into

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,320
a much kind of broader and more nebulous

297
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,439
uh sort of study of environmental

298
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,639
deterioration in 1938 British myologist

299
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,680
George Smith published the first edition

300
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,919
of the introduction to uh industrial

301
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,799
micology and acquainted many people with

302
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,519
a new area of knowledge concerning

303
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,879
fungi as Smith explained in his preface

304
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,440
to the first edition

305
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,439
quote this book is intended to assist

306
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,360
those who are commencing the study of

307
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,320
molds rather than a fungi in general

308
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,680
there is already an extensive literature

309
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,120
of systematic micology Plant Pathology

310
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,799
and medical micology but there has been

311
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,600
up to the present no book in English

312
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,000
dealing particularly with the fungi

313
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,519
which are of importance in Industry so

314
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,120
as Smith made clear there was a great

315
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,278
amount of mological knowledge in

316
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,519
existence but biochemical knowledge of

317
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,120
molds was urgently needed so what had

318
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,039
changed to make that

319
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
necessary biochemist Harold rrick who is

320
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,759
today so little remembered that I

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,320
actually had to create his Wikipedia

322
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:12,159
page um explained that the two basic

323
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,519
challenges of industrial micology in a

324
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,360
forward to Smith's book so he said on

325
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,639
the one hand you have all these

326
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,680
industries involved in handling organic

327
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,159
materials including the food industry

328
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:26,120
the textile industry wood Etc and all of

329
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,439
these industries were losing extensive

330
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,639
supplies and products to the destructive

331
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,160
powers of fungi antifungal sprays and

332
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,919
other kinds of things were needed to

333
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,198
combat these

334
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,439
molds but then on the other hand

335
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:41,639
biochemists had recognized The Marvelous

336
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,880
powers and capacities of fungi for

337
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,639
producing useful Industrial Products so

338
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,278
many of you may know that prior to World

339
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,360
War I most of the world's citric acid

340
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,679
came from lemons and Sicily which are

341
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,480
shown here and they were used in the

342
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,278
production of things like sodas desserts

343
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,399
Etc but World War I cut America off from

344
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,799
citric acid so they had to find

345
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,519
artificial and synthetic ways to produce

346
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:07,958
citric acid without getting all of these

347
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,399
Italian lemons uh this was an important

348
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,159
development for a whole bunch of reasons

349
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,120
it's really bad for Sicily um but it it

350
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,319
introduced a lot of researchers like rri

351
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,519
to this idea that you could use small

352
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,320
fungal organisms and produce these kind

353
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,679
of fantastic and useful Industrial

354
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
Products rrick knew about all of this

355
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,278
firsthand because during the first world

356
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
war he had participated in secretive

357
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,679
research to use yeast to produce

358
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,919
glycerol which was a key chemical for

359
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,679
explosives his findings were utilized in

360
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,799
the war effort but they were also really

361
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,799
valuable for the British mining industry

362
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,519
in peace time so a lot of synthetic

363
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,000
explosives were produced for mining in

364
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
subsequent years rerk uh focused his

365
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,198
attention on assaying fungi for a whole

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,559
bunch of other useful industrial uh

367
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,679
purposes and in the 1920s he took up a

368
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,838
chair in Biochemistry in the London

369
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,439
School of hygiene and tropical medicine

370
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,279
where he appointed Smith the author of

371
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,680
the book his research

372
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,919
assistant rather than explosives though

373
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,559
Smith came to Industrial micology via

374
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,639
the clothing industry he began his

375
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,119
career as a chemist for the textile

376
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,560
manufacturer Borman and baron which is

377
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
the headquarters are very blurry they're

378
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,758
hard to see uh Borman and a number of

379
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,638
other companies at this time were

380
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,600
producing doties which is a sort of

381
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,360
white cotton fabric that was shipped to

382
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,399
British India to use for fat uh clothing

383
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,600
and a bunch of other uses during the

384
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,440
long Oceanic Transit however

385
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,399
however from England to India a lot of

386
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,880
these things miled they became sort of

387
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,799
destroyed by a fungal uh processes that

388
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,198
was then known as

389
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,719
tendering this was not a brand new

390
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,559
concern at this time period uh for

391
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,360
instance this print from the 18th

392
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,119
century Japanese artist katsuk kawash

393
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
shuno appears to depict women airing out

394
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,360
books to prevent mildew and insect

395
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,879
infestations uh According to curators

396
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,480
which kind of demonstrates that this

397
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,679
fight against spoilage was a very

398
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,879
long-standing one

399
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,838
but Smith's work showed how the British

400
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,600
Empire in this kind of continent

401
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,759
spanning uh scope made a lot of these

402
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,360
economic problems much more serious and

403
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,839
and requiring action although the exact

404
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,639
numbers are difficult to come by it's

405
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,519
clear that a huge number of cotton goods

406
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,159
were destroyed by milus uh during this

407
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,720
period in response the British cotton

408
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,480
manufacturer's research arm in

409
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Manchester known as the Shirley

410
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,319
Institute shown here uh invested

411
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,278
significant effort into understanding

412
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,399
how to to vent and Destroy these molds

413
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,838
at the time the most effective solution

414
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,240
was the application of zinc chloride

415
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,759
which protected clothes but you needed

416
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,440
to use a ton of it so it was really

417
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,278
expensive but around 1930 researchers at

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,639
the Shirley Institute had a breakthrough

419
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,639
with a new antifungal product known as

420
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,079
salic

421
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,360
salano uh because that was a mouthful

422
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:54,278
they called it Sheran for their

423
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,480
Institute for over a decade Sheran was

424
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,600
the single best way to prevent cotton

425
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,639
products from deteriorating over time in

426
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,079
warm moist environments and to prevent

427
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,919
their tendering and so building on their

428
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,879
work in the 1930s Smith was able to

429
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,799
identify a number of species of

430
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,480
aspergillis responsible for this mildew

431
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,318
and so here what you're seeing is the

432
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,519
the aspergillis organism inside the

433
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,719
fabric of the doti many of you may know

434
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,759
that they're called this because Pier

435
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,278
Antonio McKelly thought that under a

436
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,079
microscope the asper aspergilli looked a

437
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,958
lot like the uh sort of holy water

438
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,879
dispenser that he found in in the

439
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,078
Catholic Church

440
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,240
so importantly at roughly the same time

441
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,198
a lot of American mycologists were also

442
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,720
studying at spum and uh they were

443
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,240
reclassifying the asperula species so

444
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,399
Charles Tom and Margaret church publish

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,360
a big monograph reclassifying the family

446
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,839
at around this time or the genus around

447
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,159
this time so Smith's work took that kind

448
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,000
of laboratory mological research and

449
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,480
combined it with a much more economic

450
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,639
orientation and it showed how laboratory

451
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,920
micology could really have a sort of

452
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,399
major economic signific ific an This

453
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,439
research was pretty important people

454
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,838
were interested in it so race bought

455
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,919
brought him to the London School of

456
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:09,558
hygiene and tropical medicine to work on

457
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,079
Industrial micology

458
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,918
full-time so Smith's book introduced

459
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,558
industrial micology it would go on to

460
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,880
have six editions it was a pretty

461
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:19,519
popular text but it Remains the case

462
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,480
that this sort of general area of

463
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,639
research only became truly popular

464
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,240
because of World War

465
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,240
II as Smith explained toward the end of

466
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,679
the conflict quote before the war much

467
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,400
of the loss in tropical countries caused

468
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,759
by molds was taken for granted and

469
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,080
moreover there was no coordinating body

470
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,759
like the ministry of Supply to initiate

471
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,879
research which would benefit many

472
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,839
different Industries there simply had

473
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,080
not been enough modern military

474
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,279
equipment in a tropical place like New

475
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,319
Guinea to justify research at the

476
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,759
necessary

477
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,119
scale a similar thing is true many of

478
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,319
you probably know for penicillin the

479
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,119
antibiotic activity of penicillin which

480
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,960
is produced from penicilium molds was

481
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,079
known for decades ades before World War

482
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,440
II but it was only produced at

483
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,720
industrial scales because the war added

484
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,440
sort of millions of dollars into finding

485
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,759
ways to produce penicillin much faster

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,558
so World War II is often thought of

487
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,279
generally as the physicists War uh and

488
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,720
and people think of this fellow here

489
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,000
Oppenheimer but I think that we can also

490
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,720
think about World War II as The Mists

491
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
War because without Mists the war would

492
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,159
have gone dramatically

493
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,679
differently in retrospect it's a little

494
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,880
surprising that it took this kind of

495
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
large scale International conflict to

496
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,840
get people interested in the question of

497
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,319
tropical

498
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,199
deterioration uh after all the bananas

499
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,798
that arrived from Central America to

500
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,120
places like New Orleans which is shown

501
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,480
here in the 1920s were gathered in

502
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,558
tropical climates by workers whose

503
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,919
Health was a major economic and social

504
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,558
concern at that time Public Health

505
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,520
researcher Alfred Reid for instance

506
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,038
explained in an overview of the field of

507
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,679
tropical medicine that attention to

508
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,720
Tropical medicine was appeared was one

509
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,720
key indication that everywhere Commerce

510
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,679
business and government are recognizing

511
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,679
that more and more of mankind must live

512
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
in close relationship with the tropics

513
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,759
so there was this idea that a lot of

514
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,679
Western folks were moving to the tropics

515
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,798
and that it needed to be made safe for

516
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,679
them one uh example from the time this

517
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,440
is a 1914 newspaper headline of a speech

518
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,759
by uh Army Surgeon General William

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
gorgus who said that science had so

520
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,079
advanced in the last decade it is now

521
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,880
safe for any white man to make his home

522
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,879
in the tropics so this was a time uh but

523
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,760
as you can tell the focus here was

524
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,880
really on making white people safe from

525
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,720
tropical diseases not so much on the

526
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,960
technological infrastructures that

527
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,440
existed in tropical

528
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,519
places it was instead the mass

529
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,400
quantities of material moving during

530
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,079
World War II that made this

531
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,120
consideration somewhat

532
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,240
unavoidable according to one early

533
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:57,199
estimate nearly 50% of all items shipped

534
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,679
by the British military to Burma were

535
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
lost in transit or sort of dest

536
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,038
destroyed by molds in transit uh which

537
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
is an astonishing amount of stuff if you

538
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,440
think about it uh as researchers learned

539
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,360
the majority of then identified molds

540
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,480
live really well between 75 and 85

541
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,798
degrees at high levels of humidity which

542
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,919
was the exact conditions that were found

543
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,759
throughout this region so this was kind

544
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,880
of mold heaven and it and it w havoc on

545
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,200
a lot of their stuff in the early 1940s

546
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,440
uh scientific collaboration began

547
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,080
between Australia England and the United

548
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,558
States which sort of pooled findings

549
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,480
together to figure out how could we

550
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,399
protect all of our stuff from

551
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,798
destruction by mold and

552
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,038
humidity on the American side the

553
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,839
research organization was partly led by

554
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:45,200
this man Selman wman who is better known

555
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,439
for coining the word the term antibiotic

556
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,319
and leading the discovery of strepto but

557
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,360
wman was important in leading the kind

558
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,240
of American side of the tropical

559
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,519
deterioration fight over the course of

560
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,599
the Allied work the Australians found

561
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,079
for instance that us packed things were

562
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,199
were a lot better than British packed

563
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,519
things uh I'm not totally sure why but

564
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Americans were I guess just better at

565
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,519
that um and this was actually one of the

566
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,519
major Revelations that pushed Australia

567
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,639
away from a traditional relationship

568
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
with England and toward a relationship

569
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,400
with the United States so the kind of

570
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,278
Australian American technological

571
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,240
relationship really got going at this

572
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,599
moment in World War

573
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,880
II because of the urgency of this

574
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,240
concern research initially took place in

575
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,320
Metropolitan Laboratories so in London

576
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,480
Smith and rri at the school of hygiene

577
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,079
and tropical medicine became kind of the

578
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,000
semi-formal experts on how to protect

579
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,678
things from tropical

580
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
deterioration they constructed tropical

581
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,798
Chambers where temperature and humidity

582
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,359
could be kept at artificially elevated

583
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,038
levels to facilitate mold growth and to

584
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,439
try to kind of test product

585
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:53,960
deterioration as simulations of a a

586
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,360
farway environment I think the that they

587
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,038
didn't really understand very well these

588
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,439
experiments are really important as an

589
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,158
attempt to kind of domesticate far away

590
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,558
tropical places and recreate them inside

591
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,200
of temperate uh climates so the same way

592
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,879
that we can uh grow all kinds of

593
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,240
wonderful trees here despite the snow in

594
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,240
IA um but the question uh was or the

595
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,000
problem was this didn't work that well

596
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,798
for them these these tropical Chambers

597
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,159
just didn't uh produce the right

598
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:21,759
conditions so as the war pressed onwards

599
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
it was also deemed important to

600
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,960
establish tropical testing stations

601
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,319
throughout the

602
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,159
world so in the early 1940s the Britain

603
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,000
found founded the West African tropical

604
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,360
testing establishment in colonial

605
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Nigeria in Port harcour which you'll

606
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,519
see oh I lost my little arrow down kind

607
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,880
of the bottom on the coast uh and uh

608
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,558
Port harcour there we go yep there's the

609
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,320
arrow and at the station both electrical

610
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,879
and textile goods were tested

611
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,678
aggressively in sort of similar tropical

612
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,799
conditions to see how they would hold up

613
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,440
over time what kinds of products could

614
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,918
protect them from

615
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,798
deterioration an exhibit in Australia in

616
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,360
July 1945 confirmed just how Central

617
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
packing seemed to be for the war effort

618
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,599
we don't typically think of like

619
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,640
waterproof cardboard as an exciting

620
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,439
development of World War II but here it

621
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
is literally Central in this Museum

622
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,159
exhibit to like what are the

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,240
technological developments of the

624
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,240
period Tropic proofed items emerged as a

625
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,278
really visible s signal that could be

626
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,558
shared with the public of the kind of

627
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,558
Innovations of the Allied military's

628
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:31,038
flexible approach to Warfare there were

629
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,000
similar exhibits also in the UK which

630
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,240
kind of showcased these findings to the

631
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,720
general public so Tropic packaging

632
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,919
became this really essential example of

633
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,480
sort of how uh how adaptable the

634
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,480
American and British militaries

635
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,320
were by the end of the war Electronics

636
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,798
were being hermetically sealed to resist

637
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,200
moisture B binoculars were shipped with

638
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,278
silica gel inside to to resist in molds

639
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,080
packaging materials were now waterproof

640
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:00,159
and resistant to humidity so an entire

641
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,639
tropical iCal sort of protection regime

642
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,240
had come into operation and these

643
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
developments were very much a shared

644
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,200
project but if British researchers like

645
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,360
Smith and rrick had had kind of the

646
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,400
initial Advantage by the end of the war

647
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,359
it was really American myologist who

648
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,440
were the leaders in the development of a

649
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,399
lot of these findings for instance the

650
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,159
tropical deterioration information

651
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,480
center which was located at George

652
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,520
Washington University became kind of the

653
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,599
centerpiece of collating all the

654
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,119
information that existed about mold

655
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,278
management and

656
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,798
prevention many British researchers

657
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,398
found this to be a rather upsetting

658
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:38,480
development because they had been the

659
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,639
traditional experts in micology now it

660
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,919
was in the United States that sort of

661
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,240
fungal knowledge was most wide was was

662
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,880
best kept and this was a scientific

663
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,558
shifting of the guard that had really

664
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,919
important implications for the history

665
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,759
of biology in the 20th century uh Tropic

666
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,600
proofing may not have really won the war

667
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,879
for the Allies but I think it aided in

668
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,599
their fight and it caused some major

669
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,360
changes

670
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,398
the first and I think most important for

671
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,398
those who work here is that it spurred a

672
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,678
really large transformation in the field

673
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:10,158
of what we maybe now think of as fungal

674
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,120
biology so in his presidential address

675
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,080
to the mological Society of America in

676
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,000
1949 Fred Sparrow who you see here

677
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,240
explained quote that the field of

678
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,440
micology has been given a new impetus

679
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,558
and drive in the United States in recent

680
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,278
years for many years research in

681
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,678
micology has been primarily

682
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,880
morphological and taxonomic and it has

683
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,200
been fruitful work work indeed but new

684
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,000
research Sparrow continued was making

685
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,480
possible the recent development and

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
expansion almost by Leaps and Bounds of

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,360
new fields of investigation and in one

688
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,919
of the examples of these sort of new

689
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,319
fields that were really important he

690
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
talked about new research on

691
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,398
neurospora uh Sparrow perceived the

692
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,879
emergence of what he called a new

693
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,199
micology and he argued that the MSA

694
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,399
needed to adapt itself to this new

695
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,440
biological laboratory style of inquiry

696
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:02,119
Mists were no longer princip taxonomic

697
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,440
botanists they were practically inclined

698
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,278
they worked with the military they

699
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,080
worked with agricultural groups and

700
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,359
increasingly much of their research was

701
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,278
focused in high-tech Laboratories they

702
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,719
use things like electron

703
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,440
microscopes and a major cause of this

704
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,839
change Sparrow mentioned in his

705
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,640
presentation was the war that it had

706
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,519
given tons of money to a lot of these

707
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,440
researchers and allowed them to develop

708
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:28,519
brand new biological uh research

709
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,240
regimes it's around the same time the

710
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,000
mid

711
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,880
1950s that oh they're coming that

712
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,880
Jeffrey anworth started to publish a

713
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,240
series of articles on a problem that was

714
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,039
facing researchers of his generation

715
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,720
there was too much mological information

716
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,240
for them to keep up with there's just

717
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,038
too much knowledge in a lecture he gave

718
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,640
to graduate students at the University

719
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,879
of Wisconsin in 1962 answorth explained

720
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,159
quote mological information is

721
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
increasing exponentially and the

722
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,278
literature of micology is today

723
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,240
published in more language and scattered

724
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,880
through more Publications than ever

725
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,919
before Mists in common with other

726
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,760
scientists have the problems of noting

727
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,440
sorting storing and retrieving

728
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,398
information problems that are

729
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Complicated by the fact that in addition

730
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,759
to the literature much mological

731
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,880
information is kept as dead specimens

732
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,679
preserved in herbaria and as living

733
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,760
specimens conserved in culture

734
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,159
collections so many of you are probably

735
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,960
familiar with this idea that there's too

736
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,919
much science to keep up with but the

737
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,240
point is that this was already acutely

738
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,120
felt in 1950

739
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,759
and in fact it was felt even earlier

740
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,759
than that so the third group in this

741
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,359
figure uh that I think looks like a kind

742
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,240
of avantgard heavy metal band is Italian

743
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:43,439
myologist Pierre Andrea sardo in the

744
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,798
late 1800s sardo began collecting all

745
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,558
known species of fungi with the help of

746
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:50,038
a bunch of assistants into a single

747
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,158
multivolume book which he called the

748
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,798
solo fungorum omnium hus cognitum the

749
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,559
the collection of all presently known

750
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,798
fungi he wrote it in Latin because he

751
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,519
considered Latin a universal language

752
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,359
that everyone could speak and so it

753
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,880
solved the problem of translation you

754
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,439
have Italians you have Americans you

755
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,200
have Japanese folks they're all doing

756
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,960
micology but they can't speak to each

757
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,480
other well if they use Latin that'll

758
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,440
solve all of those

759
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,640
issues he sent letters and postcards

760
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,798
like this one below to researchers all

761
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,080
around the world to exchange samples

762
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,798
turning the botanic garden in Padua into

763
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,000
a kind of Center place for the

764
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,240
collection of specimens and this this

765
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,119
sort of male exchange was uniquely

766
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,159
possible at this moment in time because

767
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,319
the universal Postal Union had just

768
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,200
gotten started during this period so in

769
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,839
the past if you sent a postcard you had

770
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,519
to worry about the local cost exchanging

771
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,558
your money whether you'd be charged

772
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,278
extra at Transit the universal Postal

773
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,519
Union meant that sardo could send a

774
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,519
letter from Padua it would get to

775
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,519
America and everyone is paying roughly

776
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,960
the same price so the ex the the

777
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,919
exchange of exata things like that was

778
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,440
uniquely possible in this

779
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,720
moment sardo got started in the early

780
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,640
1880 and he thought that he could list

781
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,240
every species of fungus uh within 8

782
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,120
years unfortunately it turned out that

783
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,679
it was a really difficult project and he

784
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,719
was still working on it uh and the 25th

785
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,759
volume came out in 1931 so for almost 50

786
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,759
years his most of his life sakaro was

787
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:20,440
trying to list all of the

788
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,158
species and even more recently we know

789
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,720
that the arrival of Internet enabled

790
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,960
micology in the 1990s did not cause the

791
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,038
information problem to disappear but

792
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,200
rather to mutate so in a 1998 paper

793
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,919
Kathy hodj and Tom vulk predicted that

794
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,240
the worldwide web would enable

795
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,120
researchers across the planet to search

796
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,319
large databases of species and access

797
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,439
specimen identification keys that were

798
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,278
formerly only available to those with

799
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,159
privileges at specialty libraries so

800
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,599
there's kind of a democratizing vision

801
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,360
of mological research and I I'll say

802
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,398
that they were right about this uh that

803
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,599
you can do all of these things now right

804
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,319
but Scholars at the time also worried

805
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,639
that this this internet enabled micology

806
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,240
was creating new problems for For the

807
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,038
Working scientist after all if a species

808
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,480
was first published online and the

809
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,679
website went away how could you ensure

810
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,440
that that information would be saved how

811
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,360
could you believe that something was a

812
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,120
species if it wasn't published in a book

813
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,839
I think today we're now very aware that

814
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:21,000
when databases disappear a lot of

815
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,798
knowledge can go with them and even more

816
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,880
close to the present with the flood of

817
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,079
new possible species identified with

818
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,600
Advanced sequencing techniques yet

819
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:30,639
without obvious morphological

820
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,158
characteristics there are new questions

821
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,278
about what it means to name or identify

822
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,120
an organism in the first place so what

823
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,398
I'm hoping to suggest here is that I

824
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,359
think history can help Orient us uh to

825
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,158
some of these ongoing conversations

826
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,479
about arranging and controlling

827
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
mological knowledge subsequent

828
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,120
Generations have felt flooded by

829
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,720
overwhelming quantities of information

830
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:54,678
for over over a hundred years each time

831
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,558
made possible by new technological

832
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,519
developments of their ages each of these

833
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:00,440
Generations

834
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,359
developed new tools and new ways of

835
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,679
coping with this changing world of

836
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,839
information but it was really the war

837
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
that kind of got a lot of this started

838
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,798
and and sort of made the massive

839
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,599
expansion of micology

840
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:15,759
possible so that's the kind of

841
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,638
scientific transformation but another

842
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,440
major sort of result of a lot of this

843
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,678
wartime Research into tropical

844
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,960
deterioration was in how this affected

845
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,038
the world of Industrial Products and

846
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,038
their movement around the globe

847
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,159
the US tropical deterioration

848
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,759
information center which was that

849
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:35,960
bibliography group I mentioned rebranded

850
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,759
in 1945 as the prevention of

851
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,200
deterioration Center its bibliographers

852
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,798
carefully collected all kinds of

853
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,639
information about deterioration problems

854
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,599
but the name change I think signaled

855
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:49,000
that they were expanding from a focus on

856
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,918
tropical questions to deterioration at

857
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,038
the kind of broadest possible

858
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,519
level in 1954 they published a general

859
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:58,519
guide the deterioration of materials

860
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,120
which its cover celebrated as quote the

861
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,319
first book ever published to cover all

862
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,199
aspects of deterioration prevention

863
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,398
which is very exciting claim you can

864
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,639
imagine uh and the center which

865
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,719
continued operations until 1964

866
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,000
continued to receive extensive support

867
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,278
from all the branches of the American

868
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,480
Military and part of the reason is that

869
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:20,558
the American Military did not give up on

870
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,159
the importance of tropical deterioration

871
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,519
after World War II instead the US kept

872
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,600
access to Tropical testing facilities in

873
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,679
places like Panama uh and uh Britain

874
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,158
maintained access to them until uh they

875
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,840
were kicked out of Nigeria when it

876
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,880
became an independent country in

877
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:40,158
1958 uh well they they closed in 1958

878
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,840
Independence came later uh the US

879
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,399
military has has fought to maintain

880
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,798
these and part of the reason is that

881
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:46,759
studies in the middle of the 20th

882
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,879
century predicted that all future

883
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,798
conflicts were likely to take place in

884
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,120
tropical environments so the American

885
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,519
Military had to continuously test all of

886
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,398
its goods in tropical

887
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,839
places this kind of came to a head in

888
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,678
1977 when the Carter T rehost treaty

889
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,519
required the US to leave Panama

890
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,519
potentially lose access to this tropical

891
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,399
testing facility uh that didn't quite

892
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,038
happen and the US actually maintains a

893
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:13,278
lot of tropical testing all across the

894
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,398
globe so what I'm hoping to kind of

895
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,398
suggest also is that this this early

896
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:19,479
sort of mological research focus into

897
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,398
tropical deterioration was not just

898
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,639
important for scientists it also

899
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,959
underwrote an expansion of the American

900
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:28,158
Military all across the planet in a

901
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,319
vision of sort of American milit Ary

902
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,559
power that could be projected anywhere

903
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,398
at any time because American Guns could

904
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,000
be safe and protected whether they're

905
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,839
here whether they're in Guam or whether

906
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,919
they're somewhere else so it didn't just

907
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,480
change science it really changed how the

908
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,240
American Military imagined its Readiness

909
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,720
on a global

910
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,480
scale and it also really affected

911
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,079
visions of post-war International Trade

912
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,960
so after the war you have a lot of

913
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,158
companies who emerge and start to talk

914
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,240
about the exciting new ability for

915
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,360
American corporations to expand their

916
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,319
business across the

917
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,278
planet in 1944 John Glenn of the

918
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,000
Pan-American Trust Company noted that

919
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,599
American Business could take advantage

920
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,760
of post-war World Trade expanding into

921
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,679
new markets he wrote that the

922
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,760
restoration of world economy after the

923
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,480
war will offer a tremendous opportunity

924
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,399
to American production and importantly

925
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,079
he stressed that this opportunity would

926
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:23,960
rely on willingness to take advantage of

927
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,000
all of these wartime developments in

928
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,199
packaging and

929
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,838
shipping the new technique developed

930
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,719
during the war were perceived as sort of

931
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,119
essential elements of the expansion of

932
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,158
American corporate uh uh sort of

933
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,200
development a Scientific American

934
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,720
explained in

935
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,598
1945 commercial shippers may not be

936
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,759
working in quite the same areas but they

937
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,159
could use these new Tropical Shipping

938
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,599
and prevention discoveries in order to

939
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,280
sell their goods in all kinds of places

940
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,000
you could build a motorcycle in the

941
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,560
United States you could get it to the

942
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,719
Philippines and it would be in fine

943
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:58,320
working condition when it arrived so it

944
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,000
enabled this vision of a truly GL Global

945
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,599
kind of capitalist

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,719
Enterprise there were a vast array of

947
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,599
research programs into various sort of

948
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,039
modes of fungus prevention and Tropic

949
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,480
proofing paper and paperboard got

950
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:14,239
studied extensively and I'll just note

951
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,440
that this uh study for instance

952
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,559
emphasized that trade with tropical

953
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,480
areas was increasing so the reason for

954
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,440
doing a lot of This research was this

955
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,039
expansion in tropical trade there are

956
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,000
countless examples of This research I

957
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,639
won't list all of them but much of it

958
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,079
concerns this idea of adapting wartime

959
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,400
discoveries to the new peaceful uh

960
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,599
post-war

961
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,480
environment and even at the height of

962
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,720
optimism about peaceful uses of

963
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,480
radioactivity there were Suggestions by

964
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,919
some people that you could zap

965
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,400
underground cables uh with high levels

966
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,039
of radi radiation to keep fungi from

967
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,559
destroying them so a lot of ways to to

968
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,599
fungus proof the the New World

969
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,039
Order there's one more important

970
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,960
development that I think came from a lot

971
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,119
of this and it concerns a new material

972
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,358
that was popular IED during this period

973
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,039
because of its fungal resistance so PVC

974
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:08,759
or polyvinyl chloride was discovered in

975
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,559
1872 by chemist oan Balman but it only

976
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,720
received widespread application in the

977
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,119
1930s and 1940s after chemist Waldo

978
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:18,559
Seaman at the Goodrich company boiled

979
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,599
some waste PVC and turned it into this

980
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,599
flexible plastic virtually immune to

981
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,160
fungal deterioration PVC was used widely

982
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,480
after the war for things like vinyl

983
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,480
record

984
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,559
uh pipes and even uh some mini golf

985
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,920
hazards in 1966 the Goodrich company

986
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,318
produced 260 million pounds of PVC a

987
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,240
year and today the most recent estimate

988
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:45,639
I could find is that nearly six billion

989
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,799
pounds of PVC is produced annually in

990
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,679
the United States so massive amounts of

991
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,960
this

992
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,960
stuff and the problem as you can

993
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,039
probably predict or already know is that

994
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,720
PVC is extremely damaging to the

995
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,639
environment both its production and its

996
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,078
life cycle rele release harmful

997
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,480
chemicals that build up in water air

998
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,839
food chains Etc and cause a variety of

999
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,199
human health problems so I think from

1000
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,799
the present sort of vantage point we can

1001
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,118
tell a very different story about fungal

1002
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,359
deterioration this was not just a

1003
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,559
development about kind of miraculously

1004
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:20,719
overcoming the environment and building

1005
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,480
all these wonderful fungus proof things

1006
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,598
but of creating a host of new materials

1007
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,199
and processes that didn't just resist

1008
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,160
the environment but actually potentially

1009
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,239
Destro destroyed the environment so it

1010
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:34,159
was a a multifaceted uh

1011
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,838
transformation and today with all the

1012
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,759
stories about how fungi might save us

1013
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,279
we're experiencing a kind of ironic

1014
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,599
inversion of a lot of this history as

1015
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,720
unrecyclable Plastics give way to

1016
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,318
sustainable Alternatives now you have

1017
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,759
the idea that we can actually build all

1018
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,400
of our shipping boxes out of fungi

1019
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,280
themselves so you don't need to Pro you

1020
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,880
don't need to protect boxes from fungi

1021
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,599
you can build boxes out of them uh

1022
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,800
industrial micology is thus kind of

1023
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,720
reemerging to neutralize a problem

1024
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,240
partly of its own

1025
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,919
making industrial micology was thus an

1026
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,719
essential component in the system of

1027
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,039
production and exchange that expanded

1028
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,239
around the world after World War II the

1029
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,039
universe of fast-moving Commodities in

1030
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,838
waterproof boxes with those little

1031
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,440
desiccating silica gel packets that you

1032
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,880
never totally know what to do with

1033
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,679
shielded by plastic wrap all of this got

1034
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,400
started after World War II and it was

1035
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,960
made possible by Major advances in

1036
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,119
micology the system as we know is also a

1037
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,000
rather intive one and by studying how

1038
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,599
sort of this this knowledge changed and

1039
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,559
transformed how it was lost how it

1040
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,599
developed I'm hoping we can better

1041
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,039
approach the present and the ecological

1042
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,599
problems that we deal with

1043
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:46,039
today now I'll end by returning to a

1044
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,200
more basic question uh for you all which

1045
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:49,880
is what it means to study a fungus and

1046
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,199
why anyone would want to do that in the

1047
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,200
first

1048
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,159
place so in 2011 the late Cornell Mist

1049
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,318
dick Corf addressed address the Congress

1050
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:04,039
of Latin American micology at the time

1051
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:06,279
cor worried that granting agencies were

1052
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,759
now aggressively dictating what kinds of

1053
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,000
research people could do the traditional

1054
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,040
Ivory Tower he worried was disappearing

1055
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,480
it was being destroyed by commercial

1056
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,920
forces which I think we're familiar with

1057
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,440
but Corf insisted that I do not find

1058
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,400
this to be a doomsday picture but rather

1059
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,200
a candid view of our future in which we

1060
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,639
can hope by changing our Focus to pursue

1061
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,358
the Holy Grail of saving whatever we can

1062
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:32,480
of our natural diversity I see this as a

1063
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:34,598
moral duty and I'm convinced that we

1064
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,119
have the ability to change our Focus to

1065
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,800
one of serving Society so in a

1066
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,920
complicated moment like the one we find

1067
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,000
ourselves in today perhaps we can take

1068
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,159
some solace in knowing that others have

1069
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,480
faced down a lot of the problems about

1070
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,759
funding uh political involvement with

1071
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,920
research and we can embrace the work of

1072
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,839
saving what we can I'll stop there

1073
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,838
thanks so much everyone for

1074
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,838
listening yeah and I yeah

1075
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,559
um you didn't mention it but I'm curious

1076
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,960
if part of the research for your book

1077
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:07,199
includes like culinary

1078
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,720
micology yeah uh can you can you say

1079
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,519
more about what just like the either I'm

1080
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,239
thinking of like culinary like

1081
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:18,838
production for edible mushrooms but also

1082
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:22,000
I guess like foring big thing yeah yeah

1083
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,920
absolutely so uh yeah I almost I almost

1084
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,159
talked about this today in fact so I I'm

1085
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,079
sorry I feel like I missed an

1086
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,078
opportunity one interesting part about

1087
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,039
it there's a major transformation in how

1088
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,880
how mushrooms are grown and produced for

1089
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,639
for agriculture starting in the late

1090
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,039
19th century continuing into the early

1091
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,239
20th century so in the early 1800s you

1092
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,838
have these like interesting French guys

1093
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,919
who start going into the catacombs of

1094
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,078
Paris and growing mushrooms underground

1095
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,400
which they realized it's the perfect

1096
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,359
place to do it because it's kind of

1097
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,280
artificially temperature controlled it's

1098
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,598
protected from rain etc etc and this

1099
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,319
idea of using caves to grow mushrooms

1100
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,559
become super super popular at the end of

1101
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,440
the century uh you have Americans try to

1102
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,400
do it for instance Mammoth Cave the

1103
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,960
national park this kind of fails because

1104
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,079
it turns out there isn't a big Market in

1105
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Kentucky for mushrooms but you get a lot

1106
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,079
of these projects to kind of turn caves

1107
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,119
and abandon tunnels Etc into into

1108
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,640
mushroom production facilities but the

1109
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,599
Americans make really major advances in

1110
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,639
pure culturing and then growing

1111
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,000
mushrooms in sort of uh controlled like

1112
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,838
outside green houses and stuff so that's

1113
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,639
how you get to the fact that kenet

1114
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,838
square for instance is now you know one

1115
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,039
of the World Mushroom production uh uh

1116
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,519
meccas uh and a lot of this has to do

1117
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,519
with with sort of research in a little

1118
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,000
bit of an earlier time period but that

1119
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,639
takes some of these pure culture

1120
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,280
techniques and then applies them to

1121
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,879
agricultural production so it's part of

1122
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,119
the project and I am interested in kind

1123
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,559
of tracing this further also there's a

1124
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,200
kind of connected question of like

1125
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,279
production of soy sauce and a lot of

1126
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,279
these culinary products that require

1127
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,119
kind of industrial uh mological work so

1128
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,119
so all of this will hopefully be in the

1129
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,119
book but thank you for the

1130
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,160
question yeah um thanks for your talk it

1131
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,159
was really great you mentioned that uh

1132
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,039
it's kind of surprising that it took so

1133
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,159
long for industrial micology to emerge

1134
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:09,880
as as an area of study given how long

1135
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:11,199
before that uh trade in the tropics had

1136
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,400
been going on with perishable things I

1137
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,679
wonder if you could say a bit more about

1138
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,318
why you think it took that why why do

1139
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:19,679
you think it didn't emerge in previous

1140
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:24,039
centuries yeah well I think that part of

1141
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:26,679
the the easy answer I suppose is that uh

1142
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,358
there was not enough stuff yet in

1143
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,838
tropical places and it wasn't

1144
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:33,960
deteriorating at a fast enough rate and

1145
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,119
I mean as as I kind of said here I World

1146
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,119
War II is a really wonderful moment in a

1147
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,240
well not it's a bad

1148
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,119
moment from a kind of industrial and

1149
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,159
scientific standpoint um it's a really

1150
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,280
interesting moment because you have so

1151
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:49,838
much money being invested with very

1152
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,440
little sort of concern about you know

1153
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,159
like wasted funding it's like if there's

1154
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,079
an urgent problem it's worth working on

1155
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,118
and so you get massive investments in

1156
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,800
the problem of tropical deterioration

1157
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:01,680
which are just Unthinkable in any

1158
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,599
earlier decade there's nobody had enough

1159
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,719
money for that to make sense but if our

1160
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,800
soldiers are literally getting lost in

1161
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,879
the jungle because their radio sets are

1162
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,640
being eaten Away by molds and they can't

1163
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,079
even talk to each other they can't see

1164
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,358
through their guns I mean that's a life

1165
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,839
and death problem and so the US military

1166
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,078
invests a massive amount of money and of

1167
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:21,960
course the same is sort of true with the

1168
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,880
Manhattan Project that you have these

1169
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,720
massive fundamental advances in physics

1170
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,480
that are possible because an enormous

1171
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,000
amount of money is invested into these

1172
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,400
questions right during that time period

1173
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
And if I had an audience of of

1174
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,440
politicians here I would argue that that

1175
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,240
that this kind of massive expenditure

1176
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,519
has all kinds of sort of fundamental and

1177
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,679
basic benefits right it's just that that

1178
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:45,400
kind of broad project dream of of sort

1179
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,039
of spending tens or hundreds of millions

1180
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,480
of dollars at a time to solve these

1181
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,159
problems kind of dries up afterwards but

1182
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,920
it just it doesn't exist in kind of the

1183
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:55,399
earlier

1184
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,559
period yeah um I had a question about

1185
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,599
permits when you're talking about the

1186
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,720
exchange material um and collecting all

1187
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,039
the different fungi I imagine that maybe

1188
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,199
it's gotten more like permitting and

1189
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,159
exchange is more restricted over time

1190
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,679
but is that true or does that play out

1191
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:12,399
where there's relaxes in regulation and

1192
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,919
then um stricter regulation is that

1193
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,639
influence the process so this is for

1194
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,400
like collecting samples and and sort of

1195
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,400
shipping them around the world yeah so

1196
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,119
like there's negative impacts by you

1197
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,760
could have Outreach in other areas

1198
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,760
things like that yeah well

1199
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,640
disappointingly in early in the 20th

1200
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,720
century there are very few restrictions

1201
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,400
about uh what you can take from a place

1202
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:37,039
and and ship elsewhere and uh a lot of

1203
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,000
the sort of charm or humor of looking at

1204
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,318
like sardo's correspondence is that the

1205
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,960
biggest problem is just that if someone

1206
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:43,880
shipped something from North America so

1207
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,920
like JB Ellis would send him stuff and

1208
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,160
it it would just get lost at you know

1209
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,960
all the time on boats and and it would

1210
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,759
get stuck at the post office for months

1211
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,358
because the post office didn't know what

1212
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,119
was in it and it was you know the the

1213
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,880
real concern was that it was a weapon or

1214
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,200
you know something was being kind of uh

1215
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,760
illegally moved across International so

1216
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,598
so there's very little concern about

1217
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,839
that early

1218
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,680
on that said there's also not that much

1219
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:13,318
interest at the time in studying the

1220
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:16,039
sort of uh the funga of nonwestern

1221
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,199
places so the really intense focus is on

1222
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:21,199
European North American to some extent

1223
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:23,118
sort of Japanese uh species there's not

1224
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,318
a lot of attention to Central American

1225
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,960
South American African uh populations so

1226
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:32,440
even though there are very few

1227
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:35,000
restrictions the kind of um ideological

1228
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,599
uh Focus meant that a huge amount of of

1229
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
sort of possible questions weren't

1230
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,640
really asked at this time uh in terms of

1231
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,480
species that could have been studied but

1232
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,000
just there wasn't enough attention to

1233
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,480
them um it definitely changes of course

1234
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,119
as you get into the later 20th century

1235
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,318
when things become a lot harder to just

1236
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,318
kind of pick up and ship around but um

1237
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:54,480
yeah there weren't there weren't a lot

1238
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,960
of restrictions early on and uh Curtis

1239
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,760
Gates Lloyd is a wonderful sort of

1240
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,440
mological History figure that some may

1241
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,040
know about lives in Cincinnati and he

1242
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,400
creates this this journal called

1243
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,400
mological notes and he says that if you

1244
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,639
ship him a mushroom from anywhere in the

1245
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,680
world he will identify it and he'll send

1246
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,000
you a free copy of mological notes and

1247
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,480
he has a bunch of money that he's made

1248
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,199
through pharmaceutical research so he's

1249
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,079
able to do this in a way that most other

1250
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,679
people can't and the amazing thing about

1251
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,039
Lloyd is that he is getting things

1252
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,480
shipped to him from just everywhere

1253
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,480
across the planet at a kind of

1254
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,400
breathtaking scale and develops this

1255
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,280
unbelievable dried specimens collection

1256
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,358
in part because there are almost no

1257
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,800
restrictions and he's got all these guys

1258
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:33,880
like who are just board Colonial

1259
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,519
administrators in like Angola or

1260
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,960
Singapore and they're like you know I

1261
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,519
didn't have much going on so I went out

1262
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,280
the other day I found this mushroom what

1263
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:41,880
is it you know please let me know in a

1264
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,960
couple months so you get this kind of

1265
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,000
spectacular international trade at that

1266
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,880
time uh but it's also it's slow to

1267
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
communicate there's a lot that's lost in

1268
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,720
transit because dried specimens don't

1269
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,440
hold up very well when they're received

1270
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:54,639
so there are different kinds of problems

1271
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,599
at that

1272
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,679
time any other questions from our

1273
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,119
audience

1274
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,440
today well I hope you'll join me oh go

1275
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,119
ahead oh this is a little random but so

1276
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,240
early on you showed the magazine being

1277
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,519
like completely destroyed by mold so I

1278
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,239
imagine that that would be made out of

1279
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,199
metal but molds can't eat metal and so

1280
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:17,159
I'm wondering how like how did it get

1281
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,960
that destroyed that quickly is it just

1282
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,719
like acid production or yeah I mean so

1283
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,440
so there there are a couple problems

1284
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,838
that they deal with during this time and

1285
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,039
there one thing that I suppose I should

1286
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,960
have talked about a little bit more is

1287
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:33,159
that at first the major concern is only

1288
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,199
about mold action so it's initially a

1289
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,159
kind of purely mological concern is like

1290
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,679
how do we stop the molds from getting in

1291
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:41,799
because they do like Cloud gun sits from

1292
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,399
the inside which people can't figure out

1293
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,480
but it does become clear that after a

1294
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,119
while molds aren't the only problem that

1295
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,440
the other problem is just massive

1296
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,440
constant humidity and so you have things

1297
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,639
that are just in very wet environments

1298
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,960
Where Metal is corroding very very

1299
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,078
quickly over extended periods and it's

1300
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:02,079
kind of the combined effect of kind of

1301
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:04,160
moisture corrosion and kind of fungal

1302
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,880
activity that causes this like massive

1303
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,960
destruction so boxes get destroyed by

1304
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,800
fungi but then you know Metals get sort

1305
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,079
of ruined by by all kinds of other like

1306
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,039
rust and and other

1307
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,039
processes all right well will you join

1308
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,239
me and thanking Brad for thank you all

1309
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,239
so

1310
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,838
much this has been a production of

1311
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,838
Cornell University on the web at

1312
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:29,838
