1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:13,699
so everyone today I'm going to present

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,339
my results on genome-wide Association

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:21,609
study and genomic prediction for mineral

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:25,100
levels in my screen so mineral nutrition

7
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,919
nutrient deficiencies are very can cause

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,190
very serious health problems including

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,230
so for example iron deficient anemia and

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:38,239
as you can see in this map some

11
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:41,088
especially in developing nations some

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,698
can have over 40 percent of the

13
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:48,679
population and that can be affected by

14
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:53,509
anemia and just to put things into

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:56,030
perspective the current status in the

16
00:00:53,509 --> 00:01:00,349
current concentration in maize kernels

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,260
are not enough to meet the recommended

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,978
daily allowance and this is especially

19
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:11,230
the case where in the areas were amazed

20
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:16,400
our staple foods so in the first row

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:19,070
here you can see the RDA for iron zinc

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,950
and note that the male and female have

23
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:25,399
different recommendations and the second

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,960
row here are the USDA's maze average in

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,890
try kernels so for iOS 2.7 and for zinc

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:36,649
is 2.2 which is like far less than the

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,930
recommendation and in the third row here

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,730
I'm presenting the harvest as breeding

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:45,500
goal for iron zinc so for iron six

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,380
milligram per kilogram and for zinc is

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,099
3.8 and that's the goal we're being

32
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:57,709
working for so there are two goals for

33
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:59,719
this study we're going to we're trying

34
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:03,709
to do that reintroduction important

35
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:06,230
tonight mineral levels in green and this

36
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:08,118
including this includes performed to

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,450
provoke us to help identify the

38
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:15,009
causative low side and then to build and

39
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,009
validate the GP models

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,250
we're using a population so it is a

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,329
panel it's a collection of for about

42
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,539
2000 mazing breadline and it captures a

43
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:31,959
high level of little diversity and as

44
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:35,048
you can see in the MDS cloudy has like

45
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:39,120
now sniffs dog sniffs dogs germplasm and

46
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:43,629
also have like tropical exception

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:48,879
so thanks panel was grown in 2012 and

48
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:52,090
2013 at Purdue West Lafayette the

49
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,668
Colonel's were then sent to Flinders

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,090
University to be grounded and then

51
00:02:54,669 --> 00:03:01,209
performed the icp-ms will perform to

52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:07,090
generate the phenotypic data and from

53
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:10,030
there so this is what Oh like we're

54
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,848
doing so is to generate flux and then

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,049
with genotype data from Pangea we're

56
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:20,259
able to perform to us and GP study so

57
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:23,229
for now we only have one year's data

58
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:25,448
which is 2012 so all the results I'm

59
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:35,349
presenting today are based on one year's

60
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:38,680
data so I calculated flux so as you can

61
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:42,848
see here they're near normal

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,209
distribution but when we compare back to

63
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:50,168
what we talked about before so the

64
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:55,539
average in my panel of iron zinc are 2.3

65
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:58,719
and 3.1 so for zinc is near the winning

66
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:02,469
goal but for iron even like my best

67
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,989
clients do not have cannot reach the

68
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:10,090
harvesters reading goal so we have a

69
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:14,469
long way to go so this is showing the

70
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:17,519
pairwise trade correlations so all the

71
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:20,680
nine traits are positively correlated

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,250
and the highest correlation is between

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,158
phosphorus and magnesium and iron zinc

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,800
are actually moderate moderate Hill

75
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:32,449
Carla

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,418
with 0.53 coefficient so this is good

77
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:39,259
news because we want to improve the two

78
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:42,519
traits together in the maze kernel so

79
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:46,930
some of the some of these traits can be

80
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:50,389
is very good for GI study like

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:55,728
molybdenum so it is mostly controlled by

82
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,949
a single large effect locus so as you

83
00:04:55,728 --> 00:05:01,329
can see in the Manhattan part here in

84
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:04,639
chromosome one so this gene is actually

85
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:11,029
cloned in a wrap topsis and it is called

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:13,939
MOT one which is a memo transporter so

87
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:19,609
the green line here shows FDR corrected

88
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:23,658
p-value of 0.05 in contrast I am zinc

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,120
there are more polygenic traits so like

90
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:29,680
you can see here there are a lot of

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:34,129
small Peaks that pass the threshold and

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:38,629
there are much more much smaller effect

93
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:42,139
there have much smaller effect sizes so

94
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:47,740
this tells me one thing is that probably

95
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:51,710
for iron zinc are not good for can

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,590
probably a marker-assisted selection are

97
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:56,930
not enough or good enough for iron zinc

98
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:01,369
because they're controlled by so many

99
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:04,699
small more effective QTL so and probably

100
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:09,228
the better method would be genomic

101
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,000
prediction so for the GP we use five

102
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:13,968
fold cross validation and ten iterations

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,718
and i'm showing the average predicts

104
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:21,649
ability and actually iron has the

105
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:26,000
highest predictor predictability of 0.49

106
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:29,829
and for zinc it's not so bad it has a

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,829
predictability of 0.38

108
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:40,290
and then just to make the folios of our

109
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:44,279
GP model we apply the GP model train

110
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,220
down eggs to the cement may sign so this

111
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,909
in theory should have high transfer

112
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,699
ability if the two population share a

113
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:57,540
high number of alleles and as you can

114
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:00,330
see in the PCA here so the blue dots are

115
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,669
the inks channel two yellow dots is the

116
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:06,539
similans and the circle actually is a

117
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:08,789
tropical tropical sub population inside

118
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,470
the inks panel and you can see the

119
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:22,410
similar lines and the tropical lines

120
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:25,710
actually totalized okay so I'm showing

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,180
the genomic estimated breeding value for

122
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:34,739
the same Alliance so it's in the green

123
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:38,009
box plot here is the average GP for CML

124
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,110
using 80 percent of the ink panel as a

125
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:45,089
training set and we did that for five

126
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:48,990
iterations and just as a comparison in

127
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,478
the blue box plots we're showing just

128
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,430
the eggs

129
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:57,149
gbv phalanx training so the

130
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:01,199
cross-validation and as expected it has

131
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:04,348
much smaller variation than the similar

132
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,598
line cells first where have smaller

133
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:14,639
variation than the ink line so which is

134
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:18,168
to be expected because it just colorized

135
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,740
with one of the aims subpopulations and

136
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:26,399
we actually just got the symud

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,430
phenotypes female phenotype from simit

138
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:35,009
center and we're trying to do validation

139
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:37,408
on that so the next step would be to do

140
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,899
fine dissection of the candidate gene

141
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:42,240
regions and especially for the more

142
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,110
tract or traits and then do validation

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,840
of GP modeling

144
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,500
Simmons panel and then ultimately do

145
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:53,500
improvement up mineral trades with

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,980
genomics lecture so with that I would

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,159
like to thank my committee member Mike
