1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,120
University um as Matt said um I'm a

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,759
professor at the University of Wisconsin

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,919
Madison um I've been working with um

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,640
organic agriculture for over 20 years

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,920
now I actually started my career down in

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,039
Mexico State University um and uh really

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,199
struck me the the role of organic in

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,039
terms of building um regenerative act

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,399
systems and and addressing many of the

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,519
challenges we face not only as a nation

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,039
but globally in terms of um having a

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,520
healthy nutritious food supply um

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,039
supporting Farmers U supporting small

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,719
family Farmers supporting beginning

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,160
farmers and supporting soil Health um

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,239
organic is all about soil Health um it's

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,279
all about um building our soil uh

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,759
improving our soil resources and truly

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,719
is the first regen of Agriculture um so

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:05,280
as we look at at uh maintaining and and

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,759
forwarding uh organic practices it's

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,599
it's all grounded in regenerative

24
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,560
agriculture um so I've been working in

25
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,239
organic no tail since that first time in

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,600
New Mexico um looking at how we create

27
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,280
systems that can help preserve our soil

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,599
build our soil so that's been over um 20

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,960
years now and have learned a lot in the

30
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,000
process uh still a lot to learn very

31
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,599
exciting to continue to do the research

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,560
um Matt said a lot of the research that

33
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,919
we have been doing is in partnership

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,399
with Cornell University here in New York

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
and for those of you that don't know

36
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,320
Wisconsin um T to be considered a Fly

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
Over States I don't know how many of you

38
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,158
familiar with Wisconsin versus the

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,640
Cornel there's a lot of similarities to

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,560
the agriculture in New York um we we

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,680
have hiler Landscapes uh a lot of

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,600
organic farmers are farming Bridges and

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,118
valleys a very diverse agiculture

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,438
smaller Farms I have organic daies and

45
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,599
organic vegetables organic gra Farms and

46
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,919
New York and Wisconsin always tend to be

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:06,679
competing for that second place or first

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,959
place position in terms of number of

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,239
organic farms and number of dollars from

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,759
organic ring and dairy farms we always

51
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,319
joging for that leadership position we

52
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,439
won't talk about California you don't

53
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:21,919
know

54
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,919
but so the that I presented um I think

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,759
it's really relevant to York as well and

56
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,119
that certainly good context

57
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,519
talk I think the biggest difference in

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,640
Wisconsin fing rocks like you guys

59
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,200
so we don't have many rocks but in terms

60
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,598
of size of arm resources we have and

61
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,560
even environment really really um have

62
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,119
to give credit this presentation was

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,640
actually made by my research scientist

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,039
Ben Rock so super grateful to Ben and

65
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,759
all the work he's done with data

66
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,878
analysis and just want to give them a

67
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:59,079
huge amount of credit for Ping together

68
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,439
um all right so starting with uh organic

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,360
no till soy and just want to stress as

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,439
well um a lot of my work is in organic

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,440
noil I think it has a really strong

72
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,919
place as we look forward not only to

73
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,519
organic grains but looking at other

74
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,000
organic feeds uh and livestock

75
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,959
production as well as organic vegetables

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,360
but I I certainly am not promoting

77
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,799
organic no as with silver bullet um many

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,120
many long-term studies that have

79
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,519
compared organic and conventional side

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,640
by side and as I mentioned organic truly

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,438
is is um regenerate agiculture the first

82
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,359
regenerate agriculture even with um

83
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:41,280
judicious tillage that integration of

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,560
crop diversity and cover crops Organic

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Farms still are building soil organic

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,759
matter so I don't want to demonize

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,519
tillage I think there's a place for

88
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,039
tillage I think strategic tillage is

89
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,158
important I think we can have very very

90
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,359
good um Organic Farms that are

91
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,399
stewarding the soil with tillage it's

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
all tillage is part of the system and

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,158
organic no till should be considered as

94
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,318
part of system um and when you look at

95
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,840
designing rotations and how do you build

96
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,438
these different ecological tools

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,360
together to create a system that we can

98
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:14,000
lower inputs um we can be building

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,079
nitrogen on the farm we can be um

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,279
lowering our need for um different

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,319
insecticides or other aspects even

102
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,758
organic certified it's all about

103
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,279
building the system so thinking about

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,879
organic noil that is part of the system

105
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,839
so I first started working in organic

106
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,159
noil soybeans

107
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,959
um yeah it's SP about 20 years ago now

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,120
um and had the opportunity to work with

109
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,120
Jeff Moyer so learned a lot from The

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,199
rodale Institute and but they have been

111
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,840
doing in terms of pioneering this Techni

112
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,600
um over the past 20 years I think we

113
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,879
have a lot of success in the organic

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,400
soybean system I think I wouldn't say we

115
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,279
haven't dialed in I don't know if

116
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,279
anything organic can be dialed in

117
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,359
because the eological nature of the

118
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,279
system but this is a system that's

119
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,720
workable and we do have more and more

120
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,478
examples of farms that are making this

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,520
work as part of their uh soybean

122
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,680
approach on their farm and looking at

123
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,240
Market opportunities in terms of organic

124
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,600
grains we're still importing um the

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,439
majority of organic soy beans and I know

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,919
that in Wisconsin at least Farmers AR

127
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,639
organic farmers aren't thrilled about

128
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,879
organic soybeans but it is a sector of

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
the organic grain market that there is

130
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,959
opportunity for grow there is

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,240
opportunity for more domestic production

132
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,239
so looking at these different tools to

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,400
make organic SBE production more

134
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,280
feasible um is also important so the

135
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:41,359
system with Organic um noil sway beans

136
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,399
the first step is Ry establishment so we

137
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,800
typically are using a winter anual

138
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,478
serial grain as the tool for me

139
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,120
management winter Annual Ride tends to

140
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,240
be um the most consistent performer in

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,840
terms of winterial bra it produces a lot

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,439
of biomass um over Winters well and

143
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,279
tends to I I think a bit more AL C in

144
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,759
system that can also help with

145
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:10,000
Le one of the the key aspects of this

146
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,160
system is this planting date for the and

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,918
as we see how this system has failed on

148
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,479
farms where farmers are seeing issues

149
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,758
often times it is tied to this first

150
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,318
step if you look at that first step

151
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,598
right that the system is is going to um

152
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,199
have a high risk of failure so this

153
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,199
first step of planting that ride on time

154
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,080
um in Wisconsin and New York I would

155
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,439
push it past mid-september so this

156
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,719
really requires to be successful of

157
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,560
redesign of the system more broadly

158
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,599
often times in Wisconsin organic grain

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,879
farmers are planted to after corn maybe

160
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,478
you could get a ro planed day

161
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,079
mid-september if you're coming in after

162
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,478
corn silage but typically to get that

163
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,959
early planting day you need to think

164
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,680
about redesigning the system including

165
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,198
winter annuals are summer cere summer

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
cereal grains other lero cereal grains

167
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,879
and finding something that can be

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
harvested so that we can Target this

169
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,919
mid-september planning date um the other

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,399
key um two other keys in terms of what

171
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,918
to look for to make this system

172
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,079
successful at this early step is to go

173
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,359
into a field that has the right weed

174
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,399
pressure so um this is not a clean up

175
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,960
method in fields so it's not a way that

176
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:26,038
we can clean up Le fields and it also is

177
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:29,918
not the best method for suppressing FAL

178
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:32,719
we so thisle quack WS so targeting which

179
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,478
field you're going to try organic noil

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
and choosing fields that don't have

181
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:40,279
excessively High be pressure and that

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,960
aren't struggling with uh perennial GS

183
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,119
the other part in this uh First Step

184
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:49,158
that is key is a seeding rate so we're

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,560
not using a seeding rate for a typical

186
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,560
Ry cover CR coming in after corn which

187
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,240
is maybe a bushel Bush and a half foot

188
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,478
acre we needed to bump this up to get

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
the ground cover and the biomass needed

190
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,758
to suppress we that's usually around the

191
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,720
three B an acre range so investing in

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,639
that higher seating rate is going to pay

193
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,280
off in terms of weed suppression later

194
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,598
so three key aspects of this early step

195
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,959
that's going to set you up for Success

196
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:18,719
the ride winter start growing again May

197
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,638
and we want to terminate at the stage so

198
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,960
you can see where the the flowers are

199
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
coming off the r heads um you can run

200
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,799
your hand across the RADS and see the

201
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,000
yellow pollen sometimes when you're

202
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
roller thing there's clouds of pollen

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,440
that will come tractor driving over the

204
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,360
field heard stories about it actually

205
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,080
clogging the tractor um but that's the

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,278
stage we're targeting going into early

207
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
you're not going to be able to get the

208
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,399
mechanical termination of Ry that's

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,480
going to for that Ry at going into late

210
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,958
um you're going to potentially have

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,839
issues with viable rice seed which

212
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,159
especially is an issue of you're growing

213
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,880
other serial grains within the rotation

214
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,719
especially food Great Grains but I've

215
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,278
even heard of feed grade grains having

216
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,959
issues with some of that bi will rise

217
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,958
causing contamination in

218
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:11,439
that so typically um this stage in

219
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,639
thesis we seeing the ride flower heads

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,279
um that's going to occur on Memorial Day

221
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,838
um June 4th um so that's we're targeting

222
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,639
for mechanical termination of the ride

223
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,240
and the planting dat of soy so early

224
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,480
June um and this is not an uncommon

225
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,799
photo this is a photo of our um research

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,440
field at Arlington Wisconsin so South

227
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,919
Central

228
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,600
that Ryan mat does an excellent job

229
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,120
suppressing weeds so we don't have to go

230
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,320
through and do

231
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,879
cultivation uh the ride takes care of

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,000
the weed management we can roll the ride

233
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,759
plant it and then let it go for the

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
season um and then um harvest in October

235
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,679
this system does push back maturity so

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,639
um it does require to be ready to

237
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:01,319
harvest in late October early November

238
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,319
be able to reach um right stage of SoBe

239
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,039
so different sorts of roller we've tried

240
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,640
we've tried the roil model which many of

241
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,039
you may have seen and associated with

242
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,919
this this is a model that is

243
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,958
manufactured by more local machine

244
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,719
manufacturer in sou Central Wisconsin

245
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,159
but lots of different options in terms

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,079
of r as well we haven't seen a huge

247
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,199
difference in terms of performance I

248
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,439
think it um really there's there's

249
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,959
options that that work

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,680
Parkers so why organic noil um it is

251
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,559
something as we're seeing more extreme

252
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,359
weather seeing more heavy rain events um

253
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,879
it's important as a mitigation tool for

254
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,600
soil loss so um in the Upper Midwest the

255
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,480
corn Bel on average we've lost a third

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,720
of our top soil and that top soil is is

257
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,600
very very difficult to regain um we

258
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,240
certainly can build soil organic matter

259
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,959
within organic systems but to regain

260
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,399
this degree of top soil will take um

261
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,559
decades if not centuries so it's an

262
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,440
important resource that we need to very

263
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,039
aware in terms of our management is

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,360
affecting the maintenance of that

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,120
resource um and how we can protect

266
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,879
it uh so these are some pictures that

267
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,240
we've seen in terms of some Top Soil

268
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,159
loss with some recent Heavy Rain events

269
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
you can see without that soil covered

270
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:23,480
how that um this surface erosion of the

271
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,879
soil versus if you have that dry mat how

272
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,000
that protects and mitigates impacts of

273
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,360
those heavy rains keeps that soil in

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,519
place and also help maintain soil

275
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,480
moisture through throughout the growing

276
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,519
season by um essentially acting as a

277
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,000
barrier prevent evaporation improving

278
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,200
the soil as well um some other examples

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,679
um within our uh in our field of where

280
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,639
there's the open ground um seeing where

281
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,319
there's visible signs of erosion versus

282
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,919
in organic noil where you um have that

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,879
so protected so you can see the

284
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,278
treatment side by side and how that soil

285
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,879
is actually washing and being stopped by

286
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,159
the organic

287
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,439
treatments uh so it does also help from

288
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,000
a labor perspective and from the grand

289
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,680
Farmers I work with that utilize this

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,600
technique it's often not all their

291
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,399
organic soybean Acres but some of their

292
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,839
organic soybean Acres because it helps

293
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,360
spread out the labor and especially in

294
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,480
Seasons like this past season in

295
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,800
Wisconsin where just we were hammered

296
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,278
with rain so to find those windows you

297
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,479
can get out and cultivate was near

298
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,320
impossible and by having a certain

299
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,278
degree of a that you don't have to

300
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,199
cultivate it allows you to more

301
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,838
effectively manage those Acres that you

302
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,919
do need to cultivate so in a typical

303
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
tillage base system in Wisconsin we

304
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,360
typically have two to three pre-plant

305
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,360
Sage passes and then up to three to five

306
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,120
U weed management passes after planting

307
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,519
with our blind cultivation time meeting

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,320
and rotary hoing and our road

309
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,799
cultivation this uh cover mul system

310
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,839
this organic no system basically cuts

311
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,958
out all that for um pre-plant tillage as

312
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,399
well

313
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,559
so a lot of trips off across the field

314
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,278
and this is where a lot of the economics

315
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:11,198
um pay off is less labor um less lar and

316
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,919
tear on your equipment less passes over

317
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,359
the field um so less fuel costs um and

318
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,360
timly think about

319
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,519
mitigating by eliminating that degree of

320
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,800
passes over the Feld also beneficial

321
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
that way so again you know look at the

322
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,399
cost of the system and how the economics

323
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,120
play off by having the labor and fuel

324
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,958
cost reduced by 50% um that that

325
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,679
definitely shows up in POS

326
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:39,439
book uh so yields and this is where

327
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,159
again there's risk in the system that I

328
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
think when we look at how this is

329
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,559
actually executed on farms to have it

330
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,638
more Diversified in terms of the

331
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,679
approach and maybe not having all your

332
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,240
agas of organic noil is smart as we see

333
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,278
more unpredictable weather patterns Happ

334
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,600
year so um this is over the past decade

335
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,159
that we've been doing organic noil 've

336
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,720
been doing it longer just showing the

337
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,958
last few years of data um these are the

338
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,839
yields per acre green bars are no till

339
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,000
um blue bars are killed so you can see

340
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,639
we're typically averaging between 40 and

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,958
65 which an acre um in those two systems

342
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,879
and when we look at this um black line

343
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,758
that is precipitation the amount of

344
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:29,120
rainfall in inches um that is uh we're

345
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,240
seeing during the growing season um you

346
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,919
you can see that when we have less

347
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,360
rainfall when this bar is is lower

348
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,360
that's where you see more of a

349
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,839
difference between those two lines so in

350
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,600
years we have sufficient precipitation

351
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:50,160
like in 2024 we can actually exceed the

352
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,720
uh yield of traditional conventional

353
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,000
organic soybeans because we have that

354
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
weed management tool in place we're not

355
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,799
struggling with getting up and

356
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,919
cultivating during the um the wet

357
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,719
weather

358
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,719
um and we're we're having a system where

359
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,519
we can better manage weeds so when you

360
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,320
see as when these flat bars at its uh

361
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,360
high points there's very little yield

362
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,040
difference but where the system breaks

363
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,720
down where there RIS is in those

364
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,559
extremely dry years because the Ry

365
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,079
essentially acts like a straw and sucks

366
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,399
up a lot of that soil soil moisture and

367
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:28,120
planting into a dry situation within the

368
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,679
r Ry soy definitely struggle so by

369
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,440
having some Acres in traditional organic

370
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,638
soybeans that are cultivated and some in

371
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,199
organic noil you can kind of buffer

372
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,720
against some of this uncertainty in

373
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,879
terms of weather

374
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,879
patterns so profitability um looking at

375
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,879
profitability system these are some um

376
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,559
kind of badly envelope numbers that have

377
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,679
been put together comparing the organic

378
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,599
noil system some the costs in terms of

379
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,120
the different field operations as well

380
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
as different inputs in terms of seed

381
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,959
assuming that even an organic F

382
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,199
operation typically going to be putting

383
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:05,719
in some R cover crop but at that lower

384
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:09,120
seaing rate so because of the fact we do

385
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,040
field passes and lower variable costs um

386
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,519
particularly in terms of um some of the

387
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:18,439
SE costs and some of the passes over the

388
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,639
field that uh we can see that although

389
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,440
there's tight margins that if we can

390
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,198
close that yeld Gap that organic no til

391
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,759
perform organic based systems with

392
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:31,519
respect to the economics of this system

393
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:36,199
uh so looking at um you know where does

394
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:40,360
that pay off if we can get the uh yield

395
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:41,958
um within about uh five bu an acre we

396
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,440
typically see the economics of the

397
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,119
system paying

398
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,079
off so um one of the things I've ended

399
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,480
this summer which was super exciting is

400
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,278
to see how the practices that we've been

401
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,959
researching at our research station

402
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,799
actually translate onto Farms often

403
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,278
times we do at the research station I

404
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,559
criticized of working in a little bit of

405
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,318
a bubble uh we might not be seeing the

406
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,958
realities of of what's happening in

407
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:09,119
organic farm so B went out to organic

408
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,600
farms that were using organic noil to

409
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,759
try to understand what farmers were

410
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,000
doing with Organic noil what challenges

411
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,279
that farmers were facing with the um

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,400
implementation of the system and to see

413
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,359
if there's any trends that we're seeing

414
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,839
across the farm sites that are using

415
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,839
this system so he did this across a mul

416
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,960
state area um in the other West he

417
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,599
looked at Ry management s Management the

418
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,000
equipment that farmers were using and

419
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:42,719
collected arrang of data looking at soil

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,160
nutrients biomass weed biomass and soil

421
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,558
standing y or so standing

422
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,880
yield um so what he found um so farmers

423
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,359
that were using this he he uh went to

424
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
about 14 Farms so proceeding prop like I

425
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,918
mentioned prop rotation is one of the

426
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,240
trickier aspects of the system of dial

427
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
in you have to think of as a system and

428
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,440
what you're going to be planting before

429
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,519
the soybeans what he was Finding was

430
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,240
that most of the Farms were using some

431
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,400
sort of Cal brain that they were

432
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,200
harvesting as a cash FR many of them

433
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,200
were coming in following theat barley

434
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,000
was another one o um in Wisconsin where

435
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,880
we can get some really high yelding porn

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,400
varieties for silage that we can get off

437
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,960
earlier one Farm was using um porn

438
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,038
silage as a proceeding prop and only one

439
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,919
was using porn for brain but having the

440
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,359
serial grains as a proceeding propop

441
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,600
allow for the Farms that were using the

442
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,798
system to get and hit that early

443
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,918
planting day for the ride so the vast

444
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,079
majority with this rotation were hitting

445
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,720
that early September planting date um a

446
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,558
couple of them were pushing out further

447
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,360
uh but also um they were also able to

448
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,440
get that higher VI rate to make the

449
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,959
system work the r varieties they were

450
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,038
using and Gardener and arusip are both

451
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,159
some earlier um maturing varieties so

452
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,079
varieties that are a little bit more

453
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,080
adapted to the system so they can get

454
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:09,558
that earlier termination date and many

455
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,359
of them were also applying manure before

456
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:13,798
Ry and I think this is also an important

457
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,119
part of the success is having adequate

458
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,918
fertility for that Ry cover prop to get

459
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:21,279
the biomass youed for we supression so

460
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,840
the vast majority were treating that rye

461
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,000
as a CR and adding some fertility um

462
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,480
prior to

463
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,839
planting um many of them were planed

464
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,839
before um crimping so this doesn't mean

465
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,720
planting weeks earlier before crimping

466
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,639
but instead essentially going over the

467
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,440
field twice going through the standing

468
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,400
ride to plant the soybeans which helps

469
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,600
facilitate with seed to soil contact

470
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,038
because you're not having to get the

471
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,480
planter through that thick Ry Mulch and

472
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,839
then coming in and crimping right

473
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,240
afterwards there were a couple that were

474
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,038
crimping first and trying to plant

475
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,120
through that mul the vast majority were

476
00:19:54,038 --> 00:20:00,319
planting first and then crimping so

477
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:03,000
planting da um kind of that range in

478
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,519
that late latter part of um May to the

479
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,759
early part of June um those that were

480
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,480
doing in mid May probably were using the

481
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,400
technique where they're planting around

482
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,480
the boot stage of Ry and then letting

483
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,559
the soybeans germinate and then cring

484
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,640
over that s speeding rates and this is

485
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,839
reflective of some really great research

486
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,640
coming out of Cornell is that in this

487
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,439
system going to the heavier s seeding

488
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,759
race is also important for the success

489
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,000
and resilience of the system to even

490
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,919
going up to about 240,000 seats per acre

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,440
many of them most of them were on 30ish

492
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,919
rows a couple of them were on narrow

493
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,159
roow spacing um and and about half of

494
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,759
them or more we're doing some inseason

495
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,960
weed management to help manage some exag

496
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,759
in

497
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,720
sy so looking at the performance

498
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,319
um many of them were targeting the B

499
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,798
majority we targeting um or being able

500
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,240
to achieve the the Ry biomass that we

501
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,679
need to make the system work which is

502
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,599
about 8,000 pounds per acre so having

503
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,679
those earli your planting days that

504
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,839
fertility uh and that heavier Ry seeding

505
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,240
rate was working in their favor and they

506
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,678
getting the Ry VI expression um some of

507
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,839
the Farms were struggling with um weed

508
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,960
suppression as evidenced by this higher

509
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,879
number but most of them were getting

510
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,000
decent weed suppression uh and a range

511
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,559
of different swaying stands so some of

512
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,519
them were struggling a bit with getting

513
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:34,000
that good seat to so contact and getting

514
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:37,119
so stand but the so yields 46 Bush an

515
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,359
acre we can that a pretty decent soy

516
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:42,038
yield in respon so uh farmers were

517
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,678
having success in this system the

518
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,919
farmers that were serving Farmers that

519
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,320
were visited um we're having um success

520
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,640
in terms of getting good biomas getting

521
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,558
good meat suppression and getting good

522
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,038
soybean so it's really exciting to see

523
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:57,720
that the systems that we've been working

524
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,400
so hard to research at Wisconsin and and

525
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Corell

526
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,798
we we're seen in terms of success in the

527
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,000
FI so photograph of the differences so

528
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,558
here we can see a high biomass R feel

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and just you know what a difference

530
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,599
having that heavy Ry biomass where you

531
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,159
can't see any soil vers inadequate

532
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,000
biomass and just how many weeds are

533
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:23,039
breaking through so visual demonstration

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,798
of how important setting up the system

535
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,519
for the high biomasses and then looking

536
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,278
at the inconsistencies and stands so

537
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,359
having this excellent sing stand um

538
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,720
paying attention to planting a planter

539
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,359
set up paying attention to being able to

540
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,120
get that seed in the ground versus the

541
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,759
inconsist

542
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,599
plant so Ry biomass and this is

543
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:46,599
something we see in our research as well

544
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:50,439
was the most important predictor for

545
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:53,000
Success so dialing in the system getting

546
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,919
choosing your Fields getting the riding

547
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,240
early um getting that rideing rate

548
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,919
correct that's what the most important

549
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,319
as ECT of having this work on your farm

550
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,600
um increases in Ry biomass tended to

551
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:08,000
decrease weed biomass if Ry biomass

552
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,719
increased soybean yield increased and

553
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,119
the soybean yield was strongly

554
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,200
correlated to weed biomass um and this

555
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,000
we see in the tilled system as well if

556
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,759
we don't get our weed management dialed

557
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,519
in that's when our geals are going to

558
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,319
suffer weed biomass was dominated by a

559
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,519
few species so these are species that we

560
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,399
struggle with in the Upper Midwest giant

561
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,679
rag weed giant fox tail um that's been a

562
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,080
really persistent issue in recent years

563
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,880
for a lot of grain Farmers as well as

564
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:41,639
yellil PL set up um really keyed in this

565
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,840
system to make it work um soybean

566
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,200
emergence is a challenge with increasing

567
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,079
Ry biomass we need that Ry biomass to

568
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,319
get the weed suppression does make

569
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,678
planting a

570
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,278
challenge so this is what we might see

571
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,000
if we PR first and don't have a plum set

572
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:58,519
up we have seeds that are resting on

573
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,880
that Ry bio mass and those seeds are

574
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,000
going to not germinate and contribute to

575
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,840
those stands so some setup

576
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,960
considerations if you're going to do

577
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,839
this um want to have the ability to cut

578
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,079
and navigate through the Rye residue to

579
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,399
open the furrow and reduce that hair

580
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,359
pinning where that um Rye is essentially

581
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
just put pushed into the planum row have

582
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,278
sufficient down pressure to push through

583
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,440
the M layer and place seed in the probia

584
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,720
depth and we want to have the ability to

585
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,440
to close us throw so we've done a lot of

586
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,240
research with a engineer Ryan luck and

587
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,399
see how we can overcome these issues so

588
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,278
looked at different um down pressures

589
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,599
different seaing rates still on a little

590
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,038
bit on the low side but a range of

591
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,639
seating rates as well as different Cults

592
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:47,240
and buring wheels and from what we've

593
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,480
seen um how that translates into yield

594
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,960
again to remind you if there's different

595
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,399
letters following values it means that

596
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,880
there uh statistically significantly

597
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,439
different um so that we can have

598
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,679
confidence that yes these treatments are

599
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,519
uh having effect on what we're measuring

600
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,038
and what we saw was that again when

601
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,639
we're looking at what to do with the

602
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,319
soybean planting phase to make this work

603
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,360
bumping up your seeding rates will um

604
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,720
translate into higher yields a down

605
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,158
pressure we did see a numerical

606
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,960
difference but not a significant

607
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,159
difference between the down pressures um

608
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,278
and as well as filter versus no filter

609
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,240
in this study um as been as closing whe

610
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,440
as well so the higher seaing rate is

611
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,519
improving plant stand and grain yield

612
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,960
higher down pressure and colding use

613
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,918
seem to um improve this plant stand but

614
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,278
that didn't translate into

615
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,159
yield um some relationship between

616
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,599
soybean emerges and grain yield from our

617
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,880
research stations um the research

618
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,839
stations uh at Arlington research

619
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,480
station in Arlington we can get really

620
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:57,519
high wi bi Ms um and that is

621
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,200
um it's it's a definitely a challenge in

622
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,558
terms of getting the soybean established

623
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,159
so soyum convergence translated into

624
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,240
brain yield Within These locations R

625
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,399
biomasses exceeding 10,000 pounds per

626
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,720
acre had lower sood emergence stronger

627
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,278
relationship to grain yield so this

628
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,720
indicates potentially that the yield Gap

629
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,480
could be overcome by

630
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,759
Emer so this pter style matter this is

631
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,679
some of the research we were doing with

632
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:28,359
uh Dr lock looking at what the waviness

633
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,840
how that W SE placement soing um plant

634
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,639
down so looked at several different

635
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:37,359
pters straight versus Ripple versus 13

636
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,480
wave versus eight wve versus no fter um

637
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,158
and what we found was that the results

638
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,798
differed per year so having U the

639
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,919
environmental conditions um that's going

640
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,359
to affect the degree of difference you

641
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:54,919
see with these different fers uh in um

642
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:57,199
2023 versus 224 you can see 2023 was an

643
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,440
extremely dry year versus last year we

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,480
had more steady rainfall particularly

645
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,399
early in the

646
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,599
season what we did find overall though

647
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,158
was that in with the planting set

648
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,079
planter set up in this system using

649
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:14,559
Straight cters um was was beneficial in

650
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:17,678
terms of being able to get um a good c

651
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,240
contact and plant stand um and that hair

652
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,080
pitting was significantly reduced so

653
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,679
setting up your plant of these systems

654
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
using Straight Edge cters is beneficial

655
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,919
we also found that the straight edge

656
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,240
culturs were beneficial in terms of um

657
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,679
uh having um reduced we pressure within

658
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,120
that Landing row so strage cultures have

659
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,080
several benefits with respect to the

660
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,239
system and how this translates into

661
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,798
brain yield um we did not see a

662
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,519
difference in terms of brain yield um

663
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,639
but in terms of again the weak

664
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,359
suppression and the

665
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,559
stand so I'm going to turn now for the

666
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,359
rest of my um talk and talk about some

667
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,720
of the research with reduced kill core

668
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,719
whereas and again we saw this translated

669
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,640
into the with the um on Farm study we

670
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,679
did organic no till soybeans is

671
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,840
definitely a system that can work if

672
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,038
you're planning how to plant this the

673
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:16,079
the ride how do you design a rotation

674
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:19,599
getting the planter set up um dialed in

675
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:22,240
organic noil soybeans are a viable and

676
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,240
profitable system for GRE Farmers

677
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,519
organic produced tot corn is something

678
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
that um I would say is not quite ready

679
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,120
for prime time at this point there's a

680
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,360
lot of exciting research a lot of

681
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,959
exciting promise and we're hearing more

682
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:37,319
stories of farmers that are seeing some

683
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,360
degree of success um if anyone would

684
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,439
want to try organic noil corn I would

685
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,158
recommend doing it on a very very small

686
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
scale just see how it works on your farm

687
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,440
two to 10 acres this is absolutely not

688
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,038
something that would do over a

689
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,679
significant number of Acres uh we've

690
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,640
tried a couple different approaches to

691
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,720
organic noil corn um roller crimping and

692
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,080
a living M system so roll pring more

693
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,079
mirroring what we're doing with the

694
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,960
soybeans using a winter annual cover CR

695
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:07,278
planted in the fall and then terminating

696
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,519
that mechanically in the spring living

697
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,960
mold systems um looking into using a

698
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:16,319
legume whether it be bread Clover other

699
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,600
clovers around F and using different

700
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,359
ways of suppressing that living mulch

701
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,240
that that um leg you that's been planted

702
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,038
um previous year or previous years

703
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,599
before the POR phase um and uh

704
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,480
essentially manage ing um that mulch to

705
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,199
limit competition with the

706
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,440
corn so in the roller G system we're

707
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,120
typically using R and VCH both winter

708
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,080
annuals um the benefits um these systems

709
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:48,119
tend to be more weed suppressive so we

710
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:50,240
get um more of that weed control aspect

711
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,918
of the system that we're looking for the

712
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,000
cover crop terminates so we can

713
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,519
mechanically terminate this and will

714
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,679
stay as a killed mulch so there's no

715
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,960
competition with nutrients and water

716
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,440
while the soy beans are growing a vet if

717
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,399
we can over winter vet consistently get

718
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
the bounts we need ve can supply a

719
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,278
significant amount of nitrogen to the

720
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,600
system which is a limiting factor in

721
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:17,319
terms of cor productivity Within These

722
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,759
noell systems um and higher yield

723
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:21,879
potential so far um as evidenced in a

724
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,919
research trial so it's it's a bit more

725
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,240
consistent in terms of the performance

726
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:31,880
of the syone um risks they do require a

727
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:35,558
later plan dat of the Corn um Ry can be

728
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,600
a a reservoir for um or a host for army

729
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:40,639
worms so there's more insect pressure

730
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:44,119
Within These systems um hardiness of veg

731
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,240
seed uh so that seed can have um

732
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,839
persistence across multiple Seasons so

733
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,880
it doesn't all germinate the first year

734
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,720
of planting and if there's Escapes in

735
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,840
terms of the V seed that can be

736
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,319
persistent in subsequent phas of the

737
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,439
prop ration and whereas the V can

738
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,158
produce a lot of nitrogen it's not

739
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,000
necessarily available when the corn

740
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,480
needs it so that can be a challenge as

741
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
well um the living M system uh planting

742
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,720
dates are not as dependent so

743
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,120
potentially because we're not waiting

744
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,319
for a stage of crop maturity for

745
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,879
mechanical termination so flowering for

746
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,398
both um Andis for rye as well as a

747
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,919
flowering early qus at for vet we can

748
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:26,479
theoretically come in as early as early

749
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,559
May and plant into these living Mo

750
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,480
systems are is less of a concern our is

751
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:36,480
not as attracted to legumes as it is to

752
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,880
grasses um less hard seediness uh have

753
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,159
that as concerned of persistence into

754
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,120
subsequent phases and an opportunity to

755
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
utilize that cover crop as of forage so

756
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,678
in our Dairy systems this could be a

757
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,839
very attractive option as a way to raise

758
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,960
or develop alternative forages or even

759
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:57,000
come in after not f stand risks um there

760
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,880
a lot more competition in these symptoms

761
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,759
because that are prods acely growing um

762
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,600
not as much contribution because that

763
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,278
nitrogen that's being fixed by the legum

764
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:10,079
is being used by the legum itself more

765
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,919
variability in yield um and inro control

766
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,480
can be an

767
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,639
issue uh some of the yields that we've

768
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,079
seen so we've been trying these from uh

769
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:22,759
less years

770
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:26,199
than so we have a good five or six years

771
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:29,960
under our B systems some of the light of

772
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,600
be we used um r Clover and aala and

773
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,720
yellow Blossom Sweet Clover so this is

774
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:36,959
where um there's promise but there's

775
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,159
still work to be done so if you see the

776
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,038
yield on that y AIS um you can have

777
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,760
yields as low as 50 bu in AC but in some

778
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:49,879
years in some systems we can see yields

779
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:52,720
reaching 150 and we've even gotten

780
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,480
closer to 180 in some of these systems

781
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,319
so in certain spots in the field so

782
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,240
there is evidence that there's potential

783
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,519
to these systems we can understand how

784
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,120
to dial it in what we need in terms of

785
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,120
reducing competition and management I

786
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:11,038
still hold that there is a way to to

787
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:13,319
utilize these systems to reduce form the

788
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,960
roller Qui systems um kind of see that

789
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:19,599
similar variability in Yi r v next we

790
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,319
can see yields of porn anywhere from

791
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,519
about 60 bu an acre up to 150 and even a

792
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,558
little bit higher if we're using just

793
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,359
straight hairy Veges the RO

794
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,638
so is this ready for on Farm adoption

795
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,558
not sure but really looking forward to

796
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:38,038
continuing this research in partnership

797
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:42,599
with farmers and cover crop breeders to

798
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:45,000
see how can we make that yield of 150 to

799
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,038
180 um so some of our experiments I know

800
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm getting very very close to time um

801
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:50,960
looking at comparing different

802
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,599
management tools and management

803
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,679
intensities of the cover CRS um so a

804
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,678
baseline uh using a free man applic

805
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,960
planting red clover in mid August um we

806
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,639
are doing different ways of kind of

807
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,559
strip tilling or modified strip toing so

808
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,199
Trying to minimize competition within

809
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,279
the planting Road form and getting good

810
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,398
stand establishment and one of the

811
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,519
things in the system that I think we can

812
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:20,000
also look at more closely is the

813
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,239
genetics I think genetics adaptation

814
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,800
genetics to these systems are going to

815
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,398
be key I want to you know just have that

816
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,679
point out that with that 150 bu and acre

817
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,519
yield we using very very short season

818
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,519
varieties of porn so maybe it's not

819
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,440
surprising that yield potential is less

820
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,079
um for in season management looking at

821
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,119
fertility applications at planting

822
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,800
making sure there's adequate nitrogen

823
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,760
and then some management of cover prop

824
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,240
uh so different tools we're using under

825
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,040
Cutters to make those rows um different

826
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,759
ways suppressing through flame weeding

827
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,519
roller pring High cultivation so um just

828
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,720
looking at some yield of these systems

829
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,719
undercutting looking at strip tilling or

830
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,480
clearing a planting Ro for the corn I

831
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,078
think that's going to be key these uh

832
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,559
yields are in B per hect there but you

833
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,039
can see with the um undercutting we do

834
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,920
see a significantly higher yield um

835
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,960
plane meeting um we did see a trend

836
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,159
towards um higher yields with the plane

837
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,639
weeding as well um that we supression

838
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:27,319
and looking at um Indo ging high res

839
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,129
cultivation um seeing a less of a um

840
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,359
impact those

841
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,160
[Music]

842
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:37,199
tools um but we did see a Trends towards

843
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:39,960
lower plant P cultivation so risk of

844
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,239
impacting the stand there um this is

845
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,679
some newer research we've done I'll wrap

846
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:49,439
up with this um using a forage Harvester

847
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:51,759
to manage alala um and using some other

848
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,318
strip tillage tools as well as the in

849
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,680
mower so crop management here R Clover

850
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:02,279
seeded in August um we do some Harvest

851
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,639
utilizing that um as a as a crop um as

852
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,519
well as a living mulch strip tilling in

853
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:09,400
late May planing that short season corn

854
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,920
doing some inner row mowing to help with

855
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,960
mitigated competition um at a couple

856
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,838
different stages V2 and4 so what we're

857
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,358
finding here um is that using some of

858
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,639
these um competition mitigation tools uh

859
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,119
we are seeing some benefit particular

860
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,358
IND um looking at what the potential

861
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,318
nitrogen competition is or an uptake of

862
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,679
the porn so it does look like if we can

863
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,199
mitigate some of that competition it

864
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:38,118
could be valuable um both within the red

865
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:40,480
clover and Al ala systems um looking at

866
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,240
cord yields so this is where um

867
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,800
particularly um you know looking at the

868
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,358
in R mower as a way to um help improve

869
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,240
some of the corn yields by mitigating

870
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,920
that competition so yields here not

871
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,199
great um but we are seeing some impacts

872
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,440
on management and definitely some

873
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:00,838
promising results terms of getting the

874
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,838
yields that that would be considered um

875
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,759
acceptable so um just want to thank the

876
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,000
organizers of the event thank you all

877
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,680
for uh coming to our event want to point

878
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,039
out our website we have a great website

879
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,440
with a lot of tools um lots of past

880
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:18,759
videos lots of different resources case

881
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,440
studies um we also have a link to a list

882
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,200
serve that we have that facilitates

883
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,000
farmer to Farmer communication um just

884
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,239
again a huge thank you to Ben Brock

885
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,960
Miller putting together um this slide

886
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,919
said and to just the the Silva and Ryan

887
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,880
lab team members in general for all

888
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,760
their work with u developing these

889
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,400
research This research over the last

890
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,640
several decades so thank you uh question

891
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,358
in the back there yes what's

892
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:46,318
theing when you plant do this standing

893
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,799
right yeah so planting it's the so with

894
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,960
the standing rise system there's two

895
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,119
ways that farmers are doing it one is

896
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,119
essentially planting into the standing

897
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,240
Ry at anesis and crimping right over it

898
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,760
so it's done on the same day or within

899
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,519
24 hours um it's just planting into the

900
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,119
standing ride to get better seed disil

901
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,719
contact in some of our research that we

902
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,880
did with trying to um boost the uh

903
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,519
earliness of the soybean planting date

904
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,119
what we're typically targeting in that

905
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:20,838
system is is getting the soybeans uh

906
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,800
planted and then to um about the um the

907
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:25,199
the the first true Lea stage so about

908
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,599
the V1 so we don't want to plant in

909
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,960
there too early so we're usually coming

910
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,960
in um around May 15th which is is

911
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,760
usually around the boot stage of Ry um

912
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,000
and we don't crimp right away so we'll

913
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,400
go into the standing Rye plant that boot

914
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,519
stage um that rye will continue to

915
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,599
mature the soybeans will come up in that

916
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:47,199
standing rye and then will roll over the

917
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,920
soybeans at that that early stage of

918
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:53,118
maturity if we push it too much earlier

919
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,480
into May the soybeans um they're kind of

920
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
star for sunlight under that rye canopy

921
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,358
and they can get really leggy and

922
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,000
damaged but if we do it about two weeks

923
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:05,400
before an thesis um we do see some stand

924
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,039
loss uh but we have had years where

925
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,559
where that is advantageous in terms of

926
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,519
the final yield um Farmers have had

927
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,078
mixed success we've had mixed success I

928
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,079
don't necessarily see enough benefit of

929
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
that earlier planting date and criming

930
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,440
over the soybeans to justify that I

931
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,959
think it's a lower risk system to just

932
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,838
plant it and and crimp it in a thesis

933
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,280
but it isn't it is an

934
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,279
option is that curiosity what is your

935
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,240
plan rate on your soybeans that you ran

936
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,960
for these tests here and what was the

937
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:38,000
size of the soybeans yes that's the size

938
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,679
of the soyan I am not sure um we're

939
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,760
going at a lower seaing rate that I

940
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,358
think is ideal particularly with some of

941
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,680
the research that's been done at Cornell

942
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:49,159
University so in these trials we're

943
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,799
we're usually I think at about 225 but I

944
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,440
think bumping it up and Matt can give

945
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,240
his opinion to 240 is probably a sound

946
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,119
of recommendation 225 is already much

947
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,838
better than um what's recommended in

948
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,119
conventional production I think you know

949
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,960
we've seen uh that yeah higher rates do

950
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,920
pay but yeah 225 to 240 is kind of where

951
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,800
we're seeing our uh the maximum or the

952
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,519
uh greatest economic return then yeah

953
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,039
we're usually like at a 1.6 1.8 maturity

954
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:15,358
group but I'm not sure what the seed

955
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,318
that's like really but that's I think

956
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:18,880
variety trialing these systems and

957
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:21,639
understanding the impacts of seed size

958
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,640
and canopy and um other factors is

959
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,559
something we haven't touched upon yet

960
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,920
thank

961
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,559
you was there any assessments on on the

962
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,318
Cosmetic nature of the soybeans they're

963
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,519
suitable for their Island Market I have

964
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:37,838
not heard and in CL might have more

965
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,599
experience there I have not heard issues

966
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,639
with well you sorry Peter take me a

967
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,318
while to connect there we haven't seen

968
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,239
an issue um we haven't seen an issue

969
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,440
with staining but good point sorry for

970
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,399
that just it took me a while to CLI

971
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,280
there so you've had seen you guys have

972
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,280
seen issues with uh yeah okay

973
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,359
this has been a production of Cornell

974
