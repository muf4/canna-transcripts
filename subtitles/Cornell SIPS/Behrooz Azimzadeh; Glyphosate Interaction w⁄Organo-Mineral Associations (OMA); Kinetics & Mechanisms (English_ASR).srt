1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,280
University thank you for the detail

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,960
introduction amazing and first of all I

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,160
need to say that thank you for attending

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,760
that's it's great to have you as

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,160
audiences and I'm excited to present my

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,118
board my book is about life and I'm

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,599
seeing I'm looking at G interaction

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,399
right organ

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
Association and focusing on kinetics and

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,079
mechanisms this is what we know about

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,159
herbici application in United States

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,878
glyos is most heavily

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,359
applied between all those herbicides to

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,960
kill

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,719
bits and over years it's a more popular

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,079
became more popular and farmer loves

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,239
this heresite and Dally if you look this

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,439
map

20
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:11,000
here so this is the Mississippi Basin

21
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:14,079
it's Al and Central Valley Columbia

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,159
River and Washington State those are

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,039
planes which heavily farmed and heavily

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,320
used for

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,840
herbicide herbicide or you can know as a

26
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:30,599
this trademark round up it's

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,840
so became a little bit uh

28
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,438
controversial in terms of environmental

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,759
toxicity and occurence we can find

30
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,199
everywhere in soil water even air and

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,599
also can be accummulated in

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Plants however it's not cionic it's

33
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,599
defined by

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,240
EPA in terms of like a usage that's a

35
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,919
thing we are thinking we should more pay

36
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,519
attention about that I'm showing here

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,359
the most uh like a the main processes of

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:07,399
like in envir compartment how it moves

39
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:11,000
around after spray it can be by

40
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,318
accumul or it can be degradated by U

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,519
light or it can enter into water sorry

42
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:20,878
into soil or water and interact with

43
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,920
minerals specifically organ organ

44
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,280
mineral

45
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,280
associations excuse

46
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:33,959
me I'm interested to

47
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:37,759
learn about how it retain and be

48
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:43,280
released or transforms and those

49
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:45,199
are mineral and organ Association a

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,199
biotically and

51
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,919
also this really important to know how

52
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:55,199
this byproducts can be generated after

53
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,238
transformation because we seea Amal

54
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,039
phosphoric acid which is one of this by

55
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,319
product it can be uptaken by plant much

56
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,400
more than

57
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:08,839
glyphosate and also it's has the same

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,840
toxicity impact on

59
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,000
cells this is a general understanding or

60
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,759
general figure of my

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,639
visitation orgam Association

62
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:26,759
concentration diminishes as you go down

63
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,919
profile and after spray obviously it's

64
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,518
going to interact with organ Association

65
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,719
on top

66
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,759
in terms of interaction and type of

67
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,639
organ Association it can go into the

68
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,438
retention process or it can be

69
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,199
transformed so mag oxide is very well

70
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:46,919
known for transformation or oxidation of

71
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,919
glyphosate so this is a candidate for

72
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,798
doing that study and iron oxide is

73
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,958
selectively they selectively absorb

74
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,400
organ Organics and form organ

75
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,479
Association so it's a good

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,239
representative to pick as organ

77
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,238
Association to see glyphosate

78
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,199
retention at

79
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,079
one in act one or section

80
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:18,918
one is a kind of in section for my

81
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,240
dissertation and that's about theability

82
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,478
of particles in soil organ Association

83
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,478
forms and obviously can change

84
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,399
theability of that in the other like

85
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,120
language we call them how it can be more

86
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,799
hydrophobic or

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,840
hydrophilic if we can measure it is

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,680
measuring Water contact angle if the

89
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:45,119
contact angle is about 90 de it's going

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,319
to be more hydrophobic and below that is

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
hydrophilic

92
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,120
surface so

93
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,360
gote has a hydrophilic surface and

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,240
I I picked Diamond because we have

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,280
diamond plate and that's a hydrophobic

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,199
surface and can be used as a model to

97
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,879
study how organ Association formation

98
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,800
can change this hydrophobicity of the

99
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:15,079
philicity on both

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,199
surfaces so for organic or dissolve

101
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,639
organic matter I picked polysaccharide

102
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,199
polysaccharide can be find in soil and

103
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,319
it comes from plant cell wall and also

104
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
microbial

105
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,600
necromass and they accumulate at the

106
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,680
surface of minerals specifically a metal

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,039
oxides I this

108
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,600
interesting uh so now I have a model

109
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:43,918
system I can see that more

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,000
fundamentally instead of using like a

111
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,000
the extraction of

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,319
D on this graph

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,840
here uh first of all I use Inc ATR

114
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,720
spectroscopy is a technique to see

115
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:04,439
absorption at the surface of mineral if

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,560
you have mineral you can introduce your

117
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,439
organic your uh your target sorbent they

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,598
going to absorb and you're going to see

119
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,360
some

120
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,439
PS they come different frequency and

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,919
those frequency is related to different

122
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:23,199
bondings in in each

123
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:26,399
molecule at the surface of theide we see

124
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,759
absorption of poy is much more than

125
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,839
Diamond that because po itself is

126
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,840
hydrophilic and hydrophilic loves

127
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,439
hydrophilic it ter kinetic with

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,759
increasing surface loading or pide we

129
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,240
notice it's gets

130
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,720
slower and we have more

131
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
absorption and subsequently when we have

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,400
dsorption

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,000
phase some of those absorbed can be

134
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,839
disorb if it's much we have more

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,279
absorption there's more chance for

136
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,839
dsorption but in lower is a lower

137
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,758
absorption rate we have less absorption

138
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,198
the other way to translate that looking

139
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,800
at isoterm is absorption dsorption is

140
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,879
also shows this uh loading at different

141
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,918
St like a phase absorption and so

142
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,720
dsorption

143
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:24,758
this is a a similar set data set for

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Diamond so we have less absorption

145
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,800
compared to goite kinetically much much

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,120
faster

147
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
and during

148
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,478
absorption I can say most of them are

149
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,918
disorb and some of them are still at

150
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,159
surface and this is you can see an ISO

151
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,159
as

152
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,520
well this is really important to know

153
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,000
first how much stuff you have how does

154
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,560
it look like the loading uh rate and

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,478
capacity what I did next I was

156
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,280
interested to see the hydrophobicity and

157
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,279
ficity I use water contact angle

158
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:04,279
measurement uh

159
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:08,359
met to measure what what angle we

160
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:12,758
increasing surface loading here we

161
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,038
notice on both surface idop phobicity

162
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,759
idop phobicity increases since we have

163
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,759
higher contact

164
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,840
angle that was interesting but it

165
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,240
doesn't matter what surface you start

166
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,318
but you load more more more surface

167
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,840
become more

168
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,158
hydrophobe and this this picture here

169
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,559
it's not obvious actually maybe that

170
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,718
that screen is much better the outline

171
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,838
here this space is loaded by po this a

172
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,159
Tage of poy

173
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,519
Association that's giving you a little B

174
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:52,519
visual result how Z look like in

175
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:55,200
summary and also more data we have here

176
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,560
in terms of functional interaction of

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,480
functionality on P private

178
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,679
surface what you learned

179
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,839
in interfacial sequence for those

180
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,599
functional groups you can see functional

181
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,519
groups here this is po structure par

182
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,800
groups Mi groups and M groups and this

183
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,799
is

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,440
backbone if if it's the surface Diamond

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,000
hydrophobic

186
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,200
surface backbone which is a more

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
hydrophobic surface hydrophobic

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,040
component it start to show up at the

189
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,000
surface but loading more and

190
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,559
more we we started to see am and

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
carboxilic functionalities those are

192
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,559
more

193
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,879
hydrophilic and but at the end it's

194
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,719
wrapped up by a metaler functional group

195
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:47,639
which is

196
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,639
hydrophobic more hydrophobic than other

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,120
functionalities the same we have we have

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,039
the same Trend like in terms of how this

199
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,560
hydropic hydrophilic functional

200
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:04,159
accumulated surface and go side at the

201
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,559
end of the the loading ultimate loading

202
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,439
we saw again luster and the surface

203
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:13,599
again became hydrop the top here at the

204
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,200
most surfaces this is really important

205
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,440
to know how much organic

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,640
matter can change the hydrophobicity

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,000
ority and how this going to impact a

208
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,078
contam the transfer of contaminants when

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,320
they going to

210
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,319
interact act two

211
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:38,879
in act two so I introduced lios in the

212
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,759
system and I

213
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,838
found that was a question actually the

214
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:49,039
question was how this organ complexation

215
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,480
now can change glyos retention or if

216
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,319
there's any potential for release with

217
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,320
they abor or

218
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,240
not this is a bad uh study dat I'm

219
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,838
showing here the first look at this uh

220
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,680
plot at the left

221
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,680
typ with think this red line showing

222
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:15,799
absorption during showing absorption of

223
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:19,239
glyphosate with increasing absor loading

224
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,958
we found with loading more poy absor

225
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,879
lessly absorb less and after but we had

226
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:30,000
aborption this is the Blue Line we had

227
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,519
some disorb but the same trend

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,759
with the same

229
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,120
Trend if you look after specific point

230
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,958
with loading with loading more poy here

231
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,240
and here for absortion absorption we had

232
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:47,439
a little bit increase for glyos

233
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,039
absorption uh it's more feable it looks

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,279
to have more glyphosate even we have a

235
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:56,078
lot of polysaccharide at the

236
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,799
surface what I did I said maybe it's

237
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,559
about like a charge we can look at the

238
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,319
charge of the surface because

239
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,518
electrostatically we are interacting

240
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:09,120
each other I measured the potential of

241
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:12,560
those uh samples I found with increasing

242
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,679
this uh red sorry this green line here

243
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,638
with increasing loading we have are

244
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:21,679
generating more negative charge

245
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:25,839
glycosite itself is z ion but in total

246
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:29,919
one one negative one so that means we

247
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,519
should have less absorption and that's

248
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:37,039
which is about this part so what about

249
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,399
this part when we have more loading when

250
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,958
we have more loading it looks when we

251
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,559
have we add glyphosate in this are the

252
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:48,719
red dots does it the potential became a

253
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:53,479
little bit more positive still negative

254
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,000
but less u in terms of the pulsive Force

255
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,800
it's less the

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,198
pulsive sorry repulsive and we can have

257
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,198
more more interaction attractive

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,000
interaction fundamentally I have one

259
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:13,599
more question what's happening like what

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,600
do we see this increase for charge so I

261
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,159
looked a little bit in detail using STD

262
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,920
NMR uh technique STD NMR technique is a

263
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:26,559
very good technique to study H gas

264
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,479
complexation between protein and small

265
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,599
legans

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,199
this is the combination of glyphosate

267
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,159
and polysaccharide we had a com we had a

268
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:41,679
stample this is just glyphosate only we

269
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:46,600
found when we have pick of glyphosate in

270
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:50,599
this sample when we have Spectra that

271
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,959
actually shows we have noncovalent

272
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,040
interaction via hydr bonding between

273
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,359
polysaccharides and glyphosate they can

274
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,120
attract each other through hydrob

275
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,919
bonding and hydrob bonding is very good

276
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,720
sort of interaction to stabilize a to

277
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:10,120
stabilize the complex so the complex can

278
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,320
immobilize easily at the surface so we

279
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,320
have this increase

280
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,758
now

281
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:23,799
oh

282
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:27,360
sorry that was a bch of study now I want

283
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,679
to see more about glyos it itself and

284
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,399
its bonding how the molecule interact at

285
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,039
the

286
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,759
surface and how how those

287
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,919
functionalities in glyos we have glyos

288
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,360
here it has phosphinate group group and

289
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:47,319
carboxilic acid group I want to see how

290
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,199
it interacting at the surface of Po poy

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,639
go Association and also

292
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:57,838
go so at the right hand side we are

293
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,560
looking at P band which is related to

294
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,800
this interaction chemisorption of

295
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,439
glyphosate and at the right hand side

296
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:09,719
you have carox

297
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,839
AL C this peak that shows this part the

298
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,240
green part of the

299
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,199
glyos and I looked at Peak area versus

300
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,240
time this is a thing you can figure out

301
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,838
how much stuff you have and how change

302
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,839
it as a function of

303
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,720
time so this is for po band and this is

304
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,880
for Caro I mean car coo band so third

305
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,440
thing we can find so this is faster

306
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:39,318
carox Ian functionality is interacting

307
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,759
faster and but this this phosphonate is

308
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:45,240
not interacting at the same rate in

309
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,000
another thing with increasing PS loading

310
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,799
this way I'm loading

311
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,440
more we we decrease both functionalities

312
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,439
and that's equivalent to less

313
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,920
absorption there the reason to have two

314
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:06,399
different rates for one molecule is

315
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,719
actually about interfacial species we

316
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,958
don't have only one type of Kos at the

317
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,959
surface we have multiple different types

318
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:18,039
and those are in different locations and

319
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,039
in total in general we see different

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,480
rates oh one thing I to mention that

321
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,720
okay and if you look the uh the type of

322
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,920
binding this is by dented binding we

323
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,560
have two oxygen

324
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:37,000
and connected to two

325
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:39,518
iron atom and here only we have one hand

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,198
which is a or one bonding we call the

327
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,159
monodendate so when when we have

328
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:47,078
polysaccharide mon monate bonding is

329
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,240
moreable and that's really important

330
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,439
because bented is much stronger than b

331
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,879
monodentate and that means there's a

332
00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:02,839
chance that glyphosate can be released

333
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:02,838
from po Association versus uh goti be

334
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:12,838
goti again I like to think more in

335
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:15,959
detail and I looked the carox I mean

336
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:20,399
versus carox Acid versus

337
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,439
aming so I did I deconstructed the Peaks

338
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,400
and this is the deconvolution analysis I

339
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,839
found if I look the

340
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,200
retained if I look the contribution of

341
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,000
this function

342
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,880
ities I can find how much they are

343
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,319
important in the interaction during

344
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,039
absorption and absorption what we found

345
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,639
during absorption with increasing poy

346
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,879
loading ammonium this functionality here

347
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,679
this functional

348
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,919
group have more getting more

349
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,480
contribution in the interaction the

350
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
retention of

351
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,919
glyphosate and that's a really uh

352
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,840
interesting for me and it makes sense

353
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,640
actually actually am mean is positively

354
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:05,519
charged so electrostatically they can

355
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,640
interact more with the negative charge

356
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:12,079
uh components in

357
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,280
polysaccharide and it makes a tertiary

358
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,519
complex polysaccharide

359
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,519
glyphosate uh iron

360
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,960
oxide and this is we have a

361
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,000
chemisorption from the one side and we

362
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,400
have a hydrogen bonding from the other

363
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,159
side so this wayos can be stabilized at

364
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,480
the surface and then maybe it can have

365
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,840
delayed release when there's uh when you

366
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,720
have more precipitation in offseason

367
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,720
during fall or

368
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,639
winter in

369
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,038
summary did you know sorry I know now

370
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,600
you know

371
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:58,279
whyos dances on J floor it's more

372
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:02,119
mobile looks so glyphosate retained to

373
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,519
less sent uh we can find I'm just

374
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,678
counting so just comparing those

375
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,158
Peaks and po go to Association that

376
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,880
means we're going to have greater

377
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,679
transport of g into water and po

378
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,280
Association promotes more monent dat

379
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,960
bind dat and Which is less strong and

380
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,678
the retain lifeo that's the kind of uh

381
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,319
interpretation from those data that says

382
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,320
that could be possible to have a delayed

383
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,839
Ling act

384
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,440
three in act

385
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,359
three I have a different

386
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,360
question in this question I'm looking

387
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:50,839
at how low molecular weight this time

388
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,240
poy is high molecular weight compound in

389
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,639
soil but I wanted to know how low

390
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,359
molecular weight disol organic matter

391
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,600
can interact with glyphosate

392
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:06,359
and how it changes their absorption and

393
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:11,678
retention so I made a binary system this

394
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,678
time I mix them together and let them to

395
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,399
absorb so for low modly weight do I'm

396
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,919
using

397
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,919
this peptide it has 19 Amin acids as a

398
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,919
model

399
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:35,480
PTI so before starting study absorption

400
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,599
on go type I was interested to know is

401
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,400
there any interaction in solution itself

402
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:44,279
this low moleular we and GL can interact

403
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,080
so I use two different techniques ir and

404
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:51,399
NMR so in ir and at the right the left

405
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:54,599
hand side this spectrum showing

406
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,360
glyphosate plus peptide

407
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,480
sample if you compare the lines the dash

408
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,918
Lin

409
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,360
which is from blos pepti you can see

410
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,000
this is the summation of those Spectrum

411
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:12,519
with no shifts no shifts for frequencies

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,880
and no shifts actually for brening or

413
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,798
shortening of the sh of bands and that

414
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,799
means there's no interaction we test it

415
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,400
again with a different technique and we

416
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:27,038
look at those amino acids this

417
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,519
time this is the NMR

418
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:35,759
toxy for P sample which is a do of black

419
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:39,798
regene and pepti plus gly sample are

420
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:42,599
showing the showed by Red regines if you

421
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:45,558
look those regines from peptide and

422
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,558
peptide plus glyphosine they're over lay

423
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:49,440
completely covering each other and

424
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,319
there's no differences they're not

425
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,320
moving around that means there's no

426
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,520
interaction what about surface what

427
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:01,519
about the

428
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,000
surface I looked at glyphosate peptide

429
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,639
absorption

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,319
spectra and to know how peptide can

431
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,880
change the absorption rate and capacity

432
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:17,319
and also how it changes its complexation

433
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,000
of the data shows here I looked at this

434
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:24,558
bonding here which is a f POF

435
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,400
bonding or can aborption of

436
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:32,000
glyphosate glyphosate itself is the sign

437
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,960
the this is the curve for lios so plus

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,839
peptide you can see dramatically dropped

439
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,278
it they have less absorption for peptide

440
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,359
they competing for surface and peptide

441
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,400
is winning this game peptide can sit

442
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,319
accy the surface

443
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,159
and

444
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:54,759
didn't I

445
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,400
didn't allow glyphosate to the

446
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,038
sorb another thing is about kinetic also

447
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,840
the kinetically

448
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:07,240
glyphosate absorption is

449
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:10,000
slower during the in a in a Solo System

450
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,759
but when we have peptide it's became

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,599
faster the reason is

452
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:19,798
chemisorption kinetically is a slow slow

453
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:23,480
reaction but alter complexation without

454
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:26,599
chemisorption is faster so that me

455
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,679
peptide is changing binding top not only

456
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:33,319
absorption capacity

457
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,600
also we found if there is any type of

458
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,678
chemisorption for glyphosate with

459
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,678
peptide it's more monen take form which

460
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,679
is a less strong

461
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:51,599
one the summary for that I can say

462
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:56,000
peptide glyos in the presence of

463
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,839
peptide decreases the absorption for

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,079
glyphosate and that means we going to

465
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:05,558
have more transport then you have low

466
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:09,000
moleular weight comp kind of sub and

467
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:12,678
plus glyphosate lios are not able to sit

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,599
and find someplace for it sit for itself

469
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:19,798
so it goes away and stay in water and

470
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:23,798
another things as I mentioned don't way

471
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:26,599
do like peptide promotes more more

472
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:29,440
dented and outer sphere complexation

473
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,719
those type of bonding are are very weak

474
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
bonding and also less

475
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,000
strong and in

476
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,879
general we found there's no

477
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,240
interaction in solution and at the

478
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,799
surface between glyphosate and peptide

479
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,000
that was another which is opposite

480
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:53,398
poyares P way they interact with each

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,278
other then you have high M weight

482
00:24:53,398 --> 00:25:00,278
compound but low M weight and glyphosate

483
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,599
P tract

484
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:04,839
the last

485
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,319
Act is about transformation of

486
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,319
glyos so I looked at absorption and

487
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,798
dsorption

488
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:16,038
now the question is how organ Min

489
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,038
Association impact transformation of

490
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,759
glyos blosic transformation I think I

491
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,720
mentioned this create a Amal phosphoric

492
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:30,519
acid which is toxic as same as

493
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:35,278
glyphosate or earli stage kind of celf

494
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:37,398
development in animals and plants and so

495
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:42,278
we should look we should

496
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:45,000
study fic acid more and look at that so

497
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:47,640
the Orin and this compound originates

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,038
from transformation so I wanted to know

499
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,399
how organ Association can uh change

500
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:57,240
generation of this product or

501
00:25:54,398 --> 00:26:00,879
transformation of

502
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,599
glyos so the model mineral is magese

503
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,840
oxide we have two magese oxide in this

504
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:12,439
system sorry uh berite and

505
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:15,079
Hite Mages oxide the differences is

506
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,640
they're having different catalytic

507
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:21,278
capability and the reason is having

508
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
different content of Manganese 34 or

509
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,359
different manganes uh different

510
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,959
oxidation States for

511
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:32,479
manganese bite have more

512
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,399
manganese 3 and four but Hite has more

513
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,360
manganese 2 and

514
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:42,278
three that means lower average oxidation

515
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,439
state lower Catal catalytic capability

516
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,359
or

517
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,360
oxidative transformation for

518
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,960
glyphosate on this is slide I'm showing

519
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:55,480
uh two interesting Pathways in terms of

520
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,519
my

521
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,159
study the pathway that create I'm

522
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,480
phosphoric acid or ampa and

523
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,919
glycine Glycine paway and the reason

524
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,960
there are we have two different molecule

525
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,919
because this cage a c and cage can be

526
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,519
happen in two different position and

527
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,880
then then can create two different

528
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,879
molecule and two different

529
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Pathways either is it ampa or

530
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,840
glycine two steps are really important

531
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,159
step for transformation the first step

532
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,158
is

533
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,880
complexation Gite absorbs and then we

534
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:40,360
have a single electron transfer reaction

535
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,480
electron jumps into the surface and then

536
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,319
we have a radical species and this

537
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,319
radical species start to

538
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,679
degradate gly is okay if you have G only

539
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:57,000
this

540
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,640
halfway we should be fine g g is safe

541
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,440
it's om acid

542
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,720
but the empa is not safe and also it

543
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,960
accumulates more imp plants so this

544
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,839
pathway is a bad pathway and this

545
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
pathway is a good

546
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,640
pathway again is there any interaction

547
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,480
between protean and glyphosate before

548
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,320
starting to see the interaction at the

549
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,759
surface protean is high moleular we

550
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:30,079
dissolve matter in soil

551
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:34,519
so I was expecting to see interaction

552
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:37,678
and I saw it SDR showed this interaction

553
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:42,759
and this time the interaction was much

554
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:45,798
uh Stronger the now now calent bonding

555
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:49,200
between glyos protein it looks shows

556
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:54,599
better signal for SDR the bigger signal

557
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,600
means a stronger non coent bonding

558
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,759
so let's talk about absorption first and

559
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,480
then we're going to talk about

560
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:07,038
transformation so the first step I said

561
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,519
is surface

562
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:15,679
complexation for this I use in2 ATR FD

563
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,319
spectroscopy since I have a very limited

564
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,798
surface on

565
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:24,398
ATR I'm able to see only detect glyos

566
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,839
absorption you have a lot of glyphosate

567
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,759
and Lim the surface the signal from

568
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:32,678
byproduct mole

569
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:35,000
is not is negligible and it's not uh

570
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,559
overlapping or interfering with the

571
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,159
glyphosate signal so I

572
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:45,558
can TRW some data based on what I'm see

573
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,320
and referring that to p and bonding this

574
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:51,519
bonding here is a bed bonding between

575
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,759
Mages oxide and

576
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:57,480
glyphosine on top we have bur side this

577
00:29:54,759 --> 00:30:00,759
panel and this panel has KN so I'm going

578
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,038
to talk about side first first two line

579
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:07,599
from top side top are showing P

580
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:11,679
experiment at pH 4.6 with up and with

581
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:14,519
BSA protein and the the next two which

582
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,600
are lower showing lower absorption they

583
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:22,558
are pH 7.2 so this is the first on first

584
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:24,759
result increasing pH decrease absorption

585
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,079
that makes sense glyos became more

586
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,798
negatively charged and surface also gets

587
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,000
more negatively charged because those

588
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:35,119
magnes oxide

589
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,960
having lower Z PC zero point of charge

590
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,158
and then the the pH is above that

591
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,120
surface became more negative and we have

592
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,919
more repulsive

593
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:49,398
Force what about

594
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:51,559
BSA BSA adding and comp to the

595
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,239
system decrease

596
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,440
absorption you have less absorption now

597
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,798
when we have the set surface it doesn't

598
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,919
matter which uh what

599
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:05,000
pH is that or even the surface we see

600
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,679
the same ter even for Hite and hus also

601
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,359
show this uh absor list absorption

602
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:15,120
capacity when we add BSA

603
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:19,558
in and also the same turn for

604
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:22,119
pH so BSA Association reduce the extent

605
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,839
and absorption rate for glyphosate on

606
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:29,599
both coated Mages oxides at higher pH I

607
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:33,278
said less capacity at soing capacity

608
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:35,519
that means so we going to have more into

609
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,519
the

610
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,880
water for

611
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,798
transformation I needed to extend the

612
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,278
surface so I wanted to measure

613
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:52,839
byproducts my Surface needed to be

614
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:56,319
bigger so I designed a new system a new

615
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:59,199
kind of experimental design so actually

616
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:02,798
I'm mimicking the the transport in po

617
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,600
water these are SW particles and also so

618
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,918
particles coated with manganese oxide or

619
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,439
iron oxide

620
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,759
Plus organic matter so this is what I

621
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,480
did I

622
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:20,278
made BSA magnes oxide chips protein is

623
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,200
loaded onto the magnes oxide here and

624
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:28,000
this this glass SL glass glass SL goes

625
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:31,200
into the a microf reactor then we ince

626
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,759
use glyos in as a function of time we

627
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,840
collect influence and we analyze for uh

628
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:42,440
for byproducts using lcms or other

629
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:42,439
photometric photometric

630
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:51,679
approach this is a closer view to the

631
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:54,558
bite and light chips so here on Top This

632
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:59,919
is a cross-section of that it shows how

633
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:03,398
thick is uh film The magn oxide and for

634
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,038
Hite for Brite is around 2 micrometer

635
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:10,558
and for Hite is 4.5

636
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:13,759
micrometer so they have different amount

637
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:17,200
of mang oxide at the surface

638
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:21,519
but the thing is very important is the

639
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,000
surface area internal surface area or

640
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,038
total catalic surface area we have

641
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,278
almost similar surface area now so

642
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,240
they're going to be

643
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:31,880
they're going to have fair condition in

644
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,839
terms of surface

645
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,159
area and these two are T images of those

646
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,158
cryst kind of

647
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,439
particles now we are looking at work

648
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,720
through curves from those uh from that

649
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,080
uh microfic

650
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,360
reactors when we have bide and then in

651
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,359
the next slide we're going to look at

652
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:02,439
Hite so I

653
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,558
or sort the result based on ph here at

654
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,039
the left hand side we have pH 4.6 at the

655
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:13,559
right hand side we have P

656
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:16,639
7.2 on the bottom and on bottom of the

657
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:20,639
panel we have bur side with BSA and on

658
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:24,200
top bur side alone no BSA it's is very

659
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,399
obvious like with increasing with uh at

660
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:30,918
greater pH transformation became less

661
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:35,239
you have less by products and so if you

662
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:39,519
compare at either either like a pH 4.6

663
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:42,638
or P ph7.2 when we have glyphosate sorry

664
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,918
when we have protean at the surface so

665
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,240
it diminishes the deration we have less

666
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,239
transformation for

667
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,159
glyphosate in terms of path phas I

668
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,519
calculated how much of transformation

669
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,680
related to a and how much is related to

670
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,960
glycine I measured since I have data

671
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:09,679
for ampa and

672
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,838
glycine at pH 4.6 it looks they are

673
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:17,039
going equally we have both Pathways and

674
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:22,119
they are almost equal rate increasing

675
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:24,960
pH it changes again now bline pathway

676
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,880
gets more dominated dominated now this

677
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,800
primly we can say goes this way around

678
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,320
70% and 30% that we have two numbers

679
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,440
here because of the with BSA and without

680
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:43,599
BSA uh with BSA port at the surface we

681
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,000
see more ampa uh as a

682
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:51,280
pathway that's a littleit change if it's

683
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,719
40 without BSA it became 46 here at p7

684
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,200
7.2 if it was 28 now became 32 so BSA

685
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:03,039
Association

686
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:06,799
Ina kind of change the pathway toward

687
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:10,358
amp but it still Li is

688
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,318
more exactly same Trend not exactly same

689
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:18,199
similar Trend observe the surface of

690
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:22,960
Hite with without DSA at to

691
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:25,399
pH and then here but the the ratio

692
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,720
between ample pathway and glum pathway

693
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,358
is not the same it looks

694
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:37,719
aite uh mediate more gling paths way 80%

695
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:40,400
at 4.6 and 86% at 7.2 and there's no

696
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:44,598
difference with with having or not

697
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,838
having a BSA they have exactly the same

698
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,400
ratio and one thing I didn't mention

699
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,639
that is about if there's any chance for

700
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,880
to go forther transformation for

701
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,199
byproducts the way you can say that

702
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,280
measuring ammonium and I detected

703
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:05,000
ammonium at the surface of asite but

704
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,079
burze shows couple per like a 2 to 5%

705
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,480
ammonium that means still B is more

706
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,160
catalytically active

707
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,079
to

708
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:20,799
serate one more step to get ammonium

709
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,800
phosphate carbon dioxide and

710
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:27,719
water so here I'm summarizing the

711
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:32,039
protein Association in bags

712
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:34,199
so it looks active site occupied by ber

713
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:36,440
by by BSA

714
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,598
protein then what's happening so it

715
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,480
limits the adsorption and subsequently

716
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,480
limits transformation

717
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,679
rates another thing we found from STD

718
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,000
andmr study there is organic organic

719
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,679
interaction so how it changes the system

720
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,800
we have organic organ interaction so

721
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,719
glyphosate has less chance to interact

722
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,480
with the surface and to be degradated so

723
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,639
it protects glyphosate from

724
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,480
fire so another thing this is

725
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,480
interesting this is studied by many

726
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,838
people and they found protein can

727
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,760
immobilize and reduce manganes when we

728
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,480
have reduced surface and that's another

729
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,880
another way to have less transformation

730
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,039
because catalic capity capability drops

731
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,880
then we have video surface instead of

732
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,880
having oxid

733
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:39,838
surface here I have

734
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,119
time this is the thing I'm proposing for

735
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:47,279
surface passivation of manganes

736
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:50,680
oxide so I measured pH and also

737
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,000
dissolved manganese soluble manganese in

738
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:56,440
influence to learn how it changes like

739
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
because when we have glyphosate

740
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,200
transformation we have a electron uh

741
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,838
transfer from glyphosate to surface and

742
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,159
surface became

743
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,838
reduced that means magnes oxide became

744
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,318
transformed so we have not the same

745
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:14,960
surface the surface changes when we have

746
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,358
more

747
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,039
transformation and the transformation

748
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:23,119
causes higher pH that means we going to

749
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,838
have high pH in solution that diminishes

750
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,039
the

751
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:30,719
transformation we have more soluble

752
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:33,039
magang in solution that means Ru surface

753
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:36,480
again it decreases

754
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:39,800
transformation another thing we have

755
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,280
glyphosate glyphosate can complex with

756
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,560
manganes reduce manganes and make a

757
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,359
dissociation a dissociation for surface

758
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,880
that we call liant promoted

759
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,559
dissociation and Li promoted

760
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,920
dissociation decrease the catalic

761
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:01,078
capability for magaz oxide and another

762
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,200
way to passivate surface so this is a

763
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,519
negative feedback loop in long term if

764
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,480
you run this

765
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:13,119
experiment the gradation of G Posite

766
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,240
going to become less less and

767
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,280
less so I'm going to summarize entire

768
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,838
four

769
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,319
acts to what I learned and I want to

770
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:24,318
give you

771
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:31,440
this when we had load surface like a

772
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:34,838
minerals in soil say like this when we

773
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,800
add more organic matter into soil and

774
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:40,880
before more organal

775
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,680
Association the surface going to be more

776
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,440
hydrophobic and less

777
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,118
reable and in terms of absorption and

778
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,679
transformation for glyphosate we going

779
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,880
to have less

780
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:57,879
retention and also slower

781
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,000
absorption and slower dsorption

782
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,680
all of this means more transport into

783
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,400
the groundwater or as a or runoff into

784
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,838
the

785
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,000
streams for

786
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,719
transformation when you have higher

787
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,440
loading at the

788
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:17,879
surface again less transformation become

789
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,240
because absorption is a first step for

790
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,400
transformation when we have so this is a

791
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,639
kind of crucial step less absorption

792
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,280
less

793
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,679
transformation and so we found the trans

794
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,680
transformation became less

795
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:35,559
slower and when we have

796
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:39,358
transformation ampa pronounce more this

797
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:41,279
time compared to a surface without any

798
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,838
any orent

799
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,720
matter and that's not good and yeah

800
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:51,838
that's my conclusion somehow uh uh it's

801
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:55,399
going to be problematic High organ

802
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:57,759
matter and then so environment this way

803
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,358
in terms of contaminant transport and

804
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,200
contaminant fate but the problem is a

805
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,318
contaminant first but this is a

806
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,799
subsequent kind of

807
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,400
interactions another bonus uh thing I

808
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,640
want to share is about organic organic

809
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,358
interaction

810
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:18,000
order between glyphosate and those High

811
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:22,598
molecular way and low molecular Way D So

812
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,079
based on NMR studies so high high

813
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:29,720
protein strongly is much stronger to

814
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,318
make a CO calent or hydogen bonding to

815
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:34,039
glyos compared to paride and also

816
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:38,279
there's no interaction between low

817
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:41,119
moleular way uh molecule like peptide

818
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,119
and

819
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,240
glyphosate this already suggests that we

820
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:48,439
need to pay particular attention to the

821
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,239
type of do in

822
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,720
evaluating the behavior of

823
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,199
contaminants at the environmental

824
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:00,239
interfaces it could be water it could or

825
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:04,118
to be soil

826
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,118
system uh here I want to

827
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,598
acknowledge uh thank

828
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,800
you past eight years

829
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,920
yeah you supported me

830
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:30,639
and and you led me to uh to learn more

831
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:35,159
about soci science and

832
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:37,879
also to developing skills any skills you

833
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:41,920
let me to try

834
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,358
anything and also my lab labmates so my

835
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,358
previous labmates Michael Taylor Ariel

836
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:50,719
and my current labmates

837
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:54,400
Amy Luna and Alysa they are

838
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:57,199
awesome I know this is a teamw

839
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,280
workk and

840
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:03,639
it's not possible to do in a something

841
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,200
like this in a lonely and know so not

842
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:08,679
supporting

843
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:12,000
environments my special commente they

844
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:15,039
had good uh advice

845
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,358
uh and also I minored environmental

846
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,960
processes and environmental assessment

847
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:24,880
in environmental engineering school and

848
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,519
I had a time to learn about those things

849
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,318
with Damian and Matthew and I want to

850
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,679
thank uh Y and Hugh for helping me with

851
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,000
measuring

852
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,519
Toc uh

853
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,039
manganese phosph

854
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,039
glyphosate not glyphosate sorry auto

855
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,800
phosphate because they have

856
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,159
IC by

857
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,400
chromatography

858
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:57,960
uh I use ccmr facilities and different

859
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:01,880
facilities at Cornel lcms at bti and

860
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:04,280
measuring a surface area Z the size Z

861
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,920
the potential in

862
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,079
energy

863
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:14,480
Institute and I was I worked with the

864
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:14,480
Robert Page to make that micr

865
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,559
director sorry

866
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,358
uh some some of those researchers and

867
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,559
also some of those scientists they are

868
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,318
really uh supporting and inspiring for

869
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:39,079
me Linda nichelson for supporting me to

870
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:43,920
do NMR studies and uh Mary MCB is

871
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,960
a you say his research and his attitude

872
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,400
is

873
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,358
inspiring what I'm doing here he started

874
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,960
I don't know maybe 30 years ago to study

875
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:58,920
this I'm just adding 11 keys to what he

876
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,920
found in the past like a

877
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,358
Years also there people from different

878
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,680
loc places that they help me to do

879
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,880
modeling for some stuff are not shown

880
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:14,199
here that the thing

881
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,880
like Eugene Elton helped me to do pck

882
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:21,159
modeling for manganese

883
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:27,280
fractions and also my friend neria help

884
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:30,679
me to do a 1D transport in hydras

885
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,680
and at the end my

886
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,280
family my lovely wife R and adorable

887
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:41,598
kids a and

888
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,079
Lena they made a positive environment

889
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,920
and safe environment for me to do this

890
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:51,318
research and also my friend s

891
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:56,119
Teddy Sonam you know I think you know

892
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:59,000
son uh Richard is my business uh friend

893
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,720
U he's my founder I'm running a sub

894
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,480
company is my founder and his co-

895
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:06,759
founded and Michael Schmid Michael

896
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,760
Schmid

897
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:15,480
twice thank you so much um it's over but

898
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,480
if you have any question I G take those

899
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:30,599
questions question yes I have the sarite

900
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:32,719
was fining the ability of the gly to and

901
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:38,240
the idea there is that it's going to

902
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:38,239
then perhaps reduce the chemical

903
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:48,118
transformation the first this first

904
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:51,039
second act is about absorption an iron

905
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,240
oxide so an iron oxide there is no

906
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,480
transformation for glyphosate so what we

907
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:00,039
see is a pure impact on absorption of

908
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,599
so it diminishes absorption of

909
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:05,239
glyphosate but so I needed to work with

910
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,240
another molecule actually it's a fair

911
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:12,439
question and I picked protean because I

912
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:15,318
had a batch study before starting the

913
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,760
transformation study I picked different

914
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:23,039
Organics liin polysaccharide polyalc

915
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,440
acid protean and other stuff that are

916
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,119
people can detect in soil mix them with

917
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,280
Mages oxide and and started to see the

918
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,838
transformation of Organics itself before

919
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,480
add glyphosate I found proteins more

920
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:39,119
stable at surface that means less

921
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,440
problematic for me if want to detect the

922
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,559
bipu or I'm going to have more stable

923
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,000
surface to see a transformation for

924
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:51,960
glyphosate so that was the reason I

925
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,798
changed from Pacar to protean on

926
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,039
manes I guess my followup question there

927
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,719
is

928
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,199
in terms of in terms of what the

929
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,159
behavior is since

930
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:05,039
Sol um it seems like you know to get

931
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:08,279
chemical transformation you need to get

932
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,519
interaction with the surface yeah um but

933
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,359
in terms of like entic or microbial

934
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:16,239
degradation that's going to be maximized

935
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:18,119
in solution and so potentially you have

936
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,519
one form of transformation is when

937
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,920
you're on the surface but then processes

938
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,559
that are inhibiting that form of trans

939
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,880
that form of transformation might

940
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,880
actually enhance microbial trans

941
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,880
Teri

942
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:44,839
system yeah that's that's

943
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:48,639
a fair and valid uh fact so it's not in

944
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:51,239
the at surface more available for

945
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:54,318
bacteria also more available for ex

946
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:58,639
enzymes can be degradated but those

947
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,639
are biotically instead of

948
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,480
atically thank

949
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:12,118
you yeah it's good to to follow up like

950
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,639
the now system needs to be have a micro

951
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,280
how it's going to

952
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:18,078
be organ

953
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,119
Association and

954
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:24,000
micro that's could be something to yeah

955
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,318
interesting all right so for the

956
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,639
interest of time I think great thank you

957
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:28,639
very much
