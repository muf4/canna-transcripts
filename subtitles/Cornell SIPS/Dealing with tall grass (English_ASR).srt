University hi this is Frank Rossy for

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,679
the Cornell turf grass video log and

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,719
this week we're talking about mowing now

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,519
in the springtime you get that surge of

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,118
growth because we know about 60 to 70%

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,640
of all the clippings produced for the

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,640
entire season are produced in the first

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
6 weeks of the growing season so it's

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,199
very typical that we're going to mow

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,198
more in the spring now for those of you

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,840
striving for a more sustainable approach

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,920
to your lawn maybe you're going to cut

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,439
back on mowing a little bit and so what

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,480
happens is you're left to have to cut

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,960
the grass when it's really high now of

17
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,718
course we don't want clippings clumping

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,079
up everywhere as that can be a problem

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
from a light shading of the turf so it

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,239
might be worthwhile to just sort of SC

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,439
scratch them around set the mower as

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,839
high as you can try to mow slowly so

23
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,198
that you're Distributing the clippings

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,640
and most importantly make sure you're

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,839
mowing when it's dry that'll allow for

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,399
the clippings to disperse and in the end

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,160
you may find if you just Skip One mowing

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,359
per month you're cutting your mowing 25%

29
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,519
for the entire year and that can have a

30
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,519
real benefit on fuel expenses as well as

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,359
improving the carbon emissions in the

32
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,000
environment thanks for joining me for
