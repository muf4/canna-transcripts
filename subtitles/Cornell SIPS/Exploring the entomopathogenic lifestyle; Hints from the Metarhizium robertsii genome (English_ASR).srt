1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,960
so um

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
i'm part of a

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
research group that he's very much

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:21,679
interested in endomorphogenic fungi

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,720
particular secondary metabolism of this

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,358
group of

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,358
organisms

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,320
why

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,599
this interest

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,238
well the main reason is because these

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,238
fungi are

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,679
used in biological control

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,159
and bio control it's a kind of

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,840
reverse it's the opposite of

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,039
the interested plant pathologists

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
usually have

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,759
we would like to know how

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,679
to kill something better plant

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,479
pathologists are more interested in how

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,119
to protect a plant it's kind of

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,759
reversed but at the end of the day what

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,759
we both would like to know is how our

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,399
favorite organism works

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,840
and what makes it uh

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,000
virulent or and dangerous or beneficial

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,799
in our case

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,079
so these are just uh

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,320
three

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,319
uh

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
quotes where i would say it's

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,679
about bank control

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
uh

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,840
generally speaking we want to something

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
something that is more virulent to

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
control better our pests

38
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,039
we would like to have our biocontrol

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
agent to be

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
more

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,359
resilient in the environment and to

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,159
avoid collateral damage so if we cannot

43
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,640
kill what we do not intend to kill and

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,799
also not to kill

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
who uses this battle control is like the

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,520
farmer some vibrational legend may

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,520
reduce stocks

48
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,879
so i was talking to you about uh

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,640
before we are interested in methodism

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,560
and this is just to uh relate

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
to you a little bit this phylogenetic

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
trees that

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,118
is uh describes a hypo creating clay in

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,520
red you will

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,680
are these cleats are basically uh

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
anthropology fungi

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
dividing the three major uh

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,480
groups

59
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,840
but what i would like you to just focus

60
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,919
besides these red plates is that on top

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,159
of here you find fusarium gibberella

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,878
trichoderma things

63
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,079
organs probably are very well accustomed

64
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,759
about

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,319
with

66
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,159
also interesting is that in the sea or

67
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,799
red

68
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,199
you will see also some

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,439
green things here is the triceps and

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,799
deploy clay basically these are

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,359
renegade fungi they probably wear

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,319
metal pathogens and they reversed

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,440
back to the

74
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,238
plants either as a plant pathogens or

75
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,439
are endophytoplastics in case of a

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
bitcoin

77
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,158
and they bear a lot of resemblance to

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,158
many original

79
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,280
pathogenic filter

80
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,919
so why

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,158
do we focus on this

82
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,158
organism why material reversion

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,319
this species and particularly strength

84
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:26,318
is one of the most studied uh interval

85
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:29,199
pathogenic uh fungi there are others but

86
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,439
this is for sure one that has the most

87
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,598
the highest interest is a generalized

88
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,560
pathogen one thing i forgot to mention

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,679
is that

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,680
among these

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,439
pathogens there is some sort of

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
specialization but

93
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,479
many many times you can see just a

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
preference

95
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,919
towards some insects versus the other

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
this guy infects about 700 different

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,439
species at least that's what's reported

98
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,439
in literature some are more

99
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,359
sensitive than others

100
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,438
the sexual stage it's uh it's known it's

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
uh very rarely observed this is called

102
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,120
metacorpus never seen just a picture on

103
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,879
the web

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,080
uh so we are dealing with a uh

105
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,759
basically uh canadian

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
reproduction

107
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,519
in in

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,758
most of the cases and the molecular

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,160
basis of developments have been explored

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,400
we know something about this guy

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
but

112
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,000
not much i think i forgot to turn this

113
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,000
on

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
much better

115
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,639
so uh as a

116
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,680
customer i should talk you about the

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,960
life cycle of metabolism how

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,199
this guy infects uh its hosts and his

119
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,599
life aside the life cycle is really

120
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,080
really simple it starts with the

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,680
canadian landing on these two little

122
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,839
fellow larva and uh

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
germinating producing liquid sodium tube

124
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,719
uh sorry uh

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,038
germ tube and then an acrylic

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,160
and uh penetration structure

127
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,399
the penetration structure goes through

128
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
the cuticle the insect cuticle insect

129
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,758
skin now

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
the difference between this

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,479
cuticle and the plant cuticle is that

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,479
this is really really thick and is a

133
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,959
cellular and it's made mostly of

134
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,599
proteins and kindly crosslink many times

135
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,198
with some phenols and it can be as tough

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
as

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,759
a shrimp shape

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,840
so can be really tough not always

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,000
so its primary target the primary target

140
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,000
of the region is the hemocytic cavity

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,959
and the amyloid basically the insect

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,279
blood

143
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,439
when it reaches the insect blood it

144
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,439
switches

145
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,399
there is a morphogenetic switch it

146
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,519
changes from filamentous to yeast these

147
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,079
yeast-like forms are called blastospores

148
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,560
and they disseminate these

149
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,879
fungus throughout the

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,478
hemocytic cavity

151
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:09,120
it almost works as a blood

152
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,758
infection it doesn't target as far as we

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,478
know any specific organ so it goes

154
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
throughout the insect

155
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,560
and

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,800
to put it simply just kill me sick they

157
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
kill it we don't know exactly

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
how

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
basically when the insect is

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
is dead

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,680
the fungus outgrows

162
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
grows back outside on the surface of the

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,478
of the of the insect and the scary way

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,800
so you see these mum is covered in in

165
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,719
case of there is a green green stuff

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,759
they are kind of

167
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,160
gruesome

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
and then the cycle starts again

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,039
now we have a

170
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,719
sequence the genome of this this

171
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,719
particular organism and

172
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,439
what i'm going to going to talk about

173
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,319
you are just a few

174
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,639
specific uh

175
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
pieces of this uh

176
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,879
of the

177
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,639
entire story

178
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,279
and uh

179
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,840
particularly these two these two i uh

180
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,839
these two

181
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,639
topics one is about carbon source

182
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,240
preference and toxin production

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,840
and

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,439
also there is something about well

185
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,758
is an important topic but i'm not going

186
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,759
to touch about uh today because

187
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,159
it would require too much time but it's

188
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
they are going

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
detection by the immune system is also

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
kind of important and we are

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
looking at it

192
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,199
so

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,479
uh just to show you uh

194
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,160
something about this this

195
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,680
fungus

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,720
genome of this fungus is uh this slide

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
is

198
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,879
to

199
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,639
tell you about

200
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,598
the fact that this is just an average

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,038
astronomic test a genome of a 40

202
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,038
megabases

203
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,639
and has a number of gene uh models for

204
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,759
encoding models

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,519
12

206
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,439
400 and

207
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,519
so it's more or less what you expect we

208
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,199
have from our

209
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:29,519
average as we might see

210
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
now

211
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,158
my goal

212
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,478
during our goal doing this work is to

213
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,200
try to understand

214
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,278
what makes

215
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
what makes methodist methods what what

216
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,039
is the difference with metallism without

217
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,159
a fungi

218
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,439
so to do these comparisons i felt we

219
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,199
felt that

220
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,519
we need to have a large panel of fungi

221
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
to

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
basically uh refer to

223
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,719
uh

224
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,958
the more the the better here this is the

225
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:10,959
list of 48 fungi and four uh

226
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,958
bacteria that i use throughout the study

227
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,759
they have

228
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,200
different lifestyles

229
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,958
and

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
although this has to be taken with a

231
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,719
little bit of

232
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,399
caution because many of these fungi are

233
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,240
yes plant pathogen but they can be

234
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,759
opportunistic

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
animal pathogens

236
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:36,000
uh some antimo pathogens show

237
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,839
endothelial capabilities

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,480
and so on so this is a very

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
rough classification of this reference

240
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
here

241
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
now

242
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,240
if we look at the

243
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,759
one way to represent what's peculiar

244
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,759
within a immediate

245
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,519
genome is just to find a relative

246
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,720
abundance of

247
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,320
some

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,399
protein classes some functional classes

249
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,440
like protease

250
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,799
carbohydrate carbohydrate actin enzymes

251
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,959
secondary metabolism and other

252
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,078
uh the just

253
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,359
showing the relative abundance like that

254
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:22,479
as in this case uh mechanism is

255
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
significantly enriched in protests

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
peptidases

257
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,759
it's interesting in itself but

258
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,839
it

259
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,958
doesn't tell the entire story it doesn't

260
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
make you

261
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,399
allowed to make really

262
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,519
contrast and compare and tell

263
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,360
what set these fungus apart if anything

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
from other ones is it just

265
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,519
gene composition and protein

266
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,199
potential or

267
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,278
the way these proteins are regulated

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,000
so what i'm going to show to you it's

269
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,958
something i uh

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,958
a technique that i've been trying to use

271
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,799
and then suddenly i found other people

272
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,639
to try to so i was pleased

273
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,319
that i was on the right track

274
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,000
it's the use of principal component

275
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
analysis to reorganize these

276
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,399
uh these

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
proteins

278
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,200
and to try to uh correlate their

279
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,839
presence with the lifestyle

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,480
so principal component analysis is just

281
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,959
for you you don't know about it it's a

282
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,759
way to reduce the dimensionality of your

283
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,159
problem you start with in this case 29

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,360
dimension trying to define

285
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,199
lifestyle

286
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,278
and

287
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
principle component makes up a linear

288
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,320
combination of these variables

289
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,959
and produces basically what are called

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,079
latent variables or components

291
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,199
that allows you to synthesize these very

292
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,399
complex complex

293
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,720
problem in a in a simpler

294
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,039
fashion interpretation is

295
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,680
a little bit different but

296
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,078
so we have that these 29 protein classes

297
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,838
have been summarizing two components

298
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,159
that

299
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,880
uh harbor

300
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,278
explains sorry about 60 percent of the

301
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,439
entire variability so it's

302
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,200
very very explanatory and what is

303
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,639
remarkable is just

304
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,879
using pca on those groups i showed

305
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,278
before just as a relative abundance

306
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,919
you can see that for example the

307
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,720
internal pathogen tend to

308
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,479
group

309
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,240
20 groups tend to stay close together

310
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,079
uh plant pathogen tend to be here

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,000
uh in this other side of the plot and uh

312
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,120
here there are some animal pathogens the

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
yeast

314
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,959
so basically

315
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
uh

316
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,518
just dealing with the relative abundance

317
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,639
of some protein classes you can

318
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,039
reorganize and describe

319
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,200
a little bit lifestyle it's not perfect

320
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,199
because as i told you

321
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,440
also the our classification what

322
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
lifestyle is is now

323
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
it's not

324
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,199
it's very rough

325
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,399
an alternative way to do this to look at

326
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,480
this on the other side is that before we

327
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,559
cluster we put together the the the

328
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
we use basically just

329
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,638
the uh independent variables where

330
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,679
coding classes

331
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
here

332
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,439
using hierarchical clustering analysis

333
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
you can do

334
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
both you can cluster

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,600
the the

336
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,239
the variables but also you can cluster

337
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,560
see how they they affect clustering of

338
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,120
the of the of your data set

339
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,199
just uh you don't need to look

340
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,200
too carefully this you just look at

341
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,839
there is a dendrogram here and there are

342
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,839
bands basically what you can see is that

343
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,560
just using rough calcification in

344
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,680
peptidases glycoside hydrolysis

345
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,559
this fungi can be grouped together a

346
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,159
little bit like in pca

347
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,399
and you can see the entire pathogens

348
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,078
grouped here as they were before

349
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,039
using the pca plot

350
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,919
because they share more or less same

351
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
kind of relative composition of

352
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,120
these proteins here are most of the

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,278
plant pathogens and some suburbs

354
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,799
here are our

355
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,799
bacteria they're completely different

356
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,879
they are almost an out group

357
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,439
uh there is one

358
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,399
entire pathogen here there is a

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
always

360
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,919
a little bit of an outlier

361
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
here there are some animal pathogens so

362
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,360
it's a nice way to at a glance tell

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
apart

364
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,278
stuff

365
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
tell apart species

366
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,120
i was quite i mean i was really

367
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,800
surprised it would work so well

368
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
now if oh let me go back if we

369
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,958
get

370
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
to

371
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,759
analyze some subgroups for example like

372
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,920
lipase and glycoside idolists they were

373
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,278
particularly interesting

374
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,039
other reason

375
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:16,078
a look at the other

376
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:19,120
and the families within this large group

377
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,198
family of life basis you can see that

378
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,600
the story repeats itself in the intimate

379
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,559
pathogens tend to again clusters

380
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
together

381
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,039
and the plant pathogens are

382
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,040
here

383
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,120
and even more if you look at glycoside

384
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,399
idols

385
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,720
these phenomenon is even more marked

386
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,039
if you look at polysaccharide active

387
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
enzymes analyzed using principal

388
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,919
component analysis

389
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,039
you can see how separated these

390
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,838
species are here are the bacteria yeasts

391
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,559
animal pathogen entomopathogen

392
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,120
microparasites plant pathogens and

393
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,559
sucrose

394
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
well it's it's that's nice

395
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,399
but

396
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,360
even more explanatory is is uh

397
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
the the other phase the other side of

398
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,320
the analysis that can be conducted with

399
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,079
uh hierarchical clustering which you can

400
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,040
see also better how these fungi clusters

401
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,719
together

402
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,759
when you use

403
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,480
this uh many

404
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,639
glycoside hydrolysis and the other

405
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
carbohydrate active enzyme as a

406
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,639
clustering

407
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,559
variable and you can just see how this

408
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,399
cluster organized you can also see the

409
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,719
bands here

410
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
how

411
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,159
uh some

412
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,839
bavaria sorry some animal pathogens are

413
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,278
clustered together and they

414
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,279
both miss

415
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,559
some things here

416
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,039
and they have

417
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,359
instead more of something else

418
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,039
then you cannot read because

419
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
you have to go up here

420
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,958
and how the reverse is true for some

421
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,159
blood button for the plant pathogens are

422
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,198
down here

423
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,399
while

424
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,119
as expected

425
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,199
the yeast have almost nothing and very

426
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,438
little of

427
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,959
hyporisis

428
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,679
and the same is for the animal uh

429
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,558
some animal pathogen the

430
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
so

431
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,279
if we look and zoom in and try to

432
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,279
understand what's

433
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,359
more and what's less what are these

434
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,119
holes here

435
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,558
you discover a very interesting thing

436
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
that you could not discover just with

437
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,639
the enrichment analysis

438
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,919
is that most of the families that

439
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,360
they've been missing in

440
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,520
methodism and in

441
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,599
other interval pathogenic fungi belong

442
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,400
to these

443
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,599
glycoside idol is family so

444
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,038
you can

445
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,359
read what they

446
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,599
do usually

447
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,439
for the most part this is a summer

448
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,199
there is more but basically what's

449
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,919
missing there are

450
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
enzymes carbohydrate enzymes they

451
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,880
degrade

452
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,279
in celluloses

453
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,160
and pectins

454
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,879
so and then i wonder is that true

455
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,679
does it have anything to do with reality

456
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
does it is really so bad at growing on

457
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
these

458
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,119
substrates

459
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,079
and so if you see

460
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,719
uh if you can compare gibberella in

461
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,879
mediterranean

462
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
basically inspecting is the ventilated

463
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
pectin

464
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,759
you can see how

465
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,479
the reading roberts after seven days

466
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,960
grows relatively bad compared to the to

467
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400
the growing unjust glucose so it's ten

468
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,079
percent

469
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
and you can see the the culture here

470
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,759
here's a catalyst in glucose these are

471
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,320
called electronic acid one percent the

472
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,160
same amount of glucose

473
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,159
171 so it barely grows there it's

474
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,080
it doesn't like it at all the same on

475
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,640
any celluloses

476
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:04,558
it doesn't grow

477
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
these are glucose this is uh

478
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,839
that is known to be able to grow these

479
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,000
substrates

480
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,359
so

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,798
that's one thing

482
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,079
that tells

483
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,519
distinguishes

484
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,399
metal insulin and other internal

485
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,400
pathogens from

486
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,839
the bulk of

487
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,360
uh fungi cyclops and special

488
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,038
pathogens

489
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,199
but there is something that also they

490
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,440
have

491
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,360
that other fungible head

492
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
it's been said over and over they are

493
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,279
they're reaching

494
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,279
the region when integral pathogens are

495
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:47,759
very rich in peptidases and uh

496
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,440
kittens which is true there are

497
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,519
a lot of them and they needed to

498
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
penetrate through that thick cuticle i

499
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,240
showed you before

500
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,558
but also tribularis

501
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,798
out of those factory cases of gluconexis

502
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,319
and is not an insect pathogen

503
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,798
uh

504
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,399
and also what is interesting is that

505
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,960
just a regression trigonoderma for

506
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,880
example this swath of catalysis have

507
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
been shown not to participate very much

508
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,880
in micro parasites

509
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,160
something else

510
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,160
makes them a microcurrency

511
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:25,439
what uh

512
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,440
methodism and some other uh

513
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,038
metabologins have that other fungi

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,679
usually not all

515
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:37,519
is these three classes

516
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,280
basically release monomers from

517
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,759
animal

518
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,038
carbohydrates

519
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,359
particularly this is interesting

520
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,798
i'll show you something about this

521
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,000
before these these are single

522
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,759
genes

523
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,919
uh that they have

524
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,720
and the

525
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,559
the anthropology have and other fungi on

526
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,480
them but the synergy can make a big

527
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,480
difference

528
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,079
this seems to be acquired by horizontal

529
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,240
gene transfer because it's very similar

530
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,879
to some bacteria

531
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,400
this i'm not sure

532
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
this is very similar to animal

533
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
of how you know foreign raised lights

534
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,798
why it's it's really interesting because

535
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,558
these are pathogenesis factor in uh in

536
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,279
sorry bacterial

537
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,639
animal bacterial

538
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,399
pathogens

539
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,559
in particular in sofia caucus saying

540
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,240
that it was another one a

541
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:40,079
deletion of single pl 8 just knocks it

542
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
down

543
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,519
it's much less virulent

544
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,759
and it's been shown that these

545
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,759
these

546
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,519
enzymes basically

547
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,558
facilitate penetration and spread of

548
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,558
these of these

549
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,599
bacteria

550
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,038
and um

551
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:09,519
and provide also uh

552
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:12,079
monomers uh from hyaluronate to

553
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,839
the facility that grows without that

554
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,879
enzyme looks like they don't do very

555
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,759
well in

556
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,760
connecting tissues

557
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,399
so

558
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,600
this was

559
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
something i told you about

560
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,839
what

561
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,360
methodolysium

562
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,319
what is the preference of metabolism and

563
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,079
other antibiotic fungi regarding

564
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,558
carbohydrates that are very important

565
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,359
carbon source but one thing we would

566
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,359
like to know is

567
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,240
how does veneration requests are

568
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,038
infecting kill itself what are the

569
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,558
pathogenicity factor well i can

570
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,759
uh tell you that we don't know very much

571
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,879
yet time

572
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,480
we have hints i'll discuss to you about

573
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,240
now

574
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,720
and the framework here is a classic

575
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,440
paradigm that reminds the difference the

576
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,440
reminds the

577
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,599
and microsoft

578
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,079
seen in one pathogen

579
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,439
uh it's been said that some

580
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,439
ethnopathogens are stealth attackers so

581
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,279
they penetrate they sit there they are

582
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,159
not recognized they grow and then where

583
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:27,839
the biomass is too large they basically

584
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,520
the the insecticides for the issue

585
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:34,399
another is a kind of shock and all uh

586
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,879
the fungus penetrates and

587
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,600
immediately the the host

588
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
and

589
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,719
grows on the spots

590
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
it's not

591
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,320
sure what really happens but

592
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,038
we know there's probably something in

593
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,038
between really

594
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,879
one remarkable things that the genome

595
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,879
tells us is that these uh

596
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,119
genomes are enriched in in

597
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,120
uh

598
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,918
very well

599
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,639
in homologs of bacterial toxins usually

600
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,360
these bacterial toxins bacterotoxins

601
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,000
what i mean is uh animal pathogen

602
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,599
bacterial that are animal pathogens uh

603
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,960
usually they are multimedia they are

604
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,759
multi they have multiple subunits

605
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,880
what we find in in in the

606
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,720
in

607
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,159
interval pathogens are just some of

608
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,360
these subunits

609
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,559
it's not really

610
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,798
clear what the role is or what their

611
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,278
action and function is

612
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,798
but it's remarkable to see this

613
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,519
may be

614
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,359
in all these genomes

615
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,240
so they're similarity with material

616
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,639
toxins are low but significance

617
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,120
and as i said before in most cases only

618
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,159
some of these subunits are found in in

619
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,038
other

620
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
futures

621
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,640
just to give you a breakdown or

622
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,080
a summary of what

623
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:11,200
these toxins do in insect sorry in

624
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:13,038
bacteria you can see a plethora of of a

625
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,759
really

626
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,720
nasty

627
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,119
things

628
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,360
like he called about introductions value

629
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,038
found in

630
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,839
vibrio cholera

631
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,640
in

632
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,319
in skeletal

633
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,278
pertussis toxins is an immunosuppressant

634
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,278
liptheria toxin also is a nice not very

635
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,960
nice toxin and then there is about the

636
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,278
buttocks

637
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,278
you will see neurotoxin they

638
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,159
basically inhibit the

639
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,119
release of acetylcholine

640
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,080
and other ones so they are there nobody

641
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,798
has characterized them yet they are

642
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,798
particularly

643
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,640
present

644
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,720
in entomopathogen and if you look at

645
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
their distribution

646
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,240
there's something kind of interesting

647
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,240
that i said before they are typical of

648
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,119
this group of entomopathogens but

649
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:17,278
if you look carefully there are some

650
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:19,119
fungi that are completely devoid of them

651
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,839
but some

652
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,119
like my report or even

653
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,759
cochlears

654
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,319
sometimes they have one or two copies of

655
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,278
some of them and it's not known but

656
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,359
methamphetamine have

657
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,480
lots of them and some

658
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,119
in their

659
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,120
composition assessment

660
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,839
is not the same for all interpreters

661
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:45,918
what is present in bulgaria tends to be

662
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,918
less present in migrating vice versa

663
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,759
if you look at the expression we have

664
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,400
some transcriptome data and the

665
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,558
expression these toxins inside the

666
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,038
vidalia worm they design insects also we

667
00:26:54,558 --> 00:27:00,319
see that some are upregulated compared

668
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:03,919
to compared to the axonic culture

669
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:06,639
they tend to be much lower uh

670
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,480
express a much lower level or not

671
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,720
expressed at all

672
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,720
one

673
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
particular

674
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,319
specific

675
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,919
bacterial

676
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,960
light toxin has been recently

677
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,200
characterized in a decoy

678
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
this is very similar to insect toxins

679
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
and uh when it's been expressed over

680
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,240
expressed in in

681
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,960
in bacteria and fed to

682
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,359
actually injected inside it

683
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,079
was demonstrated is

684
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,079
toxic and

685
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,759
as an insecticidal

686
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,798
capability

687
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,798
but

688
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,240
as i said before what

689
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,158
one of the things we are interested the

690
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,038
most

691
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,480
in this fungi is

692
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,480
secondary metabolism

693
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,558
thus the cemetery metabolism had a role

694
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
in meteorological regression ci

695
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,440
virulence

696
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,000
well

697
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,120
i have to go back in time a little bit

698
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and tell you

699
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,278
that

700
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,278
until relative recently

701
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:22,918
this particular compound structure is a

702
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,919
non-robust non-ribosomally

703
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:30,640
synthesized peptide was considered

704
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,079
detoxing of metabolism and soapy why

705
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,960
it's been

706
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:38,720
known for many many years

707
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,759
it's mildly insecticidal

708
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
it's

709
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,640
produced by some strain in

710
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
in vitro

711
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,159
in uh

712
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,719
sometimes large amount in large amounts

713
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,159
and uh it's been correlated to the

714
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,679
preference of the of the of the of the

715
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,120
pathogen

716
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,679
which means that

717
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,398
usually insects that are more sensitive

718
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,559
to destruction have been shown to be

719
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,439
even more sensitive to the

720
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,398
to the furnace so oh this is the toxin

721
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,200
well we have characterized

722
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,158
knocked out the genes for the synthesis

723
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,120
of synthetics for all these three

724
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,600
uh

725
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,599
uh

726
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,360
three you know all these three compounds

727
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,278
basically we have manuscripts for each

728
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,678
one of

729
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:26,679
uh them

730
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,440
and

731
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,720
basically none of them made any

732
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,600
difference in the individuals

733
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
they are as

734
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,599
uh spirit i would say as wild type

735
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,919
really you cannot you can hardly see any

736
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,119
difference at all

737
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
but

738
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,439
again going back to the genome what we

739
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,519
know is that uh the this fungus is

740
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,720
really loaded with seminary metabolic

741
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,720
pathways it's

742
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:06,558
as many pks hybrids and

743
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:09,038
ribosomal peptide synthesis and and uh

744
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:13,839
mercenary genes so there is we have our

745
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,879
own way to go to uh rule out the

746
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,759
the

747
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,679
the

748
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,798
participation of secondary metabolism to

749
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,840
any facets of the of the

750
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,839
of the disease

751
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,559
uh

752
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,599
it's true that many many many uh of this

753
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,720
pathway are unknown but uh medallions

754
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,038
also show

755
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,839
that there are a few of them the other

756
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,839
is just to

757
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,599
have tantalized similarities to known

758
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:46,158
secondary metabolite pathways like

759
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:49,199
uh the air got

760
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,200
synthetic gene clustering concepts

761
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,558
uh there is a

762
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,798
gene cluster is very similar in

763
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,879
methodism

764
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,879
and uh there is this other

765
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:07,839
pathway that is almost identical in

766
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,440
in penicillin aethiopica and this has

767
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,199
been characterized produces um

768
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,159
tetracycline microfountains of

769
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,159
antibacteria

770
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,640
but for the rest it's really difficult

771
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:24,640
to to

772
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,200
make sense of what uh they might be

773
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,200
and also

774
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
oops

775
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,599
these words

776
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
i know

777
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,240
this is

778
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,839
thank you

779
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,399
so and if you compare the expression of

780
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,398
many of these

781
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,839
a sample of this secondary metabolic g

782
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,759
in

783
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:33,839
vitro and in vivo you can hardly spot a

784
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,480
difference

785
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,240
so this is a time course of the

786
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,839
expression of

787
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,038
vast majority of nfps

788
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:47,359
and bks and rps hybrids

789
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,839
in spodoptera exhibit there is a

790
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,719
insect and

791
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:55,439
so time course is between 24 hours after

792
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,278
infection 120 hours this is the not

793
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,919
inoculated control

794
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,480
the mock inoculated insect this is the g

795
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,880
dna control just to see if the pcl work

796
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,720
this is on cuticle and here is in in

797
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,360
axonic culture and

798
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,360
in canadian

799
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,960
to get a good amplification on uh from

800
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,839
insect is kind of hard because the

801
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
amount of the fungus tends to be

802
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,759
low

803
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,919
but

804
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,839
you can see whatever is expressed in

805
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,600
vivo is expressed in vitro

806
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,480
uh and whatever is not expressed

807
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,798
numerical is not expressed in vitro

808
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,360
so this is a little bit

809
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,079
i have to tell you um

810
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,158
disappointing for us

811
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,759
because we like secondary with health

812
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,559
plans

813
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:46,000
but there is another way to

814
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,519
quicken the a quick and dirty way to

815
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,240
have a

816
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,960
rough idea of what the secondary

817
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:57,839
metabolism does

818
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,840
and is the deletion of these pptas

819
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,720
so why

820
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,639
pvds are required to activate basically

821
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,078
most of the secondary metabolite genes

822
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,079
and rps and pkss

823
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,838
now the terpenes

824
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,279
and without these genes the

825
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,838
these uh

826
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,560
proteins are

827
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,358
inactive because they cannot add the

828
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,440
phosphopathy modification at the

829
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,598
destination uh

830
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,760
domains and basically they are there but

831
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,480
they are not functional so once you

832
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,119
remove the right uh phosphopathy

833
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,119
transferase

834
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,480
what you have is that all nrps and dks

835
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
are not controlled

836
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,158
also what you have is lysine absorption

837
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
basically

838
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,320
what happens is that the fungus is not

839
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,440
able to synthesize

840
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
lysine

841
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,358
they don't produce severe force and as i

842
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,640
said before the secondary part of the

843
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,639
secondary metabolism is called

844
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,078
and here how is the ppt-1 mutant looks

845
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,199
like

846
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,839
this white type pigmented is completely

847
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,838
white

848
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,399
that's telltale that the the the

849
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,400
knockout uh

850
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,760
so what happens then if you look at

851
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,759
these uh

852
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,919
basic

853
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
to the

854
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,680
mortality to the survival

855
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
in time of uh insecting a little bit one

856
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,759
type

857
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,639
at this level of inoculum you have that

858
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,200
by day seven

859
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,598
75 percent of the insects are dead with

860
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,439
ppt-1 mutants

861
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,320
there is almost no

862
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,159
uh

863
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,559
mortality

864
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,279
so ppt-1 mutants are nearly uh

865
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,719
non-virulent and since we do those

866
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,480
responses we can uh

867
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,799
um

868
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,559
assess the potency of

869
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,240
of the of the of the two uh organisms

870
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,519
what i mean is that using those

871
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,838
responses you can calculate how much

872
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,358
binocular you need to kill fifty percent

873
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,599
of the population

874
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,440
and a rough calculation

875
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,920
tells for the wild

876
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,159
alpha medium career for per meal to keep

877
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,559
off of the population in this particular

878
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,879
condition while for

879
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,599
for ppt one mutant you need

880
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,160
25 times as much so it's very much

881
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,320
alternating you need 25 times more

882
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:46,399
cornidia to

883
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,400
theory to get to the same town

884
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,519
so

885
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,920
in this

886
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,280
presentation i try to

887
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,079
present to you

888
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,599
uh information about uh

889
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,599
methodism and what

890
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,480
the genome tells us on its ability to

891
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,480
survive and

892
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,799
what the

893
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,000
virulence factor especially toxins can

894
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,560
be

895
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,480
the conclusion is that

896
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,000
meteorological mercy has expanded

897
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,639
approximately 50 peptides secondary

898
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,079
metabolites and

899
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,838
enzymes that allows it to thrive on

900
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,640
almonds of course

901
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,639
it's very less adapted to survival plant

902
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,039
than which was a surprise

903
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,400
compared to other furniture floors

904
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,000
and then the secondary metabolism

905
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,519
is required for

906
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
pathogenicity

907
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:48,320
i forgot to add these on on that one on

908
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,880
this slide is that also what is

909
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,920
characteristic also is the large amount

910
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,720
of bacterial uh

911
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,920
like toxins for which we don't have any

912
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,078
idea

913
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,119
about function and not being

914
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,760
characterized by anybody

915
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,200
with that said i

916
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,440
would like to acknowledge and thank uh

917
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:15,679
people from my love and my unit and the

918
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,838
collaborators we talked to and every

919
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,838
work worked with in the past

920
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,440
and special thanks william

921
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,720
for

922
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,000
her support

923
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,559
with that said

924
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,559
i will take questions

925
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:42,279
this has been a production of cornell
