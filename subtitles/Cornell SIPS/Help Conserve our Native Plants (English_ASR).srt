1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,599
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,679
University I'm here to tell you today

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:24,760
about our Ash seed collection Workshop

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:27,518
um so we started this effort um actually

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,400
three years ago we were funded um about

6
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,719
a three-year Grant from the northeastern

7
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,280
area St and private Forestry Association

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,039
and essentially we were tasked with

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,960
doing five workshops in New York state

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,399
each of the three years to educate

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,439
people on um you know the fact that

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,960
we're losing our Ash species across the

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:51,280
states and now across much of the East

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,558
um and in addition to these workshops we

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
um were tested with making 150

16
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:59,159
collections over the course of the three

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,840
years of the three most common uh as

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,799
species that we have have here in the

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,240
state so here on the right hand side of

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:10,560
the slide you have the Latin uh fenus is

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,919
the genus for ash so we have Americana

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,719
which is the white ash pennsylvanica

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,439
which is the Green Ash and which

24
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,438
is the black

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,400
ash so just a little bit about um the

26
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,840
Nationwide collection program because

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,400
this program you know it extends beyond

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,719
our efforts here

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,640
um in New York state um as I said it's a

30
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,239
US Forest Service effort so there's

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,799
collections happening you know all

32
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,959
over um you know from Ohio down to the

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
southeast um in

34
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,239
Massachusetts um it's a really big um

35
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,599
almost Nationwide effort that we're a

36
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,319
part of which is pretty exciting and the

37
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,199
general gist of it is that we want to

38
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,798
collect these seeds to preserve the

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,759
genetic diversity of um of Ash um and

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,759
I'll explain a little bit more about

41
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,679
that um in a second but um in essence

42
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,560
we're losing these species to an

43
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,159
invasive insect amerald ashb which I'm

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,560
sure the majority of you have heard

45
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:20,919
about by now um so these seeds will be

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,000
stored um long term up to 50 years um in

47
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:26,679
a US Forest Service seed bank down in

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,479
Georgia um and you know so that way

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,719
researchers and breeders will be able to

50
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,959
look at the genetics of these treat

51
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,959
and see if they can't you know breed a

52
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,920
more resistant species or you know look

53
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,840
a little more about why some trees are

54
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,598
more resistant than others um and not

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,319
only that you know the potential for

56
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,598
these seeds to be used um in future

57
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:52,119
restoration efforts once we have um the

58
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,679
problem of Aral ashor under control um

59
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,360
fingers crossed that we do one

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,800
day um so to tell you a little bit more

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,879
about Emerald ashore um as I said I

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,920
assume if you're a citizen of New York

63
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:07,439
State you have an infestation somewhere

64
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:10,719
near you um here in the catvills we

65
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,199
unfortunately home to the largest one of

66
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,519
the largest now and fastest growing

67
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:20,399
infestations in the state um so Emerald

68
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,039
ashor is a little teeny tiny beautiful

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,799
insect which is to Asia um it arrived

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:30,000
here in the states a long time ago um

71
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:34,040
probably in Detroit first and it came in

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,959
and packing material um for car parts so

73
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,479
it you know came into those those car

74
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,680
factories that Detroit was famous for um

75
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,759
and started infesting trees in Michigan

76
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,120
and Pathologists were really scratching

77
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,759
their heads over it because trees start

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,000
to show symptoms of infestation

79
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,959
before um the bug is actually visible so

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,639
you know they'll start dropping leaves

81
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,799
their canopy will thin they'll just you

82
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,158
know look off and they have this thing

83
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,000
called epicormic sprouting which is when

84
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,000
leaves actually come out of you know the

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,280
trunk itself or the base of the tree and

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,919
it's just a sign of of stress that

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,878
they're um the tissues that they use for

88
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,439
transporting nutrients and water are

89
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,319
being

90
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,120
compromised um so it was discovered in

91
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,040
Michigan in 2002 and it came to New York

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,240
in

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,240
2009 and now it's in over 24 States and

94
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,240
at least two Canadian provinces um

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
probably more than that it's incredibly

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,840
fast moving and hard to track because it

97
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,038
um it will be transported in infested

98
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:42,159
material like logs and Ash is a very

99
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:45,000
popular um useful

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
Timber um the green black and white

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,079
species of Ash that mentioned before

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,360
they're very Su um and unfortunately

103
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,399
expecting nearly 100% mortality in

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,840
forests um in Ash forests across the

105
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,399
state and you can see that it happens

106
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,279
really fast if you live near one of

107
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,918
these epicenters um as I said where I

108
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,839
live in the cat skills that arriv first

109
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,879
in

110
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,599
Woodstock um around 2009 probably a

111
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,719
little earlier it came and um already we

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,120
have over 95% mortality um in in those

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,919
areas I mean the ash are dead and have

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,120
fallen and you know it's the is over so

115
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:31,560
we're looking at functional extrap of

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,879
this species um this is a huge blow to

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,639
not only the ecology that these trees

118
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,079
are a part of but you know also

119
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,280
economically as I said it's a very

120
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:44,079
important Timber species so to take a

121
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,839
little look at you know why this matters

122
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,478
so much as I said you can see on the

123
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:52,359
left that map um is it's a distribution

124
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,639
of Ash by County so it's kind of like

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,919
the density of Ash in each County so you

126
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,680
can see up by Ontario there is a ton of

127
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,639
Ash I mean that's like 30% Ash in those

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,560
forests there so this is a huge huge

129
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,280
blow to lose those trees um but it's a

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,199
very common tree species throughout the

131
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,598
state um they somewhere around 7% of our

132
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,000
forests are ash and there on the right

133
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:23,879
is um a map from last year that looks at

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,918
sort of um the core areas of uh where

135
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,598
these EAB infestations have gotten

136
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,079
started and how they're spreading so the

137
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,279
black is like you know the are dead and

138
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,399
dying and the red is how it's sort of

139
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,359
spreading out from there um and to see

140
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,318
more updated maps of these they update

141
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,479
them you know maybe once or twice a year

142
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,960
you can look that up on the Department

143
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,439
of Environmental Conservation

144
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,839
website so this is just a closer look at

145
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,120
some of the biggest and fastest moving

146
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,279
um infestations in our state a lot of um

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,879
Urban and Suburban infestations Ash is a

148
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,918
very popular Street tree because it's um

149
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,680
you know super Hardy and toer into

150
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,598
pollution and compaction and things like

151
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,560
that so you know a lot of these streets

152
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:10,360
have um ash trees that are going to be

153
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,598
falling on houses and cars and you know

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,280
it's it's a it's a pretty serious

155
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,399
problem across you know many uh sort of

156
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,559
spheres um and one of the ways that

157
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,799
state has been trying to deal with this

158
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,280
problem is by setting up quarantines um

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,120
this particular strategy was enacted

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,038
last year I think it was maybe last

161
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,478
May or somewhere around there um so

162
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,519
there's

163
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:41,038
little you drawn stations and they're

164
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:43,519
trying to limit or regulate um the

165
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,759
infested materials that are moving in

166
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,598
and out of those areas because as I said

167
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,759
it's really

168
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,719
um very hard

169
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,560
to is to pop up because Timber or

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,879
firewood is around all the time if you

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,319
don't burn pieces to firewood or you

172
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,840
know you're transporting Timber during

173
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,039
flight season one of these little larvae

174
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:11,119
can metamorphose and just fly out of

175
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:14,639
that infested wood um as you're driving

176
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,439
along um so that's we have these rules

177
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,199
about don't move firewood more than 50

178
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,519
miles uh crow flies in New York state

179
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,919
because this is how these Forest pest

180
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,839
gets get

181
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,639
transported so you know some of the

182
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,799
other ways to deal with it other than

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,278
quarantine

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,000
um are removing the trees and replacing

185
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:39,240
them with something that is an ash um be

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,519
great and some native a lot of these um

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,799
these Ash are native but um they come

188
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,039
from sort of Midwestern stock um so we

189
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,679
you know we like to think about you

190
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,719
genetically local um seed stock it you

191
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:56,359
know makes things kind of more

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,519
accustomed to vories of our clim and

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,278
stuff like that um you can use in ITI

194
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,480
sdes um in do work ases um so long as

195
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,039
they're not you know super infested um

196
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,039
however it's

197
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,759
expensive a beautiful specimen tree or a

198
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,719
great seed producer or something hanging

199
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,278
over your house you know by all means

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,278
that's a great option to treat it um but

201
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,720
again you're treat it

202
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:29,480
for

203
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,600
expensive trols native like woodpecker

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,879
non-native um there are a few species of

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
wasps that are least right now that are

206
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,039
pretty effective

207
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,079
parasitoids um you know however they do

208
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,078
Target some of our native ash

209
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,719
borers um and by the way our na Ash Bor

210
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:49,719
not a not a

211
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,560
problem is um our ash trees are adapted

212
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,680
and evolved to deal with our native

213
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,239
Ash and then there's seed colion as a

214
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,599
great management option I'll tell you a

215
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,600
little more about that um why we like

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
seed collection so

217
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,919
much you know outside actual habitat um

218
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,439
so if we can't stop EAB we can take

219
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,078
their seeds and Bank them and ensure

220
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,120
that those trees have a chance of

221
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:21,759
survival later on in the

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,519
future um it's fast and it's inexpensive

223
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,439
which is huge like I said you know

224
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,039
cutting down trees and treating with

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,160
insecticides very expensive seed

226
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:34,759
collection very you know comparably

227
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:37,319
cheap um you can do it for a long time

228
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,759
and anyone can do it which is why we are

229
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,560
having this webinar because we would

230
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,240
love for you guys to

231
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,000
help um so as I said this grant has been

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,560
going on for three years last year we

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,720
had a huge season so Ash is am masting

234
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,439
species like Oaks for example which

235
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,639
means that they tend to have sort of a

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,959
mass massive seed production year um so

237
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,639
this is kind of to overwhelm seed

238
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,518
predators and stuff like that you just

239
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,720
put all of your seeds into one year and

240
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,679
that way you make sure that at least

241
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,278
some of them survive seed

242
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,599
Predators um so we collected like crazy

243
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,200
last fall we had a ton of volunteers who

244
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,879
were involved in scouting for us um it

245
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,800
was about 75 80 people who were scouting

246
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,360
for us and then we had 60 folks were

247
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,919
actually making

248
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,480
collections all across New York State

249
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:37,159
um and we New York State uh has divided

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,639
into eight these eight um uh Eco regions

251
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:42,078
so that's how we make sure that we're

252
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,759
kind of um getting a lot of diversity of

253
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,719
different trees growing in different

254
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,759
habitats AC the state so these were you

255
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,680
know evenly dispersed less across the

256
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:57,838
state um and we made

257
00:11:52,679 --> 00:12:01,319
2 last year which was was way above

258
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,279
150 uh um collections for the actual

259
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,720
grant that obligated to do um we had

260
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,679
tons and tons of white ash um you know

261
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,920
that's a very easy species to find U we

262
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,439
had a good amount of green it's a little

263
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,559
harder to find and then we had not too

264
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,000
much black um and I'll talk more about

265
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:24,879
later um Mr gr areas where people don't

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,879
you know go very often

267
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,879
so didn't get too many collections of

268
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,879
those

269
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:37,319
oh hold on a second here we go um so we

270
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,399
were thinking you know wow we they see

271
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,839
this go much we got 223 collections what

272
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,399
can we do this year since it's probably

273
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,360
not going to be another Mass year these

274
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,159
trees have really exhausted themselves

275
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,320
by this huge bumper crop year in

276
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,799
2015 so what we did is we thought about

277
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,278
um you know species that are associated

278
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,159
with Ash so what are the species that

279
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:05,879
are going to for as well once these

280
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:09,120
trees um that dominate The Canopy die um

281
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:11,759
and how can we preserve their genetics

282
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,720
their diversity so we came up with a

283
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,439
list um of species that um were well as

284
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,278
I said were associated with these Ash

285
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,240
forests and we did this primarily by

286
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:26,120
looking at the New York natural heritage

287
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,159
programs um data on ash forests and then

288
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,720
we took out any rare species um any

289
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:35,039
species that has Orthodox seed which

290
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,120
means that um you can't preserve it for

291
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,599
more than a more than a year it has

292
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,839
really high moisture or oil

293
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,839
content and we came up with 22 species

294
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,160
um and I was hoping that today could go

295
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,199
through some of these because they're

296
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,439
you know they're all relatively common

297
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,078
um but we only have an hour for this

298
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,959
webinar so what I'm going to say is if

299
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,638
you have an interest in Plants um and

300
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,719
you think you would like to do some

301
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,519
collections of these associated species

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,440
then get in touch with me um and we can

303
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,480
go through some of the ones you know you

304
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,120
could pick five or or 10 um to kind of

305
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,360
get really really good at identifying

306
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,078
and then um could collect those seeds

307
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,159
and contribute to our seed bank um all

308
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,838
of these plants are um they produce SE

309
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,719
seed in the fall so I've just started

310
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,199
collecting some of them now um it's a

311
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,320
little bit challenged challenging

312
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:35,319
because you have to collect from um a

313
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,160
large population so over 50 plants um

314
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,399
but it's really fun it's a great way to

315
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:42,399
improve your plant ID and like I said

316
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,000
it's it's part of this really um big

317
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,839
growing network of of seed collectors

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,039
working to conserve native CL so it's

319
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,279
important

320
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,120
work um and we were going to focus on

321
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,559
these associated species this year but

322
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,879
then all of a sudden we started getting

323
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,719
reports that blow and behold some ash we

324
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,720
actually still producing

325
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,639
seeds so since that's sort of the focus

326
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,759
of our grant we um we're continue uh

327
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,720
hammering on fraxinus and trying to get

328
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,079
more collections of Ash seed

329
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,759
particularly the green and the black

330
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:23,000
ash um so we need your help um so what I

331
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,360
am going to do then is go through if I

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,159
can advance this

333
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,519
slide is go through um the ident ation

334
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,639
of these three different common species

335
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,639
of Ash that we have in New York state

336
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,959
and what our seed collection protocol is

337
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,399
and in the hopes that some of you might

338
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:44,078
be able to help us

339
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:46,879
out um so this is a white ash um

340
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,239
PRX and I would say this is you know one

341
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,360
of the easier this is the easiest Ash to

342
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,159
identify not only because it's very

343
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,360
common and abundant um but because it

344
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,078
just sort of well maybe I've been

345
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,039
looking at too much Ash but I think it

346
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,479
just sort of jumps out at you uh you

347
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:08,120
often see it along roadsides and in Old

348
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,600
Fields it's more of an Upland species um

349
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,120
you know it inhabits drier soils than

350
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
the other two species that we'll we'll

351
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,799
talk about um but characteristic of the

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,839
ash is it has what what we what we know

353
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,758
as opposite leaves so the leaves

354
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,319
actually come off of the main stem um

355
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,199
opposite one another and there aren't

356
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,879
you know too too many other tree species

357
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,198
that are going to do that um you know

358
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,360
the maples do that um box elder does

359
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,719
that that's actually a maple but you

360
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,199
want to make sure the first thing that

361
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,319
you're looking for is those opposite

362
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,639
opposite leaves and opposite

363
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:46,360
branches and that's a picture of a white

364
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,919
ash there um and White Ash has these

365
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,560
sort of broader leaflets so the those

366
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,879
two things that you're looking at there

367
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:57,559
th that's an entire Leaf um the little

368
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:00,318
leaves coming off are known as leaflets

369
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:04,279
uh which I have pointer

370
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:07,359
um so White Ash has these sort of more

371
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:10,119
rounded chunkier wider leaflets uh

372
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,359
whereas Green Green Ash has more lcal

373
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,599
light thinner um leaflets so that's

374
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,438
really good identifying feature also

375
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,038
White Ash has pale undersides so you

376
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,120
could think white ash white undersides

377
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:27,279
or white ash wide leaflets and then

378
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:31,038
Green Ash is green green all over Green

379
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:35,119
Ash also t kind of glossy Sheen to it I

380
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:38,359
find um a little glossier than the other

381
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:41,119
two and then here is a black ash leaf

382
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,159
which like I said it's black ash is more

383
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,439
difficult to find because it likes you

384
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,080
know sort of wet lenss or it grows a lot

385
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,320
in the Hudson around here in the sort of

386
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,798
the tidal swamp area so it's not like a

387
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,319
white ash or Green Ash where you're

388
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,639
driving along and you're like oh hey

389
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,720
there's there's an ash kind of rare that

390
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,159
you would be able to see a black Dash

391
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,600
that way um so again in these pictures

392
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,080
here the whole thing that you're looking

393
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,599
at is a leaf and those little leaves

394
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:12,240
coming off those are leaflets so with

395
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,959
black ash leaflets are sessile which

396
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,440
means that they just sort of sit right

397
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,960
on that Central stem they don't have a

398
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,000
little teeny stem coming off that

399
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,840
connects them to that Central stem that

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,960
Central stem is called a racus I'm

401
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,038
trying not to to do too much um

402
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,759
botanical terminology so those leaflets

403
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,960
are just sitting right there on the

404
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,440
stem and um I think another another good

405
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,679
way to determine black ashes it also has

406
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,320
this kind of almost flaky bark in

407
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,400
comparison to the other two which have

408
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,720
quite regular grooved uh some people say

409
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,720
diamond shaped

410
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,720
bark

411
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,639
um and then there are other ways which I

412
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,079
don't I don't find as helpful um to

413
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,799
determine the species you can see the

414
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:01,319
black ash twig on the left has a sort of

415
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:04,639
fatter terminal blood Bud some people

416
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,279
call that an ice cone terminal Bud as

417
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
opposed to the Green Ash has smaller

418
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,678
terminal

419
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,880
Bud um then you can also look at uh what

420
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,960
we call Leaf scars so if you pull off a

421
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,960
leaf from a stem that little sort of you

422
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,480
know looks kind of like the shape of a

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,558
smiling mouth uh where you pulled the

424
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,240
leaf off that's the leaf scar um so you

425
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,720
know a lot of characteristics on these

426
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Ash can be very variable and they can

427
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,839
actually often look like they're sort of

428
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,640
somewhere in between two species and

429
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:41,079
I'll talk a little bit about that later

430
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,000
but um with white ash often the the leaf

431
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:47,119
scar looks like this Crescent Moon um so

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,679
I know someone who reminds herself of

433
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,239
that by saying white ash white moon so

434
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,240
remembering the shape of that leaf

435
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,720
scar uh the seeds are another great way

436
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,840
to distinguish between V seeds um and

437
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,120
you would be looking at seeds a lot um

438
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,879
when you get really good you can

439
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,719
determine them you know as you're

440
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,360
driving by at 60 mes per hour the um the

441
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,519
Green Ash are in these like really tight

442
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,240
sort of chunky panicles so the whole

443
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,918
aggregation there is called a

444
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,480
panicle um and Green Ash is that picture

445
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,679
on the left see how it's just really you

446
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,038
know big chunky clump of seeds and the

447
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,480
seeds are are narrower as well um and

448
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,119
more I guess tapered than the White Ash

449
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,000
and then the white ash the picture on

450
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,000
the right are much looser much sper

451
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,360
panicles and then looking at the seed up

452
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,319
close um you can see the differences

453
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,240
between the the Green Ash and the white

454
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,319
ash the green being much narrower and

455
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,798
sort of more elongate and the white ash

456
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,158
with that broader Bas and then the black

457
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,798
ash is totally different it's sort of

458
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,080
most oval

459
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,599
shaped um and the black ash well I'll

460
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,119
get into this later actually getting

461
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,319
ahead of myself here um so let's re just

462
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,239
to quickly review the identification of

463
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,599
those species you remember you want to

464
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,720
straight away look for the opposite

465
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,959
branching um and Ash had these what we

466
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,278
know as compound leaves so I said you

467
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
know the that whole structure was a leaf

468
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,400
and the little things coming off of it

469
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,839
are leaflets so that's a compound leaf

470
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,038
so opposite branching compound leaves

471
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,079
and then you know make sure you're

472
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,079
looking at multiple characteristics so

473
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,359
you can look at the leaf scar or the

474
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,798
buzs look at the seeds and I think that

475
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,479
the habitat um you know the location

476
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:46,158
where you're going to find the species

477
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,919
is really helpful too so as I said white

478
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,520
ash is usually more of an Upland species

479
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,480
um it can be found in an area that gets

480
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,519
you know sort of uh with have a higher

481
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,640
water table and then you'll see white

482
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,240
ash will uh start to you know it's

483
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,360
called Ash yellows we start to get a

484
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,720
little stressed because it likes uh some

485
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,959
drier soils Green Ash is in the middle

486
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,319
you know the soil can be moist it can be

487
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:18,000
dry um and then black ash um really

488
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,439
likes wet wet areas likes wet feet so

489
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,480
it's kind of a spectrum that you have

490
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,880
there okay so moving on to our

491
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,880
collection strategy and

492
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
protocol

493
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,798
sorry I'm having trouble with this

494
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:38,079
clicker there we go um

495
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,278
okay so this is just kind of a an

496
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,278
overview of what we're going to talk

497
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:44,880
about so we've identified the species um

498
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,440
you're going to want to locate monitor

499
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
some good seed trees you know these

500
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,519
could anywhere in your local park or um

501
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
your

502
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,480
backyard um your front yard along the

503
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,200
street you just want to make sure that

504
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,679
it's not a planted tree um good way to

505
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,038
determine that is you know you first of

506
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,000
all you identify that it's one of the

507
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:08,359
Native species it's not an Asian Ash um

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,278
and it's not planted in a row you know

509
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,119
sometimes you'll see an ash tree planted

510
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:16,079
out in the middle um of sort of a a

511
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,199
really neatly Mo um maintained lawn in a

512
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,759
park or something like that it might

513
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,319
be questionable whether that's planted

514
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,839
or not sometimes you can talk to park

515
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,639
staff to confirm that um but you know we

516
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,879
don't want to be Collective

517
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
the seeds and preserving the genetics of

518
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
these trees that have you know

519
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,278
questionable Origins you we don't know

520
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,519
where they come from we want to be

521
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,200
collecting seeds that we know are native

522
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,359
New Yorkers um you know because we care

523
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,720
about our New York

524
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,399
natives um then I'm going to teach you

525
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,960
how to check for seed maturity because

526
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,960
it's important to collect seed at the

527
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,038
right time um make sure they're not too

528
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,159
insect damaged tell you how to show um

529
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,879
fill out the data sheet how to to pick

530
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,520
seeds and how to handle them when you're

531
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,360
done I mentioned before our sort of

532
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,839
General strategy for this this

533
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:10,879
three-year program um was to make 150

534
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,720
Collections and those collections um are

535
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,400
divided supposed to be divided evenly

536
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,278
between those three common species so 50

537
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,240
collections of green 50 of white and 50

538
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:24,960
of black and we exceed those collections

539
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,679
we got 223 however we got you know

540
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,840
something like 150 white uh um 60 green

541
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,759
and then the remainder were black and as

542
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,519
I said that's sort of based upon ease of

543
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,359
of of finding uh since the white is so

544
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:42,398
easy to

545
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,479
observe um and we're trying to get these

546
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:48,278
um trees sort of spread more or less

547
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,960
evenly across these ecro regions that I

548
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,759
mentioned before so you can see the map

549
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,720
on the right is a sort of um finer grade

550
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,919
map of some of the Ecco regions across

551
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,640
New York State these e regions are BAS B

552
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,278
on things like you know climate and soil

553
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,200
type and you know how much it rains um

554
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,759
things like this um and again that's

555
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,919
just to make sure we're capturing the

556
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:16,759
most genetic diversity possible in these

557
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,960
collections so our protocol generally um

558
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,480
you know we're looking for naturally

559
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,919
occurring trees as I said and you want

560
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,519
to make sure your trees are 100 to 300

561
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,840
feet apart so 100 foot minimum between

562
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,519
your trees you if you find Three Trees

563
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,959
sort of in a cluster and they all look

564
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,720
great just make sure they're not super

565
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,038
close because you know it's possible you

566
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,720
could be um collecting from two trees

567
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,278
that are you know connected underground

568
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,839
or something like that we want to make

569
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,720
sure that they're genetically uh as

570
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,918
different and as

571
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,558
possible um you're going to make one

572
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,759
collection per tree so not multiple

573
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,398
collections on One Tree if there's tons

574
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,079
tons of seed just all in one collection

575
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,678
if they seem to be maturing at different

576
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,879
times just all at one

577
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,399
collection then you're going to take a

578
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,679
regular grocery bag you know just one of

579
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,798
those paper bags and it needs to be

580
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,720
filled with at least two to three inches

581
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,200
of seed so it seems like a lot of seed

582
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,159
but generally if Ash is producing seed

583
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,440
you'll have no problem filling it that

584
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,399
high and the paper bags are kind of neat

585
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,278
actually because the first crease line

586
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:29,278
is is pretty much where we want you to

587
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,480
you know it's sort of a minimum fill

588
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,278
line if you

589
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,440
will and then you're going to need to

590
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,278
fill out the sheet um you're going to

591
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,558
get a twig sample and you're gonna have

592
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:39,798
to take a couple of

593
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,200
photos it sort of sounds like a lot but

594
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,679
I promise you it's

595
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,480
not but first you have to know when the

596
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,798
seeds are ready to collect so we're

597
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,720
going to go through a few through a few

598
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,480
images of that um so an ash seed the

599
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,159
whole structure is called a Samara or

600
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,599
samura and they're going to start

601
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,240
maturing very soon so some um as early

602
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,839
as mid-september we found last year and

603
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,038
they can really hang on the tree for a

604
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,918
long time so you know into November we

605
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:12,200
were collecting in and early December

606
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,278
last year and you want to do is you want

607
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,200
to look for a brown seat coat so the

608
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:20,519
seed is actually inside the samur and

609
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,720
the samur helps with dispersal with wind

610
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:26,038
um so these seeds can fly away from

611
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,880
their n tree and a good spot to root and

612
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,679
germinate um and the seeds that drop

613
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,120
early we often get a lot of questions

614
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,679
about this are often damaged so don't

615
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,398
worry about picking them up from the

616
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,759
ground because those are natural

617
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,199
abortions um we want to be picking off

618
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,398
of the tree starting around

619
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,480
mid-september the only exception to that

620
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:49,319
is that black ash seeds don't actually

621
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,960
mature on the tree often they'll drop

622
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,918
off um so you can collect those from the

623
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,519
ground that's that's perfectly fine just

624
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,240
make sure you do these little checks

625
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,120
which I'm going to show you now now to

626
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:06,000
make sure it's um viable feed so you can

627
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:08,359
actually peel off exterior of the ca um

628
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,319
as is shown in these pictures and if you

629
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,798
can look closely on the picture in the

630
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,000
right it's actually

631
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:18,079
revealing um the seed inside that whole

632
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,480
fruit the samur structure and you can

633
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,079
see it has a brown seed coat so that is

634
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,558
key that's what you're looking for that

635
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,960
pale Brown seed coat if you peel it open

636
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,558
and you see that it's green or white or

637
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:36,319
it's shriveled or it's not filling the

638
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:40,119
whole cavity then the seed is either bad

639
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:43,200
or um not yet mature too

640
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,798
early so you want a pale brown seat coat

641
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,798
and you want to make sure it's nice and

642
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,079
plump and

643
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,720
full so here are some good pictures

644
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,278
demonstrating that you can see on the

645
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,480
left that embryo is immature pale green

646
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:59,798
um and then on the right you can see um

647
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,720
a great looking feed coming out of that

648
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:05,158
um samura nice and full and it's also

649
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,960
firm so if it seems a little floppy

650
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,559
again you're probably too early it's a

651
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,919
nice firm with a brown pale brown seat

652
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,720
coat um if you don't have the

653
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,200
fingernails to tear open the samurai you

654
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,720
can also use a razor blade but they're

655
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,640
pretty easy to get open and uh these are

656
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,759
just some more cut tests that show you

657
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,840
what it looks like um inside that samura

658
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:32,158
so on the left there you can see that

659
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:36,439
this really maybe half of its actual

660
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:40,840
mature size so not ready and then there

661
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,840
um on the right um same

662
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,640
thing um here are some very goodlooking

663
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,200
seeds nice and full with those brown

664
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,360
seed

665
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,399
coats and then you also want to look for

666
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,319
insect damage because um this is a major

667
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:04,239
major thing to look for um weevils are a

668
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,839
huge problem um they love Ash seeds um

669
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,159
and you don't want to collect a tree

670
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,038
that's highly infested with weevils

671
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,240
because um you know that seed is not is

672
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,240
not viable it's damaged um so sometimes

673
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,440
you can see that Weevil image on a on a

674
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,798
cut test but you can also just see it on

675
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,919
the

676
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,918
exterior the last

677
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,599
side penetrated

678
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,919
the the fruit to lay an egg and then if

679
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,879
you open it up inside this is pretty

680
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,840
common you can you can see this it's

681
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
it's kind of you'll see there's a little

682
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,079
larvae inside who's munching away on

683
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:44,599
that seed so if you find an ash tree

684
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,839
that has good fruit you know go around

685
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,719
pick some seeds off of each side of the

686
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,038
tree and do an inspection if it seems

687
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,200
like most of the seeds are infested then

688
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,480
just forget it you got a got a bad tree

689
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,840
don't bother collecting from that um you

690
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,960
want to you want a tree where the

691
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:02,319
majority of the fruits are you know nice

692
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,319
and full and not

693
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:09,720
infested Okay so we've identified the

694
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:12,398
tree found a good crop the seeds are

695
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,720
full and mature not damaged the next

696
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,239
thing is to look at the data sheet so

697
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,839
this ash seed collection data sheet I

698
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,679
can either email it to you or you can

699
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:25,638
find it online at

700
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,399
www.ars.org

701
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:30,959
um looks little but I assure you it's

702
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,959
very simple basic stuff like date of

703
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,880
collection what your name is what

704
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,679
species you're collecting from where you

705
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,360
are what the Topography is the most

706
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,559
important thing um is to fill out that

707
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,638
little black box in the top right hand

708
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,000
corner which asks for your collector's

709
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:53,079
ID number and your seed Lot number this

710
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,398
is how we're going to link you and your

711
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:59,519
seed to the actual and this data to the

712
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,719
actual collection of seeds that you make

713
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,159
um so your collector's ID number is be

714
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,798
your last name so my last name is marand

715
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,600
and then the number um collection that

716
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,038
you've made so if you've made one

717
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:16,000
collection it would be marand

718
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:20,679
001 when I make my 100th collection

719
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,440
it'll be marand one Z so that's your ID

720
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,240
number and then the seed Lot number seed

721
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,120
lot ID is Mars B so that's you know just

722
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,200
a way of showing that you are linked to

723
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,278
our project and this information also

724
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,360
has to go on the paper bag that contains

725
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:39,319
the seed just as I said to make sure the

726
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,439
information on that data sheet is always

727
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:46,398
linked to that feed and if you're part

728
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,240
of a group you know if you're um you you

729
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,638
as Master Gardeners get together and you

730
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,000
want to do something for your town you

731
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:55,199
can come up with a unique uh collector's

732
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,839
ID number that's fine and and then it'll

733
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,759
be stored in the bank under your group

734
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,158
name and um you know it ever comes to

735
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,119
the point where you'd like to use some

736
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:09,159
of your seed for you know restoration or

737
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:09,158
whatever you can query based upon that

738
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:17,558
name and there's a picture of the paper

739
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,360
bag that has um claraa my coworker's

740
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:20,960
last name Holmes it's her first

741
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,959
collection so it's

742
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,120
001 and then it's Mars B that's part of

743
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,960
the project that's that she's working

744
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,959
with that's the

745
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,199
lot so in terms of picking the seeds

746
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,278
very easy very straightforward just make

747
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,000
sure they're mature pick them off of the

748
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:39,919
panicle you know you don't need to put

749
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
any other material in the bag because

750
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,759
that could alter the moisture content of

751
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,759
the bag so just strip the seeds right

752
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,440
off um oh you can also toss them into a

753
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,918
tarp sometimes it I've had this

754
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,159
experience where it's been really windy

755
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,399
when you're collecting and you need need

756
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,440
something a little sturdier than a paper

757
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,439
bag because it just flies away you can

758
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,840
put a tarp under the tree um or have you

759
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,639
know a heavier bucket or something

760
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,159
whatever works for you so this is the

761
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,159
minimum fill line that I was talking

762
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,519
about you can see that crease is right

763
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,559
right at three inches so that's at what

764
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,119
we need at least if you want to fill the

765
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,279
whole bag go for

766
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,399
it then you're also going to need a twig

767
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,159
sample and this is for identific

768
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,838
identification purposes we had a few um

769
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,039
specimens last year that it was just

770
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,838
kind of like oh I I know is this green

771
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:34,398
or is this white ash um so taking that

772
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,799
twig sample of it's about six to n

773
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,199
inches long just pull all the leaves off

774
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,960
and Chuck it in the bag with the seeds

775
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,559
um that can help with identification

776
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,720
purposes and it's an important part of

777
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,719
the

778
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,879
collection and then once the twig um and

779
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,799
the seeds have been collected you want

780
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,759
to label your bags um just ignore these

781
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,599
pictures I don't know um we want to make

782
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,560
sure you have your last name and the

783
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,640
number of the collection and then Mars B

784
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,000
um and pulled them down and staple them

785
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,879
make sure the seed doesn't explode

786
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,800
everywhere and then you're going to send

787
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,960
them off to midterm SE bank which is in

788
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,599
Staten Island and we give you that

789
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,960
information when your collection is

790
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,599
ready um and we go over all your data

791
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,838
before we actually send them to the seed

792
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,680
bank um the forest service seed bank in

793
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,920
Georgia and you're also going to need

794
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,000
two photos um one is an up close photo

795
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,000
of the trunk of the tree um again for

796
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,239
identification purposes showing your

797
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,239
seed lot identification number on the

798
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,078
bag and then the other one is going to

799
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,959
be the whole tree and this is to kind of

800
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,320
see the landscape that the tree is a

801
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,760
part of and those those it's easier to

802
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,680
just email those photos to me um like to

803
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,079
do copies but you know you don't have to

804
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,879
go through that whole pull if you don't

805
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,400
want to and once you've picked them um

806
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,400
you know just basic conents don't leave

807
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
them in your car if it's a super hot day

808
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,920
you don't want the seeds to

809
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,358
roast um they want to be you know dry

810
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,159
dryish but remain cool um you know sort

811
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,279
of around 30% humidity if that helps

812
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,598
anyone um you could put them in sort of

813
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,160
a cool cupboard or maybe in your

814
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:23,720
basement if it's dry um after the seeds

815
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:26,920
get shipped to the bank they're um kept

816
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:31,078
in that nice sort of cool um sort of

817
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,159
dryish uh climate um and they're chilled

818
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,119
also to make sure if you missed any

819
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,598
weevils um that the weevils will come

820
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,119
out and build you know stay in that

821
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,119
collection of

822
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,599
seeds um I think I just went over that

823
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,679
yeah um oh and then yeah they're frozen

824
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,280
up very very very cold temperature this

825
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,480
is how they're kept for up to 50 years

826
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,880
is because we essentially

827
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,960
stop any metabolism that's happening and

828
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,000
that seed comes to a halt which is

829
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,960
pretty pretty interesting and all of the

830
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,039
information um about your collections

831
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,240
are recorded in this you know National

832
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,119
Information Network that's called grin

833
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,838
um so you can actually you know look up

834
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,318
your seed and see it there and all that

835
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:24,000
information in the um in that

836
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:28,079
database um so ways that you can help is

837
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
um again um helping us find these these

838
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
trees this fall it's as I said it's a

839
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,639
pretty spotty um seed production year

840
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,760
but we know that they're out there we've

841
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,799
gotten reports particularly from the

842
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,319
southern um and around the Great Lakes

843
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,280
um so we're we're you know we're trying

844
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:47,480
to collect um more Green Ash and more

845
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,880
black ash in particular but you know

846
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,119
we'll take whatever so long as it's a

847
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,480
naturally occurring

848
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,800
tree um if you're interested in

849
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,000
collecting other species um the

850
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
associated species please do reach out

851
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,960
to me

852
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,920
um um I would be happy to as I said go

853
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,280
through and sort of make a smaller list

854
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,400
of species that you could focus on um if

855
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,359
you felt like that was something you

856
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:18,000
wanted to do and my email is ash.

857
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:20,799
Marb gmail.com so

858
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,119
ash.

859
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,760
MSB atgmailcom

860
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,640
um and then there's another project that

861
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,640
also involved in um with multiple

862
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:35,039
partners um we're still kind of coming

863
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:37,400
up with um an informational sort of

864
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,239
Outreach toolkit for it um but we're

865
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,519
working with the New York Botanical

866
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:46,279
Garden and the US Arboretum among others

867
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:48,838
um to try and work on this question of

868
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,440
Ash biogenetics um you know there's not

869
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,880
a whole lot that's known about the

870
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,960
distinction between species um in the

871
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,599
fraxinus genus and the ash genus and so

872
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,800
this project is hoping to sort of take a

873
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,280
finer uh grade closer look at where

874
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,400
those distinctions may be and this is

875
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,240
going to be you know really important

876
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,760
for determining which species are more

877
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,959
susceptible to Emerald ashor and how we

878
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,040
can assure that we're you know

879
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,000
conserving uh that's really important um

880
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,679
genus of trees and for that project we

881
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,838
need citizen scientists to help us make

882
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:29,399
collections of seed and herbarium

883
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:31,679
specimens um so that we can have um

884
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,400
samples for the herbarium but also um

885
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,519
the DNA that we need to look at those

886
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,880
phog gentics so there's a number of

887
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:41,719
different projects that we have on our

888
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,800
plate um we need a lot of help um but I

889
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,318
think it's you know a really fun way to

890
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,280
be involved in native plant conservation

891
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,279
and a really important

892
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:57,000
cause you need more than one as to

893
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:59,639
participate or is one okay yeah one is

894
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,838
all you need can you collect from a tree

895
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:06,519
that's already infected by the emerald

896
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:08,318
as for yes absolutely yeah I mean uh

897
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:11,400
sometimes if you have a really badly

898
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,599
infested tree um it'll put out what's

899
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,760
called a stress crop so it's just kind

900
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,039
of like oh I'm dying I better make a Las

901
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,640
Stitch effort to get my my genes out

902
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:24,800
there um and it try really hard but

903
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,838
those seeds will be kind of shriveled

904
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,640
and empty so if you see that your tree

905
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,920
is infested and it has seeds just make

906
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,598
sure you do that viability check uh if

907
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
they look great we'll take them are

908
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,599
there areas in the state that you are

909
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,160
most interested in having seeds

910
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,599
from uh yeah that's a good question I

911
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:49,559
mean yes we we didn't get that much seed

912
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,480
from the adiron Dex last year but from

913
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,920
what I hear from scouts um there's not

914
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,838
really much going on there um so that's

915
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,800
one area that we we miss missed a little

916
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,400
bit last year um but this year we're

917
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
trying to focus on Lakes Region and

918
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,079
we're hoping that because it does have

919
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,680
such a heavy heavy um density of Ash in

920
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,119
the canopy that we'll be able to find

921
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:14,039
something so you know all sort of along

922
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:16,880
like Buffalo and Rochester along those

923
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,440
that lak Shore um would be great but

924
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,440
anywhere honestly

925
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,318
anywhere all right well if um we don't

926
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,720
have any other questions coming in

927
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,000
either we thank you again for join us

928
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,959
and thanks Molly for for sharing that

929
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,599
information with us and a good luck in

930
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,079
the months

931
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,920
ahead yeah thank you very much laui and

932
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,240
thanks everyone for tuning

933
