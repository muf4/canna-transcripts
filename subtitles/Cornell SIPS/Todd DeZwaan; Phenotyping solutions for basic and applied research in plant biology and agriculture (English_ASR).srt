1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:11,570
so one of the great things about

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,850
high-throughput plant phenotyping is

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,949
from the plant breeding side is we've

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:19,070
been thinking about how to put

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,899
phenotyping for quite a few years but

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,269
plant breeders themselves have been

9
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:27,169
doing phenotyping for the past 10,000

10
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:29,689
years and they've tried to get plants to

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,280
to feed and clothe the world and provide

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,739
food fuel and feed thankfully not all

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,439
lamb breeders evolve at such a slow rate

14
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:41,268
over the past 10,000 years and we

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,299
quickly have realized that there is a

16
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:46,608
lot of tremendous technologies that can

17
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:51,078
be applied through our field of plant

18
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:54,230
breeding and it's in a sense forcing us

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,739
to think more broadly into computer

20
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,238
science engineering robotics and

21
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:02,299
artificial intelligence

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:05,629
so this compose iam I feel isn't just

23
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:07,579
for Plant Sciences themselves but it

24
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:11,060
really is also an opportunity for us to

25
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:16,158
reach out to other departments on campus

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:19,390
and for them to see the value of our

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,280
work and how they can fit into that plan

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,289
so our first talk today is going to be

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:31,099
by Todd Dhawan he is from one of the

30
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:37,090
best phenotyping companies in the world

31
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:39,438
and the title of his presentation is

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,630
phenotyping solutions for basic and

33
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,798
applied research in plant biology and

34
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:47,420
agriculture

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,600
alright so great all right well thank

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,340
you very much and thank you Oh Lina for

37
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,949
the invitation I think we started this

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,259
conversation a couple of months ago or

39
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,750
six weeks or so ago and it's really nice

40
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,069
to be able to follow it up so quickly I

41
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,509
really appreciate that

42
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:06,968
speed speed is so important and

43
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,610
area of endeavor so I'm going to be

44
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:12,068
talking to you about phenotyping

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,810
solutions for poor plant biology and how

46
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:16,179
you can apply them to agricultural

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,939
research applications I'm coming at this

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,560
from the perspective of today being the

49
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,180
business development lead for a

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,759
technology company that's developing

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,420
solutions in this space but my

52
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:30,879
background is prior to that I spent 11

53
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,399
years working with Monsanto and

54
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,829
specifically my my last role with

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,409
Monsanto before I left the company in

56
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,049
September was a strategy lead for a

57
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,449
precision phenotyping system that they

58
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,400
had developed that they constructed in

59
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,348
Research Triangle Park and prior to that

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,659
was working with paradigm genetics and

61
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:52,000
we were working on what we call the gene

62
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:55,509
function Factory in Arabidopsis between

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,889
2000 and 2005 where we were doing a lot

64
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:01,090
of high-throughput phenotyping and

65
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:03,159
Arabidopsis so while I'm pitching a

66
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,430
product if that's the right thing to say

67
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,469
today while I'm here representing Lemna

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,139
tech I'm also I also have a pretty

69
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,500
expensive background in the in the

70
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:17,079
application side of things so I'll start

71
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,629
out a little bit just echoing what Mike

72
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:21,040
said about the history and talk a little

73
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,370
bit about the challenges coming

74
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,959
primarily from the genomic side of

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,569
things won't talk too much about the

76
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,969
environment but of course G by E is

77
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:34,238
crucial to anything that you do in the

78
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,269
phenotyping space and then I'll shift

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
from there and talk a little bit about

80
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,889
technologies that we're developing at

81
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,409
Lemna tech and and how they address some

82
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:51,489
of the solutions to those challenges

83
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:54,900
that we're facing as as researchers so

84
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,519
just to echo what Mike said we have been

85
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,980
phenotyping for 10,000 years actually

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,810
phenotyping was one of the key things

87
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:06,608
that came out of the Neolithic

88
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:11,680
Revolution as we domesticated species so

89
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:14,950
as a as a dog lover and as a

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,079
- or an occasional homebrewer of beer

91
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:18,579
fermentation and domestication of

92
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,060
animals also came out of the Neolithic

93
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,110
Revolution so I feel like dog lovers

94
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,449
beer brewing and phenotyping should all

95
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:32,229
coincide as an appreciation for what

96
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,410
Neolithic man gave us today but you know

97
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:36,550
it's really impressive when we look at

98
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,550
when we look at the history of

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,370
phenotyping over the last nine thousand

100
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,329
years when you consider what teosinte is

101
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,970
and what it has become with with field

102
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:52,779
corn today but what's even more

103
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,570
impressive is that is that that idea of

104
00:04:52,779 --> 00:05:00,848
speed has and how that has accelerated

105
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:04,168
in the last 50 to 75 years so if you

106
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:08,259
look at breeding gained gains in in corn

107
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:11,649
for example if you look at where we were

108
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:15,430
back and around 1920 before the advent

109
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:18,219
of hybridization in corn it took a land

110
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,848
area about the equivalent of a half

111
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:27,539
quart of basketball court to produce one

112
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:30,129
bushel of corn through hybridization and

113
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:32,439
impressive gain impressive gains and

114
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,959
yield through breeding and then with the

115
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,589
advent of biotechnology in the late 90s

116
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,689
which really diddled has done a lot to

117
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:46,689
protect those breeding gains on corn

118
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:49,649
acreage today we are at about a land

119
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:53,288
area equivalent for a bushel of corn

120
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,359
that is equivalent to the space within

121
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:57,129
the free-throw Lane so between the

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,530
free-throw line and the out of bounds

123
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,839
that's about how much land area it takes

124
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:04,929
to produce bushel corn today so think

125
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:08,198
about that reduction in space and what

126
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,939
that's and the impact that that's the

127
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,720
positive impact that that's really had

128
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:16,149
on productivity and ability to to use a

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,699
land as we feed a growing population and

130
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,519
we're projected to get even to produce

131
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,220
uneven produce an equivalent bushel on

132
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,589
even

133
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,210
take courage as we move forward so

134
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,879
Mendel is considered the father of

135
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:34,699
genetics I think he's also foundational

136
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,790
in phenotyping and we can really trace

137
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,579
our ideas of phenotyping and features

138
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:44,060
that we're characterizing in plant

139
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:46,819
growth and development back to that of

140
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,920
those observational studies that that

141
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:53,300
Mendel had with peas and everything that

142
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,590
everything that he was looking at

143
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,689
genetically he was describing as as a

144
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:03,649
phenotype so phenotype is really

145
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:06,310
critical for explaining genetic outcomes

146
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:09,500
and no matter how we modify the genome

147
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,259
the desired outcome always occurs at the

148
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,189
level of the phenome so whether you're

149
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,829
whether you're looking at traditional

150
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,379
breeding outcomes like Mendel was doing

151
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,819
or whether you're looking at

152
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:23,060
non-mendelian inheritance through

153
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,680
epigenetics or other types of

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,780
modification through proto flap

155
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,340
protoplast fusion or mutagenesis

156
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,349
transgenesis polyploidy and just

157
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,199
recently we there have been a number of

158
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,050
products that have been released on the

159
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,029
market that are that are the first

160
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,509
generation products of gene editing so

161
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:47,359
the Browning resistant mushrooms is one

162
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,759
example of that so no matter how we

163
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,189
modify the genome we always want to see

164
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,069
what's happening at the at the level of

165
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:59,000
the phenome and the ability to modify

166
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:02,439
the genome the precision with which we

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,699
can modify the phenome the cost of

168
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:11,120
modifying the genome these are all these

169
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,250
are all becoming more and more these

170
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,790
you're all making genome modification

171
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,709
more and more accessible so not only

172
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,729
industry but also plant biology

173
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,889
researchers and and so the scale of

174
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:27,680
genome modification is increasing so

175
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:30,339
this is just reflecting some some graphs

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,450
and that I'm sure all of you have seen

177
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,028
that all of you have seen over the

178
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,469
recent

179
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:40,288
decade but the cost of sequencing

180
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:43,050
actually is moving faster than the

181
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:47,759
decrease in cost of computational power

182
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,979
by by Moore's law so we're three billion

183
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,259
dollars was spent to sequence the human

184
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,149
genome in the late 90s you can now do it

185
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,839
for about a thousand which is pretty

186
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,448
incredible

187
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,449
and as genome sequencing costs go down

188
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:02,789
of course the amount of sequencing data

189
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:04,409
that we accumulate increases so we're up

190
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:09,688
to the hundreds of trillions of base

191
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:12,389
pairs in GenBank today and similarly as

192
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:15,149
the cost of sequencing goes down at

193
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:18,000
Jason technologies like gene synthesis

194
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,938
are also coming down so all of this is

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,589
pointing to our ability to accelerate

196
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:28,679
genome modification and the real demand

197
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,829
to meet that to meet that acceleration

198
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,688
and genome modification with

199
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:39,359
corresponding increases and advancements

200
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:42,629
in genomics technology so I want to talk

201
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,000
a little bit about that and I put this

202
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:47,308
slide together sort of to editorialize

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,500
some ideas that I've been thinking about

204
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:51,269
over the past six months since I've been

205
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,370
with Lemna tech and I've been talking to

206
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:55,769
customers and I've been talking to

207
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:00,659
people in the US and Western Europe

208
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:05,009
about the about the about sort of the

209
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:09,629
state of where academia and industry are

210
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:13,050
with phenotyping and I tried to do sort

211
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:17,100
of a manual Spotfire Tory type view of

212
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:19,828
the of my of my thinking on this but I

213
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,319
want to I want to first talk about first

214
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,688
talk about the size of these bubbles

215
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:28,558
that I'm showing on the scratch on this

216
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:30,599
slide and the size is what I've done is

217
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:33,629
really kind of taken size to represent

218
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,308
utility and one of the things that I

219
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:39,659
hear a lot when I talk to people about

220
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:41,669
phenotyping is a lot of interest that

221
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,850
you know almost one of the first things

222
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:45,879
that that that come up our interest

223
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,170
areas in

224
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,700
these smaller bubbles the NIR infrared

225
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:54,669
chlorophyll fluorescence fluorescence in

226
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,100
general as a phenotyping technology but

227
00:10:54,669 --> 00:11:00,789
what I what I will say is in my

228
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:06,070
experience and in and what real-world

229
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:10,949
needs really is about 80 to 85% of the

230
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,590
questions that you ask will rely on

231
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,060
high-resolution reliable repeatable

232
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,310
visible light imaging that's always

233
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:21,719
going to be the cornerstone of your

234
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:24,429
phenotyping of your phenotyping inquiry

235
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,160
there have been some really impressive

236
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:29,859
there have been some really impressive

237
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:33,399
advances in technology and capabilities

238
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:37,090
in the last decade or two 3d laser

239
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:42,129
scanning is another really useful tool

240
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:44,170
in for phenotyping it it uses it uses a

241
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:45,789
laser based approach to give you a very

242
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,979
detailed three-dimensional

243
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:51,579
reconstruction of the plants that you're

244
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,980
using and I'll talk about this now I may

245
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,930
repeat it again later but one of the

246
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,379
really powerful things that 3d laser

247
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:04,989
scanning brings to phenotyping is its

248
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:06,820
ability to make to make it bring

249
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,430
information forward from some of these

250
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,610
other from other these some of these

251
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:15,039
other systems so at Lemna Tech we use

252
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,460
data analytical approach called sensor

253
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:21,279
fusion where we take the 3d image of a

254
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,170
3d laser scan and overlay it on the 2d

255
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,909
images that are produced through for

256
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:28,120
example a chlorophyll fluorescence

257
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:32,379
system or an NIR system and what that

258
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:36,549
does is it it corrects for many of the

259
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:39,429
angle effects and confusion frankly in

260
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:41,609
the data that you get from a strictly 2d

261
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:46,479
image alone from some of these other

262
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:49,269
modalities so so 3d laser scanning has

263
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,460
has very high utility and then finally

264
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,210
hyperspectral is just there's a lot of

265
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,960
really exciting things happening

266
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:59,450
with hyperspectral imaging so from field

267
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,120
scanning using hyperspectral to do

268
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:07,070
scouting early detection of disease as

269
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,740
well as taking it into the laboratory

270
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,420
context so there's a group out of the

271
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,799
University of Bonn who's using hyper

272
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:18,559
spectral imaging to study metabolic and

273
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:21,109
and other chemical compositional changes

274
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,729
in plants so there's a lot of real

275
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,070
discovery phase things that are

276
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,149
happening with with hyper spectral

277
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,610
imaging now these days so that's the

278
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:33,649
size of the bubble and then the and then

279
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,080
as you're thinking about cost and these

280
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,329
this is all very subjective so working

281
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,100
in tens of thousands and you know we're

282
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,129
working in orders of magnitude not

283
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,279
specific numbers here but in terms of

284
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,840
cost visible light phenotyping is by far

285
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,939
going to be sort of your entry level

286
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,790
solution for coming in in the five to

287
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,690
twenty thousand dollar range for a very

288
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:02,899
nice instrumentation then laser scanning

289
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,680
you start getting up into you know the

290
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,509
ten to seventy thousand dollar range and

291
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,429
it's very easy to spend over a hundred

292
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:13,299
thousand dollars on hyper spectral on

293
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,529
high-end hyperspectral camera cameras so

294
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,259
just some things to keep in mind as

295
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,809
you're thinking about developing

296
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:23,689
phenotyping solutions I think more than

297
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,879
anything think about the kinds of

298
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,500
questions that you're asking now and

299
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,929
thinking think about the growth

300
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,110
potential of the system so how you can

301
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:35,899
how you can build on it as your as your

302
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,639
needs change going forward so I'm going

303
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:40,459
to take this and take some of these

304
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,110
ideas and talk about I think just given

305
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,820
the time I'll probably talk a little bit

306
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,980
about visible light imaging how we're

307
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,410
using it as some of the tools we've

308
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,830
developed at Lema tech show you how

309
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,539
we're using laser scanning and then talk

310
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,550
about a new instrument that we've

311
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:57,169
developed for hyperspectral imaging and

312
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:01,669
then see where we are

313
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:03,169
jump to the end so as I said visible

314
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,719
light imaging is really the cornerstone

315
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:08,088
of any phenotyping

316
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,100
system that you that you put in place

317
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,649
visible light imaging is going to

318
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,670
deliver the information that you need

319
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,730
for plant size plant architecture color

320
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:21,438
and if it's a very high quality system

321
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,269
you can get a very high degree of

322
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:26,208
temporal resolution so you can start

323
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,970
looking at change over time and then you

324
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,559
can use analytical solutions that I

325
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,420
think Chris will talk to you more about

326
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,739
to to do things like looking at

327
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,099
skeletonization to define leaf number

328
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,649
leaf length angles stem length

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:47,600
elongation rates change over time you

330
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:50,028
can you can use color to quantify very

331
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,750
specific features so you can get and you

332
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:58,220
can get an early view of damage either

333
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,759
due to herbicide or disease or or

334
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,649
abiotic stress whatever your question is

335
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,300
using using color and you can correlate

336
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:09,230
some of those color changes with

337
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:11,659
specific with specific responses so for

338
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,399
example you get a very different color

339
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,019
response in a rapid ops a Sun or

340
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,789
nitrogen stress than you do drought

341
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:23,209
stress you can extend it further beyond

342
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:24,679
plants to do to to insect feeding assay

343
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,768
so this is something that a number of

344
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,198
our industrial partners use our systems

345
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,620
for they use it for insects feeding

346
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:35,750
assays with dietary plates or even leaf

347
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,149
disks and then finally you can use

348
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,929
visible light imaging to get a lot of

349
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:45,708
information around around post-harvest

350
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:50,388
questions so looking at things like at

351
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:52,448
your metrics tip void kernel kahut doing

352
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,909
an estimate of total kernel count

353
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:58,669
individual seed metrics you can get

354
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:00,469
information about color and some

355
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:04,129
compositional features based on how

356
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:08,568
color how color changes over the course

357
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,480
over the dimensions of the seed so

358
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:15,379
essentially all of our systems whether

359
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,538
it's a laboratory field or greenhouse

360
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,470
system are all going to have visible

361
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:21,640
light imaging

362
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,828
as the foundation of the instrumentation

363
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm just showing three examples of some

364
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:32,168
of our instruments here so on the left

365
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:34,548
here this is a this is a manual

366
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,280
individual plant phenotyping system

367
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:39,529
actually you can also do flats in the

368
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,609
top down version of this of this

369
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:44,720
instrument so you could do multiple

370
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:46,428
plants but it's essentially used it's a

371
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,288
it's an entry level system that's used

372
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,590
for low throughput phenotyping of

373
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:53,658
individual flats or plants it's got its

374
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:56,689
a standalone system with touchscreen

375
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:59,110
touchscreen control that also allows you

376
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,000
to do on-the-fly data visualization and

377
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:04,219
it's available as I'm showing here for

378
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,038
top-down view but we also have a short

379
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,460
wide one that's that you can use for

380
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:13,940
side view so if you're looking at taller

381
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,750
plants and especially for monocot softn

382
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,000
you want to have that side view imaging

383
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,679
up here at the top is that is a new

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,730
system that we're developing this year

385
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:29,530
it's it's really kind of a thing covet

386
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,269
as sort of a kind as a as an entry-level

387
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:35,119
automated phenotyping solution so you

388
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:38,658
can buy the the base unit that you see

389
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,699
here with only visible light imaging and

390
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:44,570
you can start immediately doing high

391
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,150
throughput phenotyping of flats of

392
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:51,769
plants or microtiter plates or whatever

393
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:55,580
your whatever your research area it

394
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:57,500
calls for and you can you can then it's

395
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:59,029
modular in the sense that you can start

396
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,190
adding on a tray feeder if your

397
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,349
throughput increases you can also add on

398
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,570
other imaging units if your imaging

399
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:08,089
demands increase so that you can start

400
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:10,609
expanding beyond visible light into

401
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:13,668
things like chlorophyll fluorescence or

402
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:16,089
hyperspectral and then finally down here

403
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,799
is just a picture of conveyor system

404
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:21,678
again visible light is part of all of

405
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,690
those systems and these systems are

406
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,110
larger greenhouse installations that

407
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,830
have fully integrated growth and plant

408
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:31,298
growth and they

409
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:34,009
it's and watering and so forth in them

410
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:37,429
3d laser scanning the way this works is

411
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:40,308
you use a laser to generate a point

412
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,048
cloud and so those point clouds identify

413
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:44,690
very specific features and you can do

414
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:47,509
this at a high degree of resolution and

415
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,720
use machine learning type of perches to

416
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:52,960
take those features that you're

417
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,808
extracting via the point clouds and

418
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,298
start using machine learning to identify

419
00:19:55,808 --> 00:20:04,009
specific organ level features panicles

420
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:07,879
leaves things like that on the plant we

421
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:09,859
have so I just want to give you an

422
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,528
example of how we're using 3d laser

423
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:15,558
scanning in our field scan eliezer

424
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:18,528
system so this is a system that is at

425
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:22,668
the at University of Arizona Maricopa

426
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:26,659
field site and this is part of the Terra

427
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:28,970
reference project and a major focus of

428
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,130
this project is accelerating breeding in

429
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,038
bioenergy

430
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:36,289
sorghum for a to produce bioenergy

431
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,179
circum as a commodity crop for the

432
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:42,230
southeastern region of the United States

433
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:44,929
and we have many sensors within the

434
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,700
sensor box that we use at the Maricopa

435
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:52,130
site laser scanners are are an important

436
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,080
part of this and as I said before what

437
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,080
the laser scanners allow us to do is

438
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,089
that sensor fusion approach by coupling

439
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,319
the 3d view that we generate from laser

440
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:08,839
scanning with the 2d views of infrared

441
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:11,028
ps2 and hyper spec what I just want to

442
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,038
show here is a view of what that looks

443
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:15,740
like so this is data that was actually

444
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,589
captured over time from the Maricopa

445
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,269
field site and there's a couple of

446
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,428
things that I want to point out with

447
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:25,759
this first of all we're getting to the

448
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:28,009
point with with laser scanning and 3d

449
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,829
imaging with laser scanning that from a

450
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:33,349
gantry system we can singulate plan so

451
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,349
this was overtime and we were able to

452
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:38,719
monitor the growth of

453
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:41,480
these sets of plants individually over

454
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,110
time now the other thing that you can

455
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,750
see is the lasers the 3d images give you

456
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:49,369
a very that you can start seeing very

457
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,009
distinct architectural differences

458
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:54,769
between these two plots so let's just

459
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:58,009
focus on an easy one you can see that

460
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:00,319
there's very very different panicle

461
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,730
density between the one on the left and

462
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,000
the one on the right so that you can

463
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,038
start identifying very specific features

464
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,679
one of the things that we're working on

465
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,779
is to try to get laser scanning the load

466
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,600
try trying to get further down into the

467
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,339
canopy so while those are two of the

468
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,769
strengths one of the drawbacks is with

469
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:21,619
3d laser scanning from a gantry you

470
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:27,168
really get only the top half 2/3 of the

471
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:29,359
plant in that 3d view so I won't spend

472
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,400
too much time talking about specific

473
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,000
indices with hyperspectral imaging

474
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,190
except to say that there are there are a

475
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,369
wide variety of indices that are being

476
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,230
developed using hyper spectral imaging

477
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:46,038
everything from NDVI

478
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:49,429
for for remote imaging of fields and

479
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:52,129
forests to specific indices that measure

480
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,919
things like water chlorophyll and and

481
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,169
stress pigment composition so there's a

482
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,509
lot of discovery potential with with

483
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:02,570
hyper spec and I think that there's a

484
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:04,548
lot there's going to be a lot more a lot

485
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:06,859
more knowledge to be gained using high

486
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:11,150
perspective in the years ahead we've

487
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:13,639
recently developed a robotic unit that

488
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:17,929
will allow us to use hyperspectral

489
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:21,950
combined with the 3d laser to to get to

490
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:23,750
translate very complex plant structural

491
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,830
level information into a very

492
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:32,558
high-resolution 3d model and so this is

493
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:34,759
a this is a robot it's it's got an

494
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:38,779
articulating arm that's got

495
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:42,169
hyperspectral 3d laser scanner and then

496
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:43,548
two lights that focus into a line and

497
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:44,920
you're basically doing all of your

498
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,980
imaging and aligned

499
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,019
across the the plant so if the

500
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,120
microphone here is the plant you can

501
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,190
very easily scan up with the robot and

502
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,039
then the articulating arm comes down and

503
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:02,860
it generates a very high resolution in

504
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:05,740
three dimensions that way I think that

505
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,959
I'm going to jump through these next

506
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,420
couple of slides because there was one

507
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,980
point that I thought was worth talking

508
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,110
about with this audience and I'm coming

509
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:19,150
up on time here so Lemna Tech produces

510
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:20,500
when we're looking at greenhouse when

511
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,550
we're looking at greenhouse level

512
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,380
solutions for phenotyping Lemna Tech

513
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,169
really delivers green greenhouse

514
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,880
phenotyping solutions based on that are

515
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,900
tailored to a research institutions

516
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,120
demand and so at the number Nebraska

517
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,560
innovation campus we have a conveyor

518
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:43,809
based greenhouse system and we recently

519
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,750
completed at the Cranfield agricultural

520
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:51,059
engineering precision Innovation Center

521
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:54,099
a gantry based system and there are

522
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,659
there are a number of pros and cons to

523
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:57,250
either of these systems that I think are

524
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,620
worth evaluating as you're thinking

525
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:03,369
about building out infrastructure in

526
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:05,889
this way so conveyor based systems have

527
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:07,869
been around for quite a number of years

528
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,270
and in many respects they're very tried

529
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:14,289
and true way of doing high throughput

530
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:17,589
Venis I think but some of the drawbacks

531
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:19,480
of a conveyor system are that you have

532
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:21,759
lower size and weight limits because of

533
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,920
the intrinsic limits of the conveyor and

534
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,809
also the interns equipments of the

535
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,300
cabinets that you're bringing the plants

536
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:33,009
through in contrast a gantry system

537
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,529
because the plants don't have to move

538
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:38,829
but they you're bringing the sensor to

539
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:41,950
the plants in a gantry system you can

540
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:44,169
basically phenotype large plants all the

541
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,870
way out to maturity so if you're asking

542
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,330
questions of corn out to v7 then maybe a

543
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:51,159
conveyor then there may be a conveyor

544
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,079
system is what you want but if you

545
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,420
really want to start asking reproductive

546
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,129
stage questions around corn in a

547
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,440
controlled environment a gantry system

548
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,950
it's probably the solution that you're

549
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,259
looking for

550
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,269
conveyor systems as I said when we were

551
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:09,980
talking about 3d imaging with the gantry

552
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,940
conveyor systems will give you a

553
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:17,960
high-resolution whole plant imaging the

554
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:21,798
the gantry system will be relying on 3d

555
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,470
3d reconstructions and so there you're

556
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,879
getting down to about halfway down the

557
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,679
plant but you won't be able to get all

558
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,240
the way down to the pot now there are

559
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,048
some solutions that you could consider

560
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,759
with sort of imaging within the rows of

561
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:37,879
a gantry system to supplement your

562
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,140
gantry but from the gantry itself you're

563
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,490
not going to be able to get the entire

564
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,530
plant however with a conveyor system

565
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,929
while you're doing plant level tracking

566
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:51,440
and analysis which can be very important

567
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:54,169
for basic for basic research the gantry

568
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,740
system will allow you to do canopy level

569
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,690
analysis so if you're asking for how

570
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,529
things translate more into a field

571
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,429
context the gantry system may be maybe

572
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:07,579
the way to go

573
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:10,850
the conveyor system as I'm trying to

574
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:14,509
communicate down here with this graph is

575
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:17,928
a fixed configuration so there is some

576
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:20,658
variation in how you how you can

577
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,850
populate the greenhouse with a conveyor

578
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:25,100
system but in general your pots are

579
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,230
always going to be this far apart so you

580
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:29,779
could populate it with every other pot

581
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:32,360
or you can change your pots so that

582
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,099
there's multiple plants within a carrier

583
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,928
but there's all they're always going to

584
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:40,099
be in this configuration that's defined

585
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:42,470
by the conveyor a gantry system it's

586
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,178
wide open so you can configure the floor

587
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,600
of the greenhouse however you want with

588
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:50,750
the gantry so there's a lot of a lot of

589
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,939
opportunity there however with the

590
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,579
conveyor system the movement really

591
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,429
mitigates any environmental variation

592
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:59,569
that will occur in any greenhouse so no

593
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:01,490
matter how good your greenhouse is

594
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:03,740
there's always going to be environmental

595
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,089
variation and you'll need to take that

596
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,859
into consideration with your

597
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:11,619
experimental design

598
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:11,619
with a convey with a gantry system and

599
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:18,289
yeah one one real quick one another real

600
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:21,289
quick point in cases where moving your

601
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:23,990
plant can influence the outcome of the

602
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:26,149
phenotype obviously a conveyor gantry

603
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,490
system is going to be a better choice so

604
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,620
a real clear example of that is thermal

605
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,359
imaging if you want to do anything with

606
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,969
thermal imaging as soon as you move the

607
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:37,219
plant on a conveyor you immediately

608
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,350
disrupt your ability to do that in a

609
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,559
biologically relevant way you'll get

610
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:48,049
data but whether its interpretive all or

611
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:51,440
meaningful so we all we provide all of

612
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:52,970
the software for for all of the all of

613
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,900
the instrumentation that I just

614
00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,079
described and I also want to give a

615
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,360
shout out here to the plant CV software

616
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,419
which really is it's an open-source

617
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,819
software solution that overlaps a lot

618
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,180
with some of the things that we do with

619
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:13,129
Lemna grid and there's a lot of really

620
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,560
exciting things happening with with

621
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:20,480
plant cv these days in the plant

622
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:25,069
community I think I'll I'll jump to the

623
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,000
end here and just open it up to some

624
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:30,679
final questions so just to summarize

625
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,190
phenotyping really follows on genotyping

626
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:37,240
it's it's crucial that we we develop

627
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,490
tools to address this challenge as we

628
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,650
become more capable in our ability to

629
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,519
genotype and make genome modifications

630
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:48,740
and Lemna tech delivers solutions at a

631
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,650
variety of scales laboratory greenhouse

632
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,130
and fields to do just that so with that

633
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,130
olá

634
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,499
[Applause]

635
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:25,920
yeah the robot moves around the plant so

636
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:29,250
there's not a need for the plant to

637
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,460
rotate that way now in the cabinets that

638
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,710
I showed on the conveyer system actually

639
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,809
if you looked at that particular image

640
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,450
there's as the plant moves into those

641
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:42,990
cabinets that it moves on to a stage

642
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:45,240
that it lifts it and that rotates so

643
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,730
then you can from a pick from fixed

644
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,410
cameras you can get multiple angle you

645
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,410
can get a variety of different angle yes

646
00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:00,289
so on the robot on the robot there will

647
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,409
be is the plant this is the robot I'm

648
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:08,170
the robot there will be one camera that

649
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:13,519
moves around like that in the cabinets

650
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:17,660
there's two cameras maybe three but the

651
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,359
plant moves so in the cat in the cabinet

652
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,850
configuration so that's what I mean

653
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,649
that's a higher throughput so that that

654
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:26,209
kind of solution in the cabinet where

655
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:31,910
you have that's a higher throughput

656
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:34,970
lower resolution solution to to the to

657
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,620
the problem the robot is specifically a

658
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:44,420
solution we're developing it's lower

659
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:48,679
throughput but higher resolution so I'm

660
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:50,960
the robot well it'll depend on with the

661
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,049
question you're asking but you can

662
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,480
easily you can easily test a green house

663
00:31:54,049 --> 00:32:01,659
if you take a conveyor grease you can

664
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,660
easily test a green house of 500 or even

665
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:10,789
even the thousand or 2,000 plants in a

666
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,490
day through visible visible light

667
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:16,009
imaging with that hype with the robotic

668
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,170
unit that's going to be like five to ten

669
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:20,240
that can be a high perspex lows

670
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,000
everything down no matter whether it's

671
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,470
on a robot or around six mounted high

672
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,049
perspex allows everything down because

673
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,269
you're looking at multiple wave you're

674
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:32,000
capturing multiple wavelengths that will

675
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:35,509
be that is probably going to be five to

676
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,059
ten minutes to plant depending on the

677
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,579
type of scan that you do so but you can

678
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:43,869
do you can get high throughput you can

679
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,869
test an entire green ounce

680
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,790
from an educational standpoint as we

681
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:04,730
kind of graduate sees what are the

682
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:04,730
skills that your company most values

683
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:14,279
great question that's a really great

684
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:18,539
question so so the data analytics the

685
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:21,000
data analytics piece developing

686
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:24,960
developing the computational tools for

687
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,220
handling handling the the massive

688
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,150
amounts of information that we're

689
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,529
generating so that gantry system Chris

690
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,590
might actually be able to answer that

691
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:37,619
it's generating terabytes of data per

692
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:40,230
day yeah I mean it's just you know an

693
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:45,569
enormous so the data data analytics

694
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:48,480
piece there's really really important to

695
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:50,899
be able to take the biological know how

696
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,370
I'm bridge it with the instrumentation

697
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,650
that's a that's a that's a really

698
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:59,369
crucial piece so understanding what the

699
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,190
what the strengths weaknesses limits are

700
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,719
of the image of the sensor

701
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:08,400
instrumentation that's that that's out

702
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,170
there is is really crucial and I'll

703
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,369
think about that some more and be ready

704
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:23,159
to talk to grad students at their break

705
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:25,619
it's a great question this has been a

706
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:30,409
production of Cornell University on the

707
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:30,409
web at Cornell edu
