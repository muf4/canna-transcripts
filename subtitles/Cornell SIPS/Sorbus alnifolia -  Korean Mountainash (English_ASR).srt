00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:11,599
this is a small tree with distinctively

veined leaves that almost look embossed

they have purple fruits in the fall

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,239
and a distinctive feature for me is the

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
bark which has almost

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,839
lines uh dashes and dots lines on the

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,118
bark

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:29,359
