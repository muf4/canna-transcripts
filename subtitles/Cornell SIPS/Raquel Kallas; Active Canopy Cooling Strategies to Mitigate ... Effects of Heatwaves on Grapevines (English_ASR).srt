1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,750
yeah I'm sorry I kind of like trailed

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,070
off with my drear updates I think I

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,559
posted too but they were pretty

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,019
comprehensive but then I just fell into

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,539
a hole of insanity because we had a

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,769
really really busy er and hopefully this

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,289
makes up for it and you can hear about

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:26,789
everything I did between the last step

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,769
say that now so um as was said I went to

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,109
Australia to pursue my interests in

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,960
grapes wine and really relations to

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,700
climate change and there will be lots of

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,308
animal pictures in this presentation

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,149
because I love animals and there's lots

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:44,820
of cool ones in Australia so before I

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,500
get into like the nitty-gritty academic

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,689
stuff I thought I'd give you some fun

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,198
background about other things I learned

21
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,939
in Australia not related to viticulture

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,979
perhaps the scariest was how to drive a

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,689
manual car on the wrong side of the road

24
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:59,968
that was terrifying

25
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,439
I am now trying to readjust to the right

26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,040
side of the road so it's always a

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,798
struggle how to live involuntarily with

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,479
very large spiders that are very fast

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,830
they're called Huntsman because they run

30
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,688
after their prey and they don't build

31
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:18,090
webs so they are just gone like that I

32
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:19,500
did play one game of cricket I was told

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,909
I did a good job I don't really

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,890
understand the rules but they told me

35
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,859
what to do and I did it so I played

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,329
cricket check and how to understand

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,368
Australians what the heck are they

38
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,239
saying if you can abbreviate a word they

39
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:32,129
will abbreviate it

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,679
if you can't abbreviate a word they will

41
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,728
still managed to abbreviate it and yeah

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,740
it's like a completely different

43
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:43,379
language so that was interesting so I

44
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,658
went to Australia as we know here is a

45
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,539
map showing you the wine regions of

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,689
Australia pretty big continent lots of

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:58,049
wine regions I was based right oh no

48
00:01:53,688 --> 00:02:00,688
sorry no laser anyway I was based right

49
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,329
here in this green area South Australia

50
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,359
which is actually producing more than

51
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:09,959
50% of Australian wine so it's the

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,789
largest production area I was right here

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,110
in the middle of all this at the

54
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,150
University of Adelaide

55
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,120
smack in the middle of the wine regions

56
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,670
of South Australia and we had research

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,700
projects up in the Riverland which is

58
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:26,699
that yellow squarish area to the

59
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,560
northeast which is very hot very

60
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:33,729
intensive agriculture high yielding

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,099
vines and we had research sites down in

62
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:38,879
the southeast in awara which is in

63
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,919
that orange region it's a cooler climate

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,569
and of course we had work at the

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,619
University vineyard in the middle where

66
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:49,719
the stars one interesting thing about

67
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,340
South Australia is it's a quarantine

68
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,719
area for Phil Ochs row so there are no

69
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,400
Phil Ochs are there meaning that has

70
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,949
some of the oldest find in the world

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,810
lots of undrafted vines people still

72
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,819
grab her other reasons but it's pretty

73
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:05,199
cool to work alongside hundreds of year

74
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:08,650
old vines there and so I was working

75
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,079
with dr. Vinay Peggy who many some of

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,539
you here might be familiar with

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
absolutely incredible guy his wife Fran

78
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,019
who was an amazing friend to me while I

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,939
was there and the rest of his lab who

80
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,909
are all wonderful people from all around

81
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:26,439
the world and I had just an incredible

82
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:28,479
experience with them so I'll kind of

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,250
break down for you what I did this year

84
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,689
because the drear award was only

85
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,909
supposed to be for the first half of the

86
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,319
year but I was there until last week so

87
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:38,319
I pretty much had a full year in

88
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,109
Australia and I'll explain to you what

89
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,389
that consisted of so in their summer

90
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,540
fall which is our winter spring here I

91
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,419
was doing the jury reward had a lab

92
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:52,000
intern so just participating in all of

93
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,039
his research projects all over the state

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,530
of South Australia collecting data

95
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,650
analyzing data preparing publications

96
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,140
you name it and I also had a part-time

97
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,050
job with the a WRI which is the

98
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,609
Australian wine Research Institute so on

99
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,370
the weekends during harvest I was

100
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,800
working for them I was making small lot

101
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,750
research wines applying treatments

102
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,790
basically seeing the wines through from

103
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,500
grapes to bottle so that was a really

104
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,689
great experience for me because it added

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,290
to my overall knowledge base of

106
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,290
viticulture and enology

107
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,129
and then for the second half of the year

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,100
Vinay actually took me on as his

109
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:32,740
technician and that involved you know

110
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,900
some taste testing of the wines that we

111
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,199
in the places we were working make sure

112
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,060
that everything's ok and I was also

113
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,339
working for the university's research

114
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,439
vineyard as a technician I was doing

115
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,289
lots of practical things like driving

116
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,779
the tractor spraying slashing mowing

117
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,129
repairing irrigation getting those

118
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,189
practical skills under my belt

119
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,939
it was a great awesome experience very

120
00:04:54,189 --> 00:05:00,490
thankful for that and in between it all

121
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:03,670
I traveled and I saw lots of animals I

122
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,970
travelled some more and I'm really happy

123
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:09,009
with all the animals I met this year and

124
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,630
my schedule was flexible enough that it

125
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,759
allowed me to do that which was really

126
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:18,069
great so the million dollar question is

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,349
how many projects does Benet have

128
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:24,849
because any of you who know him know

129
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,950
that he is like just just unstoppable so

130
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,020
passionate about his work and he takes

131
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:30,550
on everything he never says no so I

132
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,199
can't tell you how many projects he has

133
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,850
even though that was kind of my job was

134
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,099
to know how many projects he has because

135
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,629
almost every week she'd be talking to me

136
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,430
about some other projects that I didn't

137
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,659
know he had and I was like I thought I'm

138
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,819
here technician I thought I'm supposed

139
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,470
to do these things but there are just

140
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:47,949
too many I can't even count but to give

141
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,600
you a little bit of a sample this is one

142
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,779
of his new PhD students and she's

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,970
working on volatile signal signaling for

144
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,289
drought stress in grapevines so it's

145
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,640
starting off as a green house study

146
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,610
that's super interesting then we had I

147
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,490
wrote about this in my blog post once

148
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,759
this is continuous sensing of grapevine

149
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,250
water status using infrared cameras and

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,930
that was down in Kenora so he's trying

151
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,529
to develop an index that will correlate

152
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,420
these thermal missed thermal data to

153
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:23,139
bind water status so I spent a lot of

154
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,900
time helping on that project that

155
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,699
project also involves flying airplanes

156
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,169
with multispectral cameras over the

157
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,079
vineyards which was super cool and we

158
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,848
got to see this airplane

159
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,068
this year in awara he has a new

160
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:39,589
project on berry cell death and how that

161
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,960
relates to berry shrivel which is a

162
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:44,899
concern for them down there so this is a

163
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,818
fluorescent microscopy image that I made

164
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,348
of a berry that I sliced and stay and

165
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,810
then we run that through computer

166
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:53,688
programs to see how much cell death is

167
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:57,168
occurring so that's ongoing this coming

168
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:59,028
year he's still got his micro

169
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,769
tensiometer project happening which some

170
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,949
of you may be familiar with which is

171
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:06,079
that chip that sits in the vine xylem

172
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:11,319
and monitors water status continuously

173
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:14,060
as well as he's also working on

174
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:18,520
hyperspectral imagery or laser

175
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,759
hyperspectral sensing of viruses so

176
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,500
right now we have this backpack

177
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,210
contraption but hopefully he wants to

178
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,069
put this on a drone with the camera and

179
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:31,218
just get hyper spectral images of

180
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:34,400
vineyards to detect viruses so that's

181
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:36,348
just a small sample of Vinay's ongoing

182
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,978
work that i got to participate in which

183
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:41,538
was great and now i am going to talk to

184
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:44,449
you about a project that i worked

185
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:45,889
intensively on active canopy cooling

186
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,038
strategies to mitigate the negative

187
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:51,800
effects of heat waves on grapevines and

188
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,438
I gave this presentation a few weeks ago

189
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,968
at the crush seminar at the University

190
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:04,218
of Adelaide and so yeah hopefully it

191
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:05,718
goes nice and smooth this time so back

192
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:08,538
to climate change the reason I went to

193
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,338
Australia all over the world obviously

194
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,019
agriculture is going to have to contend

195
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,550
with the effects of climate change in

196
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:15,468
Australia where most wine growing

197
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,528
regions are semi-arid and Mediterranean

198
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:20,959
climates we have to worry about the

199
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:24,019
seasons getting hotter and drier so

200
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,388
we're worried about a few things not

201
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:29,149
limited to compressed growing seasons

202
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,978
which means hotter shorter seasons a

203
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,620
dual warming effect and most models are

204
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:35,479
predicting that damage to reproductive

205
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,278
organ development which is the flowers

206
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,120
which send results in our fruit the most

207
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,059
important thing

208
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,698
failure of flamer flavor and aroma

209
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,189
development so a lot of heat can squash

210
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:48,069
out those compounds that we

211
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,360
for in quality wine and overall water

212
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,430
scarcity across the board so not just in

213
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,990
the culture but all agricultural

214
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:59,439
pursuits are gonna be dealing with water

215
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,470
scarcity so what can we do because in

216
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,630
the coming decades I want to be like a

217
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,279
world-famous viticulturist so I have to

218
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,100
deal with this right so we have to do

219
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,259
something and even if we stop emitting

220
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,909
carbon today right now even if we shut

221
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,679
off all our cars and stop eating beef

222
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:16,209
we're still going to be dealing with the

223
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,679
effects of climate change in the years

224
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,019
to come because the climate has inertia

225
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:24,669
so at this point the best risk

226
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,649
management strategy is adaptation so

227
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:29,429
here's a graph that I put together of

228
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,159
the historical occurrence of heat waves

229
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:34,149
up in the Riverland which was that

230
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,829
northeastern yellow area that I

231
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,189
discussed really really hot high

232
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:42,879
intensity agriculture high yields and

233
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,590
last year 1617 we only had four heat

234
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,689
waves so that's relatively fewer than in

235
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:50,830
previous years but we only expect that

236
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:53,080
trend to increase as the years go by so

237
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,540
how do we define a heat wave for our

238
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,139
study for this purpose we define a heat

239
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:02,529
wave as three days or more of 35 degrees

240
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:06,610
Celsius or greater and we arrived at

241
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:09,370
that definition using the Greer and

242
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,259
Whedon paper where they showed that at

243
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,230
that threshold we're seeing negative

244
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:18,039
effects on vine physiology and wine

245
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,039
quality great ventolin qualities as far

246
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,750
as active canopy cooling goes the whole

247
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,969
point of this presentation there's not

248
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,909
too much in the field on active canopy

249
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,580
cooling in the 70s in California Algebra

250
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,379
II and Gilbert looked at overhead

251
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,660
sprinkling and they did have some

252
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:38,379
success with that but it hasn't really

253
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:40,389
been touched since more recently last

254
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:43,149
year curuvija at the University of

255
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,429
Adelaide investigated in canopy cooling

256
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,019
so misting in the canopy and we actually

257
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,609
have an extension of that project

258
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,829
happening this year that I worked on as

259
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,600
well I'm not going to go into that one

260
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,129
in depth for this presentation but I'm

261
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,149
happy to talk about it with any of you

262
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,149
if you're curious later

263
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,169
so our objectives for this work were to

264
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,990
evaluate the vine performance during the

265
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,879
heat waves we looked at the canopy

266
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,740
microclimate so the temperature the

267
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
humidity the vapor pressure deficit and

268
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,840
we looked at the effects on grape and

269
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,490
wine quality so we were up in the

270
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,700
Riverland as I said we were working with

271
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,399
a commercial grower on Savion Blanc

272
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,090
vines for court on sprawl absolutely

273
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,579
huge vines very high yielding and we had

274
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,649
these two trials at the same site right

275
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,600
next to each other the in canopy cooling

276
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,120
trial which was a misting in the canopy

277
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,100
trial that I just mentioned but I'll

278
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,310
talk about later if you want and then

279
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,590
the under canopy cooling trial which is

280
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,689
a special interest to me and that's what

281
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,930
we'll talk about today so the under

282
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,030
canopy cooling trial or UCC had two

283
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:54,819
treatments compared to control the

284
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:57,789
control was your traditional drip line

285
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,070
irrigation grower controlled just your

286
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:02,169
regular drip line the under canopy

287
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,510
sprinklers the first treatment or UCS

288
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,610
were basically broadcast sprinklers that

289
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,950
wet the entire mid row of the vineyard

290
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,289
floor so under the vine in the middle of

291
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,839
the vine everywhere was wet and then the

292
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:16,599
supplemental irrigation or si was a

293
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,089
bypass drip line that deposited the same

294
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,430
volume of water but directly under the

295
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,530
vine instead of everywhere like the UCS

296
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:27,399
did it put the same amount of water just

297
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:28,838
under the vine oh sorry and the most

298
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,490
important thing about these treatments

299
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,860
is to keep in mind that they were on at

300
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,810
night so if we saw a heat wave was

301
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,669
coming up we would trigger the system to

302
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,229
go on the night before and all of the

303
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:43,240
nights during the heat wave but this

304
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:46,360
wasn't happening during the day so we

305
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,440
collected a lot of data because Vinay

306
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,419
loves data and I am going to primarily

307
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,850
talk to you about the data we collected

308
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:56,860
on the caffeine microclimate the leaves

309
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,040
gas exchange and the soil and plant

310
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:04,029
water statuses but don't worry we also

311
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,620
looked at a lot of other things so that

312
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,110
would take me a long time to go through

313
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,269
but

314
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,490
we have and this is a picture of our NGO

315
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,120
or infrared gas analyzer it's made by

316
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,159
likeor and this machine is was initially

317
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,778
very scary to me but now I'm intimately

318
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,969
acquainted with it and I use it a lot

319
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:24,980
this year and that helps us understand

320
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,600
the photosynthesis and the stomata

321
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:32,778
conductance and leaves so here are some

322
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,389
graphs I put together of the temperature

323
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,100
and the vapor pressure deficit at the

324
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,019
hottest part of the day during a

325
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,959
heatwave so this was three or more days

326
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,659
at 35 C or greater this particular day

327
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:48,139
was over 40 Celsius and this is the heat

328
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:50,389
of the day and the dot-dash line on the

329
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:53,000
bottom of both graphs is the under

330
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:55,129
canopy sprinkler or the UCS so you can

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,589
see that the temperature of the UCS

332
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:00,588
treatment stayed below 40 degrees even

333
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:03,019
at the hottest part of the day and the

334
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,720
vapor pressure deficit was below 5 kilo

335
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,039
Pascal's and remember that these

336
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,540
treatments were on at night so we're

337
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,519
seeing this effect in the middle of the

338
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:14,419
day which is pretty awesome in my

339
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,360
opinion and here you see basically more

340
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,578
ideal physiological conditions for

341
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,528
physiological function during this heat

342
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:23,299
wave in the ucs treatment while the SI

343
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:28,159
and the control are much hotter and

344
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:30,109
drier here are a couple of thermal

345
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,909
images we put together so you can kind

346
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,579
of visualize what's happening in the mid

347
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,708
row and under vine in the control you

348
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:39,379
had a really hot in the drove 45 degrees

349
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:42,319
Celsius in the supplemental irrigation

350
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,929
it was cooler at 38 but it was coolest

351
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,079
in the under canopy sprinklers at 33 and

352
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:55,789
the same trend is happening under the

353
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:59,179
vine as well so now we will go into the

354
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:01,639
soil and plant water status so top graph

355
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:04,099
is pre-dawn water potential of my

356
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,230
favorite measurement 3 o'clock in the

357
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,690
morning we go out and we do pressure

358
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,350
bombing which is take a leaf put it in a

359
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,880
chamber put pressure on it and see how

360
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,459
much pressure it takes to make a drop of

361
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,259
water come out and in the pre-dawn that

362
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,528
gives us an idea of soil moisture

363
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,509
content so

364
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:23,129
creet on water potential correlates with

365
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,259
soil moistures that's why we take that

366
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:28,050
measurement then the bottom graph is

367
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,389
midday stem water potential which gives

368
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:34,258
us an idea of the plants water status so

369
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:36,808
soil water status plant water status and

370
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,879
you can see again mid heatwave in the

371
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:40,919
middle of a heat wave the control is the

372
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,659
black the supplemental irrigation is the

373
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,198
chequered and the under canopy

374
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:48,448
sprinklers is the gray and there are no

375
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,748
significant differences in soil water

376
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:54,149
status across any of these treatments so

377
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:56,308
we know based on that that we are not

378
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,620
having an irrigation effect with these

379
00:15:56,308 --> 00:16:00,389
treatments the point of this research is

380
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,549
not to irrigate the vines it's to

381
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,079
actively cool them so how can we apply

382
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:06,599
water so that it has a cooling effect

383
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,359
it's not intended to irrigate the vines

384
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,579
so based on that lack of significance in

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,100
the top graph lack of difference in soil

386
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:17,609
moisture we see no irrigation effect if

387
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,069
you will then we look down at the midday

388
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,579
water potential and we see that the

389
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:25,620
control is significantly lower than the

390
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:27,568
two treatments so the control is

391
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,149
relatively water stress during this

392
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:32,458
heatwave compared to the two treatments

393
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,769
but there are no differences between the

394
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:38,179
SI and the UCS so keep that in mind

395
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:42,089
while we move to this slide

396
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:45,778
so again middle of a heat wave top graph

397
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:49,230
a n net photosynthesis bottom graph G

398
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:51,778
ESTs the model conductance and you can

399
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,389
see that the control in both the

400
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,899
photosynthesis and the conductance has

401
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,430
significantly lower rates for both

402
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,318
that's easily explained by the fact that

403
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,120
the plant is water stress as we saw in

404
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,438
the previous slide looking at the midday

405
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,409
stem water potential

406
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,449
but then curiously we see a difference

407
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:12,419
between the two treatments for both

408
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,579
parameters so we can't explain the

409
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,829
difference in photosynthesis for the two

410
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,019
treatments based on water status because

411
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,480
we saw here that there was no difference

412
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:23,220
in water status for the treatments so we

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,199
have to explain this somehow out some

414
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,600
other way we have two theories that we

415
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,490
will or not we they will investigate

416
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,369
further this year unfortunately I can't

417
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,160
be there

418
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:39,409
the first being that perhaps because in

419
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,570
the supplemental irrigation the root

420
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,630
zone is very wet it's concentrated

421
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:47,419
directly under the vine a wet area that

422
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,000
abscisic acid or ABA is being

423
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,250
translocated up from the root zone to

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,170
the leaves and closing the stomata down

425
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,759
regulating photosynthesis and stomatal

426
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,529
conductance and that might not be

427
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,269
happening in the ucs because the water

428
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,190
is distributed all across the vineyard

429
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:03,950
floor

430
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:06,830
another possibility is simply that the

431
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,590
canopy microclimate in the ucs is more

432
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:11,750
favorable for photosynthesis and

433
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,369
stomatal conductance in the middle of a

434
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,369
heat wave because we saw that it's a lot

435
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:19,909
cooler and less dry lower vapor pressure

436
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:22,219
deficit during the heat wave so that

437
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,759
soil evaporation can just be promoting

438
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:30,920
overall more ideal conditions for canopy

439
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:33,859
function during a heatwave so as far as

440
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,230
other results go we saw significantly

441
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:41,899
higher TA or titratable acidity in the

442
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,490
ucs and si treatment lines so that's

443
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,259
great because we want to preserve

444
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,370
acidity through these heat events loss

445
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:53,240
of acidity in must or grapes after heat

446
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:55,729
events is something we don't want we

447
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,099
didn't see any differences in yield but

448
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,900
we can conclude that the ucs treatment

449
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,529
is effectively cooling the canopy and

450
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,519
promoting ideal conditions for

451
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:10,069
physiological function during heat waves

452
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:12,440
if you ask me why I don't think we saw

453
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:15,259
many more results than this this year I

454
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,970
think it's because it wasn't such a hot

455
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,920
year for Australia as you saw in the

456
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,049
first graph there were four heat waves

457
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,320
which is not so much for for this

458
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:26,750
climate and I think that in future years

459
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,149
when it's hotter and drier and you have

460
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,359
more heat events you might see these

461
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,840
treatments start to separate in other

462
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:37,789
parameters so yeah that's that's my

463
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,480
theory as to why there wasn't so many

464
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:44,349
differences this year in this coming

465
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,400
season we're going to they're going to

466
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,059
characterize the route density and

467
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,950
distribution

468
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,299
and evaluate the soil moisture and

469
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,830
temperature since we didn't do that last

470
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,440
year we really don't know what's going

471
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,779
on underground are there roots in the

472
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,420
mid row are they active what is the soil

473
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,910
temperature and moisture in those areas

474
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,560
that can really help us hone in on our

475
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,110
theories as to why we saw those

476
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,389
physiological differences and they're

477
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:11,449
also going to sample abscisic acid or

478
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,580
ABA at time points before during and

479
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,590
after he wave so we can see if there's

480
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:20,659
any differences in that hormone so for

481
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:22,639
this project I'd like to thank wine

482
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,320
australia for their funding Oxford

483
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,200
landing estates was our cooperating

484
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,329
grower they did a great job and lots of

485
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,360
people in our lab and outside of our lab

486
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:36,829
who helped on this they were awesome and

487
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,959
they really saved Boston and for this

488
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:41,119
entire experience overall I'd like to

489
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,390
thank the drear committee Nina

490
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,489
Marvin John and I have to thank Fran

491
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,460
Bonet and the whole lab for just making

492
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,339
this year beyond incredible I learned so

493
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,079
much I am so grateful and I can't say

494
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:57,709
enough good things about the drear award

495
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:00,829
or about Vinay in his lab because it's

496
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:35,620
they're just amazing so yeah I'd like to

497
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:35,619
thank everybody so we were just

498
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:47,240
yeah sure yeah so I think the question

499
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:50,990
is about disease pressure with a wet

500
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,970
canopy is that right and you use nets to

501
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,289
cool so shade cloth is absolutely one

502
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,289
option to cool your canopy

503
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,899
there's work on that as we know in

504
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,178
Australia in this very dry climate we

505
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,769
didn't

506
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:06,659
see any increase in disease pressure

507
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:08,940
yeah there was really like it was

508
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,190
negligible I think in the Finger Lakes

509
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,769
it wouldn't be possible to do in canopy

510
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,528
misting that would just yet be a

511
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:19,499
disaster probably here

512
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:21,808
but in this hot dry climate it's really

513
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:23,730
not even a concern that's the first

514
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:25,740
thing I thought when I got there because

515
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm I was cool climate conditioned when

516
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,659
I got over there but we didn't see any

517
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,839
disease incidents increase with that and

518
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:47,580
can't be misting project yeah does that

519
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:50,788
answer it each night oh sorry yeah yeah

520
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:54,710
so Connor asked me about how much water

521
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:57,749
was applied at night for those

522
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,429
treatments and I'm just gonna pull up

523
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:00,950
that information because I don't want to

524
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:04,309
give you the wrong answer but I have it

525
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:08,569
so it is it's a lot of water obviously

526
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:11,190
but you know our our point is to

527
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:12,980
preserve or increase the quality

528
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,110
maintain the quality or make it better

529
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,480
going into these really hot seasons that

530
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:21,118
were expecting uh

531
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,288
so you have to use more water right so

532
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:24,178
what's the best way to use it

533
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:26,158
should we just irrigate or should we try

534
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:30,860
something like this like active canopy

535
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,860
cooling that's that's a valid question

536
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:36,089
no sorry yeah I'm trying to find this

537
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,638
for you

538
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:50,638
i calibrated the system before I left

539
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:53,368
but I forgot so basically the so the

540
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:55,859
sprinklers turned on for 30 minutes

541
00:23:53,368 --> 00:24:00,089
every hour and a half for a total of

542
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:05,278
four cycles throughout the night and the

543
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:11,309
flow rate was 57 litres per vine per

544
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:18,660
night and then yeah

545
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:22,529
for the for the whole year in the under

546
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,290
canopy sprinkler treatment the water

547
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:28,680
application for the season was five

548
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,779
point six mega litres per hectare if you

549
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,420
compare that to the grower irrigation

550
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:37,649
the grower irrigation is seven point

551
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:57,029
seven mega litres per hectare so does

552
00:24:37,650 --> 00:25:00,840
that give you some context kind of so

553
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:02,759
for this under canopy cooling trial so

554
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,919
this is not the in canopy misting trial

555
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,470
that I like briefly mentioned but for

556
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,470
this under canopy trial you can see that

557
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:15,600
the temperature was maintained

558
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:17,250
throughout the day for the in canopy

559
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,069
misting which I did not present the data

560
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:22,200
on the temperature drops very quickly

561
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:24,720
five to eight degrees Celsius in the

562
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,720
canopy but then it came back up almost

563
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,329
immediately and so this year they're

564
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,880
gonna tweak that and try to their

565
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:35,609
modeling it and trying to see like what

566
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,830
is the optimal frequency and duration of

567
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:41,219
misting to maintain the canopy

568
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:55,109
temperature at or below 35 C that's the

569
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:57,029
goal ideally so if you find because of

570
00:25:55,109 --> 00:26:03,439
the chemical response just you

571
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:03,440
mentioning but he get really hot but

572
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:12,240
something to consider negative effect I

573
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,640
don't think so because when we have

574
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,620
these really intense heat events the

575
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,440
vines are often shutting down right so

576
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,059
they're stopping physiological function

577
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,240
and then you might be losing some of

578
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,940
your desirable components and the grapes

579
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,819
aroma compounds and whatnot actually

580
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,529
when we harvested this trial the

581
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,480
cooperating grower was supposed to

582
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:36,629
harvest just about the same time as us

583
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,549
but they held off almost a week and a

584
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,940
half to two weeks after because we

585
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,500
harvested right after a heatwave and

586
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,750
they wanted to wait for the vines to

587
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,769
build up more sugar because they had

588
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,420
kind of just shut down at that point so

589
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,670
we're worried about like hotter shorter

590
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,680
seasons and faster ripening we're also

591
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,910
worried about vines just quitting when

592
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,640
it's too hot right

593
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,230
and then loss of those desirable

594
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:12,150
characteristics and your grapes and wine

595
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:20,910
during those really high heat events do

596
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:26,940
you have any questions yeah okay ah hi

597
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:29,700
Raquel this Tim Martinson yeah can you

598
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,769
comment on you know given the water

599
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,140
shortage and the droughts that they have

600
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:37,319
what are what is the industry in general

601
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,500
is doing to address the water shortage

602
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:43,379
are they using different methods of

603
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,509
scheduling irrigation or what what

604
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,710
what's the response been to the drought

605
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:51,930
in general it's really Oh first of all

606
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,700
first of all last year was actually not

607
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:57,360
a drought at all it was a very wet year

608
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,460
Australia so while I was there that's

609
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,259
not a good example because they had more

610
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,230
rain in their growing seasons than we

611
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:11,910
had in our 2016 growing season which is

612
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:14,970
pretty incredible but I I was pretty

613
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:21,330
amazed to tell you the truth about the

614
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:23,870
lack of a consistent response to these

615
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:26,250
drought events or irrigation in general

616
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,159
you know a lot of our cooperating

617
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,289
growers we're asking vinay like what

618
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,750
what do we do like how do we how do we

619
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:35,609
schedule like when do we irrigate you

620
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,160
know we go by like touching the leaves

621
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:38,559
or

622
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,380
visual clues or something right and so

623
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,589
it was really amazing to see that there

624
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,800
is like a lack of knowledge that will

625
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:49,599
allow them to respond to this and so

626
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,509
that's exactly like what he's working on

627
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:56,230
right so it was okay it was great to see

628
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:59,799
that our work is very needed there and

629
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,140
it was really a grower by grower like

630
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,460
everyone had their own response really

631
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,140
turn on their irrigation

632
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,180
I don't know they'll be okay oh the

633
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,500
leaves look a little hot and tilted away

634
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,170
from the Sun maybe we should turn it on

635
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,960
now so it was really not consistent and

636
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,410
you an Australian viticulture and wine

637
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,210
making overall I think is very

638
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,330
technology savvy and they're really on

639
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:25,779
the cutting edge I think but the fact

640
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:28,389
that they didn't have a consistent

641
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:30,369
response was just yeah Wow

642
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:44,950
like we need this work right really

643
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:46,029
needs to be done not personally but I

644
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,100
think some people use it

645
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:50,440
none of the sites that I visited we're

646
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:53,980
doing anything like that but yeah

647
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,220
there's our di but in terms of people

648
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,920
are really at a loss that's like what

649
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,650
the best route going forward is for

650
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:07,090
irrigation scheduling and dealing with

651
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:08,680
these heat events yeah that's that's my

652
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:11,470
honest perception you know someone

653
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,810
someone could tell me otherwise but I I

654
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:20,319
heard it for more than one grower and I

655
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:22,569
was amazed yeah yeah um so I'm not

656
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,779
making this argument but how would you

657
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:27,700
respond to to this argument that look

658
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:31,389
climate is getting hotter we're running

659
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,970
out of good water is this really a good

660
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,910
use of our scarce resources and at one

661
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,819
point should we kind of pull the plug on

662
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:43,750
trying to grow grapes in Australia

663
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:46,089
anyways and how can we do this more

664
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,630
sustainably longer like what's the logic

665
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:51,230
there

666
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:53,270
yeah it's a valid question I mean I'm

667
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:57,470
not prepared personally to give up my

668
00:30:53,269 --> 00:31:00,819
Australian wine because I think there is

669
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:03,019
recourse right but I don't know I think

670
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:05,779
agriculture in Australia needs to

671
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,240
undergo some changes as a whole like

672
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:10,038
they're still growing rice in this same

673
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,650
region of Australia like that is

674
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:13,849
ridiculous right having rice paddies in

675
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,980
the outback

676
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:22,298
essentially so not to be like species

677
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,298
but I would prioritize

678
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:29,720
grape quality over growing rice in the

679
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:32,270
almost Australian outback and the whole

680
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,150
point of this is to see you know how can

681
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,558
we do it as efficiently as possible

682
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,900
we're going to need more water but how

683
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,700
should we apply it right and what will

684
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,610
make the biggest difference for our

685
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:48,919
quality with using the less well the

686
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:50,899
least water possible is that exactly

687
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,450
thank you there's I don't think there's

688
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,450
like a one right answer for that right

689
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,588
[Music]

690
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:27,798
so do I do we irrigate the roots to

691
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:30,408
decrease temperature correct so we so

692
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:32,599
okay so the question I think was we are

693
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:34,880
applying water under the canopy to

694
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:44,058
decrease the temperature of the canopy

695
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:47,110
of the vines so okay so there were two

696
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:50,450
like I said before there were two

697
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:52,399
experiments there was the in canopy

698
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,009
cooling experiment which is misters

699
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,140
inside the canopy and then there was

700
00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:00,200
this under canopy cooling experiment

701
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,920
which was misting on the vineyard floor

702
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,370
right

703
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,590
so it's two separate experiments and

704
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:08,869
this one under canopy cooling was

705
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:12,349
applying water broadcast to the vineyard

706
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:16,909
floor and this one in canopy cooling had

707
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:25,789
misters inside the canopy does that make

708
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:47,060
sense yeah it was like it was a sprayer

709
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:48,349
system in the canopy so Ann wants to

710
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,450
know if we're looking at the route

711
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:53,869
turnover rate in the under canopy

712
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,910
sprinkler treatment so we actually

713
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:58,819
haven't looked at anything below ground

714
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,800
yet so this coming year is gonna be all

715
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:03,259
about what's yeah what's going on

716
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,299
underground because we know almost

717
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:08,500
nothing about that and that could be the

718
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:17,599
key to explaining a lot of this same

719
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:21,260
I'll let you know and they tell me I

720
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,690
don't know about the analysis method but

721
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,110
basically when we are sorry Geneva she

722
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:30,010
asked me what method of Abyei analysis

723
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:33,050
were using so I'm not sure about the

724
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,820
chemical analysis of it but how we

725
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,440
collected or we will collect it is is

726
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,690
when we do the pressure bomb so we do

727
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,329
that midday stem water potential and you

728
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:47,059
have the leaf in the chamber and the

729
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,940
water droplet comes out of the stem

730
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,509
we're gonna pipette that into a little

731
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,079
vial

732
00:34:50,510 --> 00:35:04,960
you only need I think a tiny amount yeah

733
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:04,960
yeah exactly yeah anyone else you want

734
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:16,889
this has been a production of Cornell
