1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,089
so Gus thank you and I'd like to thank

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,580
the folks in plant biology at Cornell

5
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,109
University for allowing me to do this

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,589
seminar tell you something that's been a

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,019
passion in my life for the last 35 36

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,730
years and also to come back to Cornell

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,460
which is one of my most favorite places

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,769
in the world to be my time as a postdoc

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,600
here was really really wonderful so

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,949
every decade or so I come back and it's

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,500
really quite nice but what I'd like to

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,859
do today is start you off sort of with a

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,390
very big global perspective if you were

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,670
on a spaceship and you were coming to

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,109
the planet Earth the color that you

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,749
would see on the planet would be blue

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,338
primarily from all the aquatic

20
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,260
environments on the planet but let's get

21
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,088
rid of them and if we were to look at

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,009
the land masses the other color that

23
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:55,049
would be pretty obvious is that of green

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,549
and that of course comes from the

25
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,858
pigments that you get from the great

26
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,908
diversity of land plants that occupy

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:07,079
many many many terrestrial ecosystems on

28
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:09,209
the planet so the big question as in

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,599
intriguing plant biologists for a long

30
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,759
time has been where did land plants come

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,359
from from what group of organisms did

32
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,140
they come from

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,379
so if you went back about 450 million

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,968
years 500 million years this is what

35
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:27,209
eukaryotic plant life might look like it

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,538
would be green algae living probably in

37
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,129
a thermal outflow of a shallow wetland

38
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,989
area kind of like what you would see if

39
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,670
you went to Yellowstone National Park

40
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,289
and moved away from the real areal hot

41
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,859
springs

42
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:43,950
so about 450 million years ago we went

43
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:46,559
from this up to this over here

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,170
and the group of organisms that we've

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,850
come to know as the ancestors of land

46
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,379
plants and those most closely related to

47
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,408
land plants are called the Kyra fights

48
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,089
or the more proper taxonomic designation

49
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,679
would be the strep the fights the basal

50
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,530
strep device and you undoubtedly have

51
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:03,868
seen them if you've gone to any aquatic

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,520
ecosystem freshwater algae for the most

53
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:09,929
part but a unique group of of algae not

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,659
the biggest group within the green algae

55
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,340
so what I wanted to do just spend a

56
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,590
minute and talk a little bit about the

57
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,830
history of the discovery of Kara fights

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,280
as being land plant ancestors and it

59
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,740
really

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,189
hasn't been all that long ago that there

61
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,930
are other ideas as to where land plants

62
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,900
and the whole idea of multicellularity

63
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,510
came from if you got to a point let's

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,219
say before the 1960s you would see many

65
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,870
different phylogenetic schemes and one

66
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,669
of the more common ones is it gets

67
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,069
something like climate a mones as a

68
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,958
basal organism and then you would have

69
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:44,969
colonial green algae that swim that

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,250
don't swim then you get to filamentous

71
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,109
organisms and then branch filaments and

72
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,379
then Frank amidst issue and then there

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,819
you go

74
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,150
and the story there's the land plants

75
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,889
okay so at that time please remember

76
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,909
that the technology that was available

77
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,199
for people to come up to interpret what

78
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,669
might be happening out there was

79
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,659
somewhat limited based on reproductive

80
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:09,268
biology some basic microscopy and really

81
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,509
that was about it well something

82
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,610
happened in the 1960s that really

83
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,469
changed the whole equation just like

84
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,660
many of the new techniques and protocols

85
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:22,289
and instruments that we have a molecular

86
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:24,299
biology today in the 1960s and Beyond it

87
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,328
was the electron microscope that changed

88
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,030
things and in the 1960s people started

89
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,790
using glutaraldehyde as primary fixative

90
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,310
or preparing things for TEM and you got

91
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,929
superior fixation so I just want to

92
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,989
introduce you to some of the great

93
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,090
characters in the history of camera

94
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,079
fights so I've called this the modern

95
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,909
era from about the 1960s until today one

96
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,159
of the Keith pioneers was an Australian

97
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,739
scientist by the name of Jeremy Pickett

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,750
heaps and Jeremy Pickett heaps was at

99
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,469
the University of Colorado for a long

100
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,769
period of time and he was a meticulous

101
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:04,049
microspace a great guy and Jeremy was a

102
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,209
good light microscopy this he would take

103
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,159
his different green algae and he would

104
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,739
spend hours just positioning him just

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,319
right on the light microscope to see for

106
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,410
example cell division events to take a

107
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,969
look at reproductive cells um a variety

108
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,820
of different things but he was also an

109
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,289
outstanding electron microscopy he was

110
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:28,740
able to pinpoint specific processes

111
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:30,750
using thin section TEM and if you were

112
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,139
to go down probably to man library you'd

113
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,899
probably find this book from 1975 which

114
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,900
he was an amazing book it had a lot of

115
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,839
his micrographs and he was able from

116
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,478
about 1972 to 1975 in a series of

117
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,239
publications to define this group of

118
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,560
algae known as the ko fights there were

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,418
different names at the time but he was

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,848
one of the first people to champion the

121
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,269
idea of ko fights as land plant

122
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:59,639
ancestors using ultra structural work

123
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,649
then we had other workers we had Carl

124
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,569
Maddox and Ken Stewart from Miami

125
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,459
University those are my major professors

126
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,250
who about a decade later came up with a

127
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,989
really nice paper in 1984 giving more

128
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,750
definition to the Cairo fights and then

129
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,269
Linda Graham ma2 University of Wisconsin

130
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,930
who worked on a very famous ko fight

131
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:20,908
Colio kitty and was looking at the

132
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,978
pattern formation in the formation of

133
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:25,438
parenchymal tissue or the crank

134
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:28,769
Mississippi white material there and

135
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,249
since the 1980s we've also had a large

136
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,408
group of molecular pioneers that have

137
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,778
come in and interestingly enough a lot

138
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:39,120
of the molecular data that has been used

139
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:41,430
to look at the Kara bites really kind of

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,110
confirms what people like ticket heaps

141
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,500
and others were able to come up with

142
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,629
with the electron microscope so very

143
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,848
interesting history and it was in the

144
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,860
70s and 80s really where a lot of this

145
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:56,069
started to blossom alright so here's the

146
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,169
green algae so in this big room known as

147
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,000
the green algae most of the green algae

148
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,829
are not Kara fights they belong to a

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,408
group that will call the chlorophyta and

150
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,478
within the chlorophyll you have things

151
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:08,519
like your seaweeds the former all the

152
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,860
heights there now in this group you have

153
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,528
some freshwater filamentous forms you

154
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,778
have the lichen algae climate omona

155
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,399
spits in this particular group but

156
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:20,158
probably the largest and most diverse

157
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,439
group that you have are these things

158
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:25,139
they are designated in the presenta

159
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,968
fight and these are as Carl Maddox my

160
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,620
major professor once said little round

161
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:30,750
green things that swim or don't swim and

162
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,389
you really got to believe that because

163
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,759
these are really tiny organism Pico

164
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,460
plankton found in the oceans some of the

165
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,710
cells may be only a micron or two in

166
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,930
size they're the most abundant

167
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:46,259
eukaryotes on the planet they would fit

168
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,600
into this group but then we come to

169
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,819
Strep the fights or the Kara fights and

170
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,550
it really is a group of strange

171
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:57,449
bedfellows that you find in this

172
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,449
particular group the morphology is very

173
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,069
very different okay you'll see in just a

174
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:06,389
second that the different forms that you

175
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:08,009
find there are quite unique so let's

176
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,879
take a look at the Cairo fights really

177
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,500
quickly and if we were to look at the ex

178
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,360
thought Kara fights that are out there

179
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,579
there's basically two groups

180
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,129
there's the early divergent taxa and

181
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,899
within this group we have an organism

182
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,279
name is the stigma it's little round

183
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,549
green thing that looks like the

184
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,279
flattened lifeboat swims around and for

185
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,710
all of you who are interested in other

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,189
parts of biology this organism produces

187
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:36,930
beautiful layers of scales and this was

188
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:40,379
one of the organism along with some of

189
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,180
its cousins that kindly start to put an

190
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,879
end to how a Golgi apparatus how the

191
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,370
Golgi body works where in effect you do

192
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,949
have the sister neova Golgi actually

193
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,810
move through from the sista trans face

194
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,599
you can see the scales actually forming

195
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,339
as opposed to just stationary sister nee

196
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,129
and you have vesicles taking things from

197
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,789
sister Ana to cisterna chloric ibis and

198
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:05,159
a new law and rarely found terrestrial

199
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,930
organism if anybody would like to talk

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,400
about this later I'd love to talk about

201
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,480
Clark ibis especially if you're

202
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,179
interested in the evolution of

203
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,730
hydrolyzable tannins unique organism

204
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,459
clubs or medium an organism whose genome

205
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,620
is the first of the kara fights to be

206
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,409
sequenced this is an organism that you

207
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,209
find in many terrestrial and semi

208
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,130
aquatic areas if you walk through the

209
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,839
desert Southwest and you're walking at

210
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:29,339
certain times of the year you're in the

211
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,779
desert you're not walking on sand

212
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,209
they're sander but you hear crunch

213
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,209
crunch crunch those are films of clubs

214
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,190
or midium but most people who are

215
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,379
interested in the evolution of land

216
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,810
plants or looking at the lake divergent

217
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:45,299
taxa so we have things like Keira and

218
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,699
night Ella that you may have seen Colio

219
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,889
kitty many species formed as purring

220
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,300
them dislike tissue like hey kind of

221
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,139
looks like the liver work so this would

222
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,729
be a good candidate has been a popular

223
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,129
and it for what's the closest living

224
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,909
ancestors to land plants and then we

225
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,320
have the

226
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:04,500
educating green algae things like

227
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,960
Desmond's and filamentous forms

228
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,080
spirogyra Moogie osha you probably have

229
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,030
seen them alright so here we go here are

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,430
the Cairo fights and here are the

231
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,470
different groups and up until about five

232
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,649
or ten years ago there was a question

233
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,690
which of the late divergent forms was

234
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,720
the most closely related to land plants

235
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,220
okay so I come from Saratoga Springs New

236
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,660
York and we just finished the racing

237
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,990
season so it was kind of like a horse

238
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:33,659
race at the time and that is well maybe

239
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,200
it's going to be something like Kara

240
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,879
okay because yeah it's macroscopic looks

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,100
like it has higher plant tissue has

242
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,899
these worlds but it's basically an

243
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,000
aggregation of filaments but its

244
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,029
reproductive structures look like a the

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,750
land plant so maybe then there's the

246
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,360
co-opt

247
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,009
okay so the Kaleo detailees well some

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,029
species have perimeters tissue they have

249
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,700
antheridia like male reproductive

250
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,399
structures and ago neom the zygotes

251
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,110
retained on the plant so hey there we go

252
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,659
this has got to be the hands-on favorite

253
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,000
and then there is these freaky zig named

254
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:11,730
italian organisms the ones that

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,789
conjugate you know no modal cells got to

256
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:18,269
worry about sperm cells or excels

257
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:22,379
unicellular some filamentous forms so in

258
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,970
the early part of this decade there was

259
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,330
some molecular work that was being done

260
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,009
and what they found out as they were

261
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,810
looking at who was going to win this

262
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:33,149
horse race it was a zig nematodes

263
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:36,000
alright so it's the conjugating green

264
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:39,689
algae that turn out to be the closest

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,220
living ancestors to land plants and one

266
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,540
of the organisms that i'm going to spend

267
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,440
quite a bit of time on today

268
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:48,829
that's pentium and pentium is a very

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,240
simple organism as you will see and

270
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,590
pentium along with spirogyra are

271
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,629
believed to be organisms that represent

272
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,090
things that are closest to land plants

273
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:02,279
now i truly understand that the survey

274
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,870
the that has been done looking at the

275
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,689
file economics of all this has been

276
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,029
really limited but until they do more of

277
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,760
a survey that's all the NSF needs to

278
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,250
know alright so now let's just take a

279
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,620
look at

280
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:20,269
her fights that have been used as model

281
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,250
organisms now terrified say in my title

282
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,049
the word secret well they haven't been

283
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,169
all that secret we've used camera fights

284
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,179
as model organisms for many different

285
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:31,969
biological applications for example

286
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,649
camera and Nutella are well known for

287
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,420
studies of cytoplasmic streaming you

288
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,649
have people in this audience who have

289
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,169
worked on camera and Nutella and

290
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,539
cytoplasmic streaming it's a wonderful

291
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:43,698
organism for studying gravitropism and

292
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:45,559
state'll it's it's an organism that has

293
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:47,569
been in space regular of whether it's

294
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,629
real space or whether it was simulated

295
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,879
space right you have coeliac ET that has

296
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,070
been used as a model for looking at

297
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,220
pattern development patterns in tissue

298
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,680
development you have organisms like the

299
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,940
Desmond's they have this beautiful form

300
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,649
that have been used in cell

301
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,160
morphogenesis and symmetry getting

302
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:09,889
particular morphic genetic patterns in

303
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,708
cells and recently there's been some

304
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:15,110
great stuff we're looking at cell wall

305
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:17,899
polymers hormone physiology signaling

306
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,970
systems that are indicating a camera

307
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,879
fights might be really nice organisms

308
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,120
for studying some basic facts about

309
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,649
plant biology so for me

310
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,568
I've been working on camera fights for a

311
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,318
long period of time and about 15 years

312
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:35,689
ago I got interested in the tremendous

313
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:38,179
amount of polysaccharides produced by

314
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,279
terra fights that are found in shallow

315
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:43,309
aquatic ecosystems in the Northeast I

316
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,078
spend most of my time from about 5:30

317
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:47,539
every morning till 9 out in the field

318
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,039
collecting various Kara fights and

319
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,990
trying to get some of the

320
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,509
polysaccharides off in characterizing

321
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,370
them and I must admit this was a

322
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,470
wonderful experience for many many years

323
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,480
not only because you're able to go out

324
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,769
to some really beautiful places but I

325
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,879
had one of the best laboratory

326
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:08,299
collaborators one of the best laboratory

327
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,639
managers if you like something that was

328
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:13,189
he was meticulous always kept things

329
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,230
organized and made this laboratory

330
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,810
perfect almost every day and it loops

331
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,909
and it was this guy right over here I be

332
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:23,059
versed unbelievable they you know they

333
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,469
do not leave any stick you know out of

334
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,849
place and all you have to do is feed

335
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,850
them sticks along have juicy bark

336
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,089
they'll work for whatever

337
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,810
all right so I was interested in these

338
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,519
blooms and some of the mass amounts of

339
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,578
polysaccharide that are pushed out by

340
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,039
these organisms when they bloom

341
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:42,208
so with these organisms I am working

342
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,778
with these organisms

343
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:48,299
I found alga sac excuse me a pachyderm

344
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:52,588
Desmet a unicellular one known as penny

345
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:54,750
a Margaret aciem this organism was

346
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:57,290
perfect for a lot of studies looking at

347
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,328
cell walls and secretion as you will see

348
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:04,519
one of the main reasons for this is that

349
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:07,708
it's as a very simple morphology its

350
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,500
elongated cylinder with rounded holes

351
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:12,448
it's a typical Desmet it follows the job

352
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,269
description of a desmond it has two semi

353
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:16,919
cells surrounding the central zone but

354
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,110
there are a lot of other features that

355
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,360
you'll see that make pentium kind of a

356
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,519
wonderful organism first of all it

357
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,169
produces only a primary cell wall you'll

358
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,259
have to worry about secondary cell walls

359
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:31,588
complicating issues plus it produces

360
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,539
these unique extracellular gels live

361
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,850
cells can be labeled with a variety of

362
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,769
probes including monoclonal antibodies

363
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,028
and then you could place the cells back

364
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,828
into culture and you can watch

365
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:43,078
development you can watch expansive

366
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:46,528
dynamics it's easy to grow and to

367
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,938
manipulate it accommodates rapid micro

368
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:50,068
array of screening if you want to apply

369
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:54,409
specific inhibitors and see what happens

370
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:56,789
to secretory events and it has an

371
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:58,948
Olympic membrane network that I'm gonna

372
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,990
finish up on that I'd like to show you

373
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:02,758
it's this is a lean mean secretory

374
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,528
machine and I think it's going to be a

375
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,350
great organism for understanding

376
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,240
secretory dynamics and plants so what

377
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,879
I've been doing over the last ten years

378
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,370
is looking at the cell biology opinion

379
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,278
especially expansion dynamics and

380
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,919
membrane trafficking extracellular

381
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,870
wycombe I've also looked at stress

382
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,328
biology in fact that's what Goss even

383
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,750
and I are been working on is a stress

384
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:29,489
biology project sponsored by NSF so I

385
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,589
just want to give you three different

386
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,329
facets of some of the work that's been

387
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,220
done with pen yawns these gonna go has

388
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:37,049
come like categories that you find on

389
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,519
Jeopardy Alex I'd like number one the

390
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,829
real world the most verified so I

391
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,600
listened to your microbiologist

392
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,990
I want to talk to you a little bit about

393
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,230
the unique cell wall where the expansion

394
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,549
mechanism is an easy thing to see Plus

395
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,889
there's something I would call a sticky

396
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:56,629
business and then the third area is

397
00:15:52,889 --> 00:16:00,899
membrane trafficking on a superhighway

398
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:02,370
and you'll get to see what secretion

399
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,610
dynamics are really like with this

400
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,990
unicellular organism so I'd like to

401
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,389
start off with the real world of

402
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,680
mosquera flights listen to your

403
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:14,220
microbiologist and what I mean by that

404
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,889
is we have to recognize that Kara fights

405
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,500
and these land plant ancestors lived in

406
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,029
semi aquatic ecosystems and from an

407
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,940
evolutionary standpoint and from where

408
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,949
they are today there are some unique

409
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,920
mechanisms that they use in order to

410
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:31,759
survive in these habitats that could be

411
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,759
drying out salt content can go up and

412
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,590
I'm using this quote by a very famous

413
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,740
microbiologist William Costigan who

414
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:43,470
about 15 years ago in the preface of a

415
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,899
book basically said the vast majority of

416
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,720
microbial life on this planet doesn't

417
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,639
reside in suspensions but lives in

418
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,399
highly complex communities that are

419
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,949
attached to surfaces and what cos

420
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,699
certain was talking about was that of a

421
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,210
biofilm

422
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,740
when we think about these small

423
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,230
terabytes they especially does igni

424
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,079
metallian terabytes there's for the most

425
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,910
part they're stuck to things and the

426
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,220
thing that they're stuck to can very

427
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,350
oftentimes it's a solid object but

428
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,410
cosmic 10 also said that the interface

429
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,969
between water and air constitutes a

430
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,940
surface for the formation of many

431
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,519
biofilms biofilms have been studied

432
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,110
primarily in bacteria and if you look at

433
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,049
them one of the things that you will

434
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,599
notice is that they have a very distinct

435
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:33,569
structure they're not just simple

436
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,089
colonies of bacteria are covered in

437
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:38,069
slime they have in these colonies they

438
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:40,649
have channels they have specific places

439
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:42,689
where you have different microorganisms

440
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,380
that might be in some kind of symbiotic

441
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,350
relationship appearing but the key thing

442
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,960
is one of the key components of the

443
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:54,569
biofilm is a polysaccharide or

444
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,808
proteoglycan sheath that is produced in

445
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:57,388
law

446
00:17:54,808 --> 00:18:00,628
amounts that forms these unique habitats

447
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:02,908
and I will tell you that Desmond's and

448
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:06,748
many of the Karaites including pentium

449
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:08,610
are organisms that produce extensive EPS

450
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:10,740
states how much

451
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:13,798
how about microgram quantities per cell

452
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,509
this is in laboratory culture so once

453
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,668
again it's cheating a little bit but

454
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,579
they produce enormous amounts of

455
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:24,419
polysaccharides it's a something that

456
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:27,388
seems to be a major mechanism for these

457
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,028
organism survival alright so let's take

458
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:32,428
a look at the EPS you can look at these

459
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:34,618
with antibodies raised against the EPS

460
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,590
and this is a cell that had the EPS

461
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:40,109
washed out and labeled it with its anti

462
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:42,749
EPS antibody after the cell was kept in

463
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:45,269
culture for maybe an hour or so so it's

464
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:48,028
producing incredible amounts of this

465
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:50,159
polysaccharide okay you could study

466
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:52,919
these things also by using fluorescent

467
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:56,100
beads we can look at the production

468
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,169
rates of EPS by taking fluorescent beads

469
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,748
incubating are taking the cells and

470
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,450
incubating in them and walk how these

471
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:06,808
fluorescent beads are pushed out now

472
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,470
what does pen IAM and what do these EPS

473
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:12,388
compounds do for Desmond's and some of

474
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,788
the other ko fights they use it for

475
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:17,398
gliding that is they secrete the

476
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:20,038
polysaccharide from one area of the cell

477
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:21,569
it's very hygroscopic so when it comes

478
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,778
out of the backside of the cell it

479
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:27,839
swells with water and that propels the

480
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:29,609
organism in a particular direction but

481
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,949
more importantly it's used for

482
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:36,209
achievement on a surface and performing

483
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:38,249
biofilms Linda Graham who I told you

484
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,259
about just a few minutes ago she spent

485
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:43,139
some time in the late 1990s and early

486
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:46,829
2000s looking at some of the bacteria

487
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:49,048
found in the EPS biofilm feats of some

488
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:51,829
Kara fights and it was a unique

489
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:54,599
assortment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria

490
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:56,579
sulfate-reducing bacteria that there

491
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,339
really were true biofilm communities

492
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:03,058
associated with these on EPS sheets that

493
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:05,069
you find with things like titanium also

494
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:06,509
just keep in mind as you'll get the

495
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:08,669
scene a little bit that there's

496
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:11,759
site-specific secretion

497
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,130
okay that is when they make contact with

498
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,410
a surface and they want to secrete ups

499
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,130
they do it in particular parts of the

500
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,630
cell so what is this stuff well I know

501
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,780
it's a Friday afternoon and I'm not

502
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,780
going to go into detail but um what the

503
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:33,349
EPS is is a very complex polysaccharide

504
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:36,629
or excuse me or aggregation of

505
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:41,099
polysaccharides and it's very very

506
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:43,680
unique it's not a black uronic acid it's

507
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,539
not a galactic acid um based

508
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,269
polysaccharide it's a glucuronic acid

509
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:52,470
based polysaccharide with lots of lots

510
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:56,690
of xylose and chuco's and we've done a

511
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:58,829
little bit of work on the composition on

512
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,110
under high light conditions and their

513
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:04,049
high temperature conditions and the one

514
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:07,490
particular condition that really changes

515
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,769
the EPS is that of high temperature

516
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,049
where we lose uronic acids we have a

517
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,539
decrease in a couple of the main sugars

518
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,450
three lengths yukos and 3/4 length gram

519
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,819
those and terminal galactose residues go

520
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,890
down so there are changes in the

521
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,109
polysaccharide composition under this

522
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,770
stress so one of the things we're doing

523
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:31,019
right now is taking a look at the EPS in

524
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:33,869
its secretion under various stress

525
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,579
conditions alright the second thing I

526
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:38,369
want to talk about is that of the cell

527
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,379
wall once again it only has this

528
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:43,739
organism only has a primary cell wall

529
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:47,730
and the expansion dynamics can be

530
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:51,299
studied quite easily just to review for

531
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:53,279
you the primary cell wall cell wall that

532
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,919
is produced when an organism is

533
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,660
expanding remember we have cellulose

534
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,880
which is the load-bearing component of

535
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,060
the cell wall we have cross-linking Hemi

536
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,310
cellulose --is and and pectins in

537
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:07,259
pentium the thing that sort of hits your

538
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,839
right between the eyes are the pectins

539
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:13,799
because it has it advertised on its

540
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:17,189
surface pectins are polymers of galaki

541
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,879
Roenick acid and other sugars and this

542
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,380
picture is a little bit complicated but

543
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,270
you could have

544
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,060
several different types of pectin

545
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:30,000
subdomains you could have pectin just

546
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,619
made up of galactic acid and those would

547
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,359
be the home of galaki Ronan's and then

548
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:35,729
you could come to some of the most

549
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,740
complicated biopolymers on the planet

550
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,620
things called the RAM the galactose and

551
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:44,309
in particular Ram no galaki ronan one on

552
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:46,769
the side chains are extremely extremely

553
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:50,339
diverse and they can get a very very

554
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:52,440
complex or polysaccharide to study so we

555
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,329
were interested in the smooth pectin the

556
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Homa galacto Ronan's that don't have any

557
00:22:54,329 --> 00:23:01,799
side chains and RG one or an electronic

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,170
like your own n1 and that's the hairy

559
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,389
pectin and it's primarily because it has

560
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,610
these side chains

561
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,240
alright so with pentium hey what did we

562
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,279
find

563
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,069
well along with co-workers at the

564
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,049
University of Copenhagen we looked at

565
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:18,539
isolated cell walls and looked at the

566
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:20,819
chemical composition and then some

567
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,259
carbohydrate microarray analysis using a

568
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,079
variety of different monoclonal

569
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:28,829
antibodies was used so here we have

570
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:33,089
pentium cell walls that were basically

571
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:35,429
separated into a CD ta a pectin fraction

572
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:38,519
then an MeOH or more heavy cellulosic

573
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:42,420
fraction and then a dachshund fraction

574
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:43,470
and what we find in Pentium is that we

575
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,600
have the pectins

576
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,059
we have homo galaki Ronan and we have

577
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,149
our key one we have cellulose we have

578
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,220
Arab no black down proteins and I really

579
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,660
don't have time to talk about nor can I

580
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,029
tell you much about some of the other

581
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,060
polymers but in many ways similar to

582
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:03,660
what you find in land plants we did a

583
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:05,549
similar study on at the University of

584
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,680
Georgia the complex carbohydrate

585
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,619
Research Center and what you find are

586
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,660
once again your Peck dens and then a

587
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,339
whole bunch of a rabbit ogle act and

588
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,910
something or others whether you belong

589
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:20,909
to our g1 or a GPS it's a big mystery in

590
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:24,420
actually many areas of cell wall biology

591
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:27,180
so what does the Pentium cell wall look

592
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,430
like well you can get cell walls off

593
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,090
Pentium quite easily and that's by

594
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,250
sonicated

595
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:34,470
okay you don't have to do complex

596
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,250
extractions you just grow the cells up

597
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,230
put them on ice put

598
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,089
little bit of detergent into a buffer

599
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,849
and sonic ate them and this is what you

600
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:45,849
get and the thing that is most

601
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,469
outstanding represented by this inner

602
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:50,439
circle over here is what we call the

603
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,410
pectin lattice this is homo galaki ronan

604
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,190
that is complex with calcium to form a

605
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,500
very distinct lattice okay it's a series

606
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,230
of very thick and Phi rolls some of them

607
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,589
are branched they come together and they

608
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,079
terminate outwards or if you were let's

609
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,399
say microorganism landing on the Pentium

610
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,619
surface and you wanted to get a side

611
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,110
view this is what it would probably look

612
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:16,479
like you could then use a little bit of

613
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:18,219
ki later and you can remove some of the

614
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,670
calcium and what you can see hopefully

615
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:25,289
are literally thousands of fibrils about

616
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:27,789
one to two nanometers in thickness are

617
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:30,909
probably the homo goal actor Onan that

618
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:33,759
has complex the calcium all right and

619
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:36,009
then from a team standpoint this is what

620
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,890
the wall looks like here's that Homa

621
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:41,170
black Llorona and lattice and what

622
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,690
happens is is that it enters into the

623
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,850
inner wall they are made up of cellulose

624
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,519
in this zone right over here these

625
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:50,740
little sort of indentations that you see

626
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,049
that are semi electron dense that's

627
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,500
called the medial layer so we have a

628
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:58,450
pectin outer wall smooth pectin outer

629
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,630
wall or home Agalloch your own an acid

630
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,430
outer wall and then we have this medial

631
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,970
there and then a cellulose inner layer

632
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:10,750
if we do some immuno labeling we can use

633
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,120
a monoclonal antibody called Jim 5 that

634
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,099
goes after relatively low esterified

635
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,129
pectin some of the lack your own in and

636
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:21,990
it is located here in the lattice and

637
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,700
also in this medial layer if you use

638
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,680
antibody that goes after the backbone

639
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,850
not two side chains but the backbone of

640
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:34,480
our g1 what you will find is that it is

641
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:37,599
only found in this medial layer so right

642
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,980
now this is my model nobody else is in

643
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,839
you'll have to forgive me I'm not an

644
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,509
artist though you might think I am all

645
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,879
right so here we have cellulose forming

646
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:47,259
the basis of the wall and then here we

647
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,050
have the home of the like your own ants

648
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:51,460
coming out and then the RG one is

649
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,470
think that's anchoring the home of the

650
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,319
lackey ronin it's probably looking at

651
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,660
some monster pecten domain which has

652
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,189
been recently described by Lita and

653
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,470
Deborah moanin at the University of

654
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,970
Georgia where we're not really dealing

655
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,180
with separate polymers we're just

656
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,289
looking at different geographic domains

657
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,350
pectins pectins are really complicated

658
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:13,480
and just to speculate a little bit it

659
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,849
may be that the RG one the black

660
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,150
component here is the thing that's

661
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:21,039
actually interacting with cellulose and

662
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:25,000
more and more evidence suggests that

663
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,980
pectins are more important than maybe

664
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,940
some of the classic hemicelluloses in

665
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,579
the way a cell wall expands all right so

666
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,269
then I just want to let you know that

667
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:40,119
the Houma galacto Ronin can be a label

668
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:43,240
using fluorescent probes and you can

669
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,039
then study subsequent pectin secretion

670
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,009
dynamics you can study expansion

671
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,190
dynamics so I just want to point out one

672
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:53,769
quick thing so here's Jim 5 and Jim 5

673
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,320
has been a very good antibody for

674
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,119
labeling pentium you could label it put

675
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,849
the cells back into culture and then

676
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:02,529
you'll the zone here in the middle um is

677
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:05,740
going to be where new wall material is

678
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:08,410
produced and if you look at the zone

679
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,870
you'll see this is the lattice this is

680
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,420
what it looks like but I just want to

681
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,879
spend a minute and tell you about some

682
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:19,500
new valuable probes that are used for

683
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,090
studying pectins in plant cells and

684
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,700
they're really remarkable so if you can

685
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:26,740
just remember what those teeth excuse me

686
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,809
those SEM images of what the lattice

687
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,779
looked like and then take a look at

688
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:35,109
something like this ok this is one of

689
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:37,329
the new probes used for labeling pectins

690
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:39,339
and what makes this really nice is that

691
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:41,319
you can actually see some of those

692
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:44,709
thickened fibers coming up to the point

693
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,319
far more detailed than we got using the

694
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,690
antibodies these probes that I'm going

695
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,389
to describe to you are wonderful because

696
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,580
they're small molecular weight much

697
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,920
smaller than using antibodies and they

698
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,480
can penetrate deeply into the cell wall

699
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,880
and provide you with a lot of wonderful

700
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,299
detail all right so what are these

701
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,880
probes okay oh I can give you this

702
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:07,990
wonderful detail well one of them is

703
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,840
called the reciprocal

704
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,339
oligosaccharide Pro and I must tell you

705
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,289
it's really easy and these were

706
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:19,179
developed by a person named Joseph Robin

707
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:21,369
at the University of Copenhagen and

708
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,049
here's the way it works all right here's

709
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:25,179
a typical home on the lackey ronan

710
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,430
here's the galaki Roenick acids that are

711
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,440
lined up and these blue dots over here

712
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,330
to represent the methyl groups that are

713
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,180
attached to the carboxylic acid group

714
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:36,220
that you typically find in pectins that

715
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,250
have not yet been secreted it makes

716
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,319
sense to in effect neutralize the

717
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,180
negative charges on the carboxylic acid

718
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,549
groups because the pectin would be too

719
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,580
sticky and stick into vesicles so most

720
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:51,190
pectins are produced or methyl e2 the

721
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:54,369
Houma Galecki Ronin the electronic acid

722
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,890
residues are methylated well typically

723
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:58,539
what happens in the development of

724
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,230
pectins when it's secreted is they get

725
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:04,869
the esterified daredi esterified by an

726
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,759
enzyme well known as I'm known as pectin

727
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,919
methyl esters Walt mentioned that in

728
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,259
just a minute but what you do is you

729
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,710
remove the methyl groups and here is and

730
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:17,289
here are your negatively charged to the

731
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,779
electronic acids well wouldn't it be a

732
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:23,200
great idea to get something that is

733
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:26,170
roughly the same size as this that might

734
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,910
have positive charge that you can match

735
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:32,470
up and you can you could take chitin

736
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:34,240
orchitis in fragments and what you can

737
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,130
do is add them to pectins

738
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,839
and you can get the kinase in fragments

739
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,870
that at different levels of

740
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,059
polymerization and they'll match up with

741
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:46,899
the pectin with the Houma galacto Ronin

742
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:49,720
what you can do is you can add a tag a

743
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,360
fluorescent tag a goal tag and that's

744
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,980
where you get some really really

745
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,000
beautiful pictures one of the new probes

746
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,349
being used these reciprocal

747
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,069
oligosaccharide probes in this case one

748
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:05,139
called cos um is where you are binding

749
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:07,240
positively charged amino groups on

750
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,090
Qaida's needles little saccharides with

751
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,460
that of the carbon carboxylic acid

752
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:15,639
groups on the oligo Galacta or nights a

753
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,389
wonderful type of label there's another

754
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,759
one it's even easier

755
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:22,008
these are illegal galactic acid probes

756
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,288
and this picture is a little difficult

757
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:26,899
to discern but the blue little squiggles

758
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:28,608
that's the home of galaki ronan and the

759
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:32,538
little yellow dots in there that's

760
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:34,939
calcium so you have after it's in D

761
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:37,009
esterified and what will happen is you

762
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,349
have calcium coming in and it will form

763
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,179
these links and that's where you get

764
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:44,479
something like the lattice that you see

765
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:47,269
in Pentium all right well the brilliant

766
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:50,298
idea that they had was what about if we

767
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:52,190
were to take known illegal galactic your

768
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:54,528
own I dragged mints and put a probe on

769
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:58,038
it let's say like Alexa fluor 488 and

770
00:31:54,528 --> 00:32:00,409
then incubate cells where the pectin was

771
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:01,009
just being secreted and as it was the

772
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:03,739
esterified

773
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:05,798
it would match up with these external

774
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:10,190
the gold black your own eyes that have

775
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:13,819
alexa fluor 48 and these conjugates have

776
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,409
been very very helpful as well and just

777
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:18,678
this past year in the plant kernel you

778
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:21,259
also have had a nice sort of screening

779
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,669
of many different plants that use this

780
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:25,249
and this is where you get these

781
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:27,889
beautiful images I mean wonderful new

782
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:31,999
probes that are coming out all right so

783
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:34,638
that's the the pectin component of the

784
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:37,608
wall the inner wall layer is made of

785
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:40,248
cellulose so once again here's the outer

786
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:44,028
wall the inner layer has cellulose in it

787
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:46,459
this is a co label of Calca floor with

788
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:49,069
the antibody 5 and you could see

789
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:50,839
the cellulose on the inside another

790
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,819
probe that we have been using that's

791
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:55,009
just come out recently is a carbohydrate

792
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:58,519
binding module that goes after

793
00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:01,128
crystalline cellulose but researchers in

794
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,278
Portugal had an ingenious idea and what

795
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:05,778
they've done is they've hooked AFP on it

796
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,239
and therefore you could pick up

797
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:12,878
cellulose microfibrils that are found in

798
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:16,788
the wall we can then use CBM

799
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:19,248
carbohydrate binding modules of PFP to

800
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:23,328
label the cellulose and here's the

801
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:26,649
pectin on the outside so the inner wall

802
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:29,269
layer consists of cellulose and

803
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:30,859
different orientations of cellulose

804
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,558
microfibrils

805
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:36,500
okay so cellulose is the load-bearing

806
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,819
component of the cell okay it is the

807
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,450
thing that's holding the wall together

808
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:44,898
not the pectins I really have not really

809
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,490
certain clue as to what the lattice the

810
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,379
pectin lattice is actually doing

811
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,870
probably something to do with adhesion

812
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,630
but when you do some simple experiments

813
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:56,808
like you use a microtubule oh I'm

814
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,700
inhibitor like a p.m. you get rid of the

815
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:01,970
cortical microtubules that are found in

816
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,940
the cell center and you weaken you cause

817
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,720
the cellulose wall to be thinner because

818
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,300
microtubules are controlling the

819
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,608
deposition of cellulose and then you get

820
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,190
turgor pressure calling these causing

821
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:17,239
these swellings or what about treating

822
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:19,460
your cells in an e beat a EDTA a key

823
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,009
later solution we could get rid of the

824
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,720
pectin this is Jim five label and the

825
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,119
cell could be put back in a culture and

826
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,489
ultimately it will produce more pectin

827
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:32,030
but for several days it doesn't need it

828
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:33,588
who knows or you can put the cells in

829
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,369
spectate lice and you could literally

830
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:40,070
strip off the outer layer fluorescent

831
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,740
image with Kym five here's your SEM

832
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,980
here's your TM and this is a cell that's

833
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,898
labeled with Jim five not a speck of the

834
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,358
homo galaki Ronan put the cell in the

835
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:53,239
culture it's as happy as can be in in a

836
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,819
couple of days it will produce more home

837
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,819
look like your own aunt how does the

838
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,769
wall expand well the wall expands from

839
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:05,260
the center on out

840
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:08,449
so hoops sorry about that alright so

841
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,670
I'll make this a little bit easier so

842
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:16,159
the center of the cell where the nucleus

843
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:18,588
is that is called the isthmus and this

844
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,868
is the zone where new wall materials are

845
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:22,880
produced and it pushes old wall material

846
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,608
out so basically the cell is expanding

847
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,500
in that direction this cartoon if you

848
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:29,779
maybe a little better idea of what's

849
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,510
going on this zone right over here would

850
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,310
be new wall gets more and more walls

851
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,109
pushing the old wall out and then

852
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:39,170
ultimately you get cell division with

853
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:41,598
daughter cells and very very simple I

854
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,530
mean black Edurne Desmond's have that

855
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,570
symmetry but it's a very easy thing

856
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,360
any of the case to understand how

857
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:53,440
expansion occurs and the central zone is

858
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,720
known as the isthmus all right so what

859
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,170
we have done is we have looked at dis

860
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:02,049
Mazzone expansion what happens is that

861
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,670
you have pectins okay Houma collect your

862
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,570
own ends that are methyl is terrified

863
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:10,720
that are secreted here in this central

864
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,000
zone this is miss then they are Dias

865
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,429
terrified by pectin methyl ester ace and

866
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,130
now we go to Jim 5 and this is where

867
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:21,309
this would be located this is Jim 7

868
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:24,340
label here the esterified pectin this

869
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,049
dark zone over here is where this would

870
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,320
be found and then over on either side

871
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,450
you have the pectin that has become the

872
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,309
esterified that picked up calcium so the

873
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:35,409
pectin is now being pushed to the

874
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:38,469
outside and the cellulose as well and

875
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:42,009
you get this bipolar displacement and

876
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:43,989
here's an Fe SEM view showing we believe

877
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,290
some of the the pectin Homa collect your

878
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:50,609
own M fibrils before they have complex

879
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:53,590
calcium in form this particular lattice

880
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:56,230
right cellulose is the first polymer

881
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,490
that is produced in this expansion zone

882
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,809
the microfibrils are deposited in

883
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:04,779
perpendicular direction to the direction

884
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:08,500
of expansion and are associated with the

885
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,900
cortical band of microtubules so here is

886
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,059
just a simple second here's the

887
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,970
cellulose here in the s Mazzone and

888
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:18,519
here's the lattice that's being formed

889
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:20,589
here's a glancing section where you can

890
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:23,019
see the cellulose microfibrils they're

891
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,780
in this orientation and cell expansion

892
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:28,929
bella is going in this horizontal

893
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:31,450
direction if you look at the cell just

894
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:34,000
underneath the plasma membrane you have

895
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:36,669
the series of cortical microtubules that

896
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,949
are probably directing the way in which

897
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,930
cellulose is deposited so any loss of

898
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:44,409
course was made by sesay complexes on

899
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:46,659
the plasma membrane and here's the court

900
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:50,199
of Cole microtubule band as well

901
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:53,079
okay so shortly after the cellulose is

902
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,779
produced the the RG one is deposited

903
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,119
this is with the antibody in row are you

904
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,640
one that I showed you before and then

905
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,829
and we start to see the lattice that

906
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,889
starts to form and starts pushing out

907
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:08,230
the cold cell wall material all right

908
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:11,048
one other thing the cell wall has some

909
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,710
sticky business and a sticky business is

910
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:18,909
adhesion if you take cells and you place

911
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,499
them on a substrate and on that

912
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:21,940
substrate you let them sit for a while

913
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,889
they'll come together and they will

914
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,849
stick and they will at fixed to a

915
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:30,038
substrate very very firmly and we were

916
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:32,650
interested in what this sticky stuff

917
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:36,369
might be so you could take soaps sorry

918
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:37,809
you could take some beads poly sere

919
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,430
beads and put them around the cell

920
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,109
that's just been washed in within a

921
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:43,748
matter of seconds there's something

922
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:46,690
sticky on the outside surface so what's

923
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:49,838
responsible for this thick eNOS that

924
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,849
allows the cell to adhere to some kind

925
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,369
of a substrate well we can use a

926
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:56,440
monoclonal antibody known as Jim 13

927
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:59,849
which is probably the gold standard for

928
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,039
identifying Arab no galactic proteins in

929
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:05,140
plants and what we find is that on the

930
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,769
outer surface of the wall you get a very

931
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:10,598
distinct label the Jim 13 labeling is on

932
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:12,729
the outer surface of the wall we can do

933
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,640
the Co labeling with Kalpa floor or with

934
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,528
two on antibodies of pectin antibody and

935
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:22,480
this is probably the better picture to

936
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:23,858
see here is the Jim 13 in red and over

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,650
here in green is the gym five so it's

938
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:30,518
found on the outside of the pectin

939
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,980
lattice the Jim 13 material also adheres

940
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:35,498
to substrates and it leaves a footprint

941
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,019
here's a cell that was placed on a

942
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:40,058
coverslip okay and we just left there

943
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:42,278
just for a few minutes and we push the

944
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:43,869
cell off rolled it off here's the

945
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:46,989
footprint and you can see where some of

946
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:49,210
the Jim 13 label came on so it appears

947
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:52,449
to be the glue all right

948
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:55,869
Western analysis what we have found

949
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:58,088
amusing Jim 13 we find that we have a

950
00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:02,048
couple of high molecular weight bands

951
00:39:58,088 --> 00:40:04,179
here in cell wall fractions and also we

952
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,579
find it in the EPS fraction and we're

953
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:07,960
not exactly sure what this means here

954
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,730
but it probably means some of the

955
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,010
adhesive material has been sloth off

956
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:15,880
this is in addition to that EPS

957
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:19,360
that gel that is produced by on the

958
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,210
organism and then just real quickly if

959
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,940
we look at the TEM here's that pectin

960
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,699
lattice and here's the fibrils a that

961
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,860
our Jim 13 positive and here's sort of a

962
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:31,779
an overview it forms sort of like a

963
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,920
little reticulated network here on the

964
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:39,310
outside immuno gold labeling here's kim

965
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,110
13 it corresponds to what we saw with

966
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:47,139
immunofluorescence so there appears to

967
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:49,390
be a fiber layer of black damp proteins

968
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:53,319
that are found on the outside and may be

969
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:55,839
important in sticking the outer v roller

970
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,240
layer is not attached to the home of

971
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,789
galacto ronan we could get rid of the

972
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,459
home little actor Onan and these five

973
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:06,460
rolls will still appear they go into the

974
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:10,929
inner part of the wall all right so the

975
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:13,030
the pectin lattice is for at least part

976
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:16,239
of this this is kind of a story that's

977
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,040
still being told you know don't know

978
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,039
what it is here we could strip off the

979
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:23,170
outer home of the lackey ronan and there

980
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,380
are the five rolls so they're very

981
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,750
resistant and the outer filer layer is

982
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,329
laid down at the Isthmus very early on

983
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,210
here's a the isthmus zone in an

984
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:37,389
expanding wall and already we see that

985
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,250
there are these ADP like fibrils that

986
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:42,279
were calling a mage illegal spot like

987
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:46,179
fibrils so the sticky material is very

988
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,080
very significant and we find it in a lot

989
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:51,009
of organisms

990
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:53,710
now something Trevor suggested back last

991
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,510
year was why do we not take a look and

992
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,929
see what happens if we incubate the

993
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:00,490
cells with something like phospholipid

994
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:02,349
see to see if there might be an anchor

995
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:05,349
that's found in the plasma membrane

996
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:06,699
perhaps you have these aging peas going

997
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:09,909
through the wall and anchoring in the

998
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:13,119
plasma membrane well to make a long

999
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:15,429
story short here's our control cell here

1000
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,449
is phospholipase C treated cells we lose

1001
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:22,960
most of the AG P and here's a TM image

1002
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:25,509
and this is a zone where during

1003
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,298
phospholipase treating treatment we've

1004
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:31,269
those particular fibrils so this

1005
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:34,059
suggests that a GPS and a GP like

1006
00:42:31,268 --> 00:42:37,178
molecules are responsible for adhesion

1007
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:38,889
but I just wanna in this particular part

1008
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:42,369
by just saying is that we're just

1009
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:44,108
learning about a GPS in terabytes and it

1010
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:47,380
may been very important in the evolution

1011
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:50,048
of land plants sticky material that if

1012
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,119
we look at things like spirogyra and we

1013
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:53,559
wound spirogyra filaments they formed

1014
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,269
these rhizoids and then if you label

1015
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,609
them with gym 13 the only time you ever

1016
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:59,678
see arrive no galactic proteins is in

1017
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:01,598
the wound response or here in that

1018
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,148
organism chloric ibis that I mentioned

1019
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,669
the oddball of the Kara fights its

1020
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:10,838
sheath which allows it to stick the

1021
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:12,969
substrates is made of a GP so a GP may

1022
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,469
be the superglue of Kara fights and may

1023
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:18,789
have been very very important in

1024
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:21,729
evolution so finally what I like to just

1025
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:25,769
do is just tell you some just real good

1026
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:29,888
things about membrane trafficking in the

1027
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:32,198
like Pentium and question is is how does

1028
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:33,999
a plant cell expands well we should know

1029
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:34,539
that it expands basically because of two

1030
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:37,118
reasons

1031
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:40,179
the force that's causing expansion is

1032
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,019
that of internal turgor pressure and the

1033
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:46,689
cell wall and modifications of the cell

1034
00:43:44,018 --> 00:43:49,148
wall to causing slippage of the

1035
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:52,268
cellulose microfibrils allows for

1036
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:55,388
controlled expansion and in the

1037
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:58,448
world.the plants we have diffusive polar

1038
00:43:55,389 --> 00:44:02,380
growth mechanisms where we have wall

1039
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:04,509
polymers added two different possibly

1040
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,088
evenly distributed areas in the wall and

1041
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,889
then you get sort of a more even

1042
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:11,588
expansion of the wall and on the

1043
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:13,959
opposite end of that spectrum you get

1044
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:15,788
polar growth and that's where wall

1045
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:18,458
synthesis like in the palm tube or a

1046
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:21,309
root here is concentrated here at the

1047
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:23,498
tip alright so in pentium to finish the

1048
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:25,989
story up right Pentium expansion

1049
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:30,038
dynamics I want to leave you with this

1050
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:33,219
this organism is a lean a polysaccharide

1051
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,439
producing machine I mean this organism

1052
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:39,159
like many of the Desmond's

1053
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:42,879
is perfect organism for study in secret

1054
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:45,009
dynamics in plant cells right and one

1055
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,950
thing that I just want to reiterate is

1056
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:50,950
that it's here in this zone right over

1057
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:53,589
here right in the Isthmus where we have

1058
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:56,529
the wall materials produced at first and

1059
00:44:53,590 --> 00:45:00,490
being secreted at first cell wall

1060
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:02,680
expansion requires a very distinct

1061
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,449
cytoskeletal network and this is kind of

1062
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:07,629
an intriguing thing that we were

1063
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:11,139
studying a couple years ago so if you do

1064
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:14,110
immuno labeling of the particle micro

1065
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:16,269
tubular on network infinium what you

1066
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:18,370
find in a normal cell before expansion

1067
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:21,099
is you find a band of microtubules

1068
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:24,519
cortical microtubules then what happens

1069
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:26,319
is before expansion you get satellite

1070
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,090
bands appearing from the mother strand

1071
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,090
and they start to move away from the

1072
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:35,740
mother strand on as the cell starts to

1073
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:37,000
expand great alright then in this

1074
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:38,319
picture over here you can see they're

1075
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,650
starting to move away and they're going

1076
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,840
to mark the zone where are the Isthmus

1077
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,829
is in the daughter cell cell has even

1078
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,250
defined it yet

1079
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:50,619
so it's in many ways pretending it's

1080
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,449
kind of a pre pre phobic prophase fan

1081
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:56,190
it's predicting the plane of cell

1082
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:59,489
division numb to division cycles away

1083
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:02,289
right it's it's identifying where the

1084
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:05,139
Isthmus is going to be in the daughter

1085
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:07,539
cells well what happens is when the cell

1086
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:10,119
goes into cell division we lose this

1087
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:12,730
cortical microtubule band is probably

1088
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:16,630
contributing to the spindle and also to

1089
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:18,789
the sign of kinetic device and then if

1090
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:20,769
you look at the daughter cells here is

1091
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:22,360
okay was over here on this mother cell

1092
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:25,269
here's one of the daughter cells and it

1093
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,210
has this particular band all right so

1094
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:31,509
these cortical micro tubular bands were

1095
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:33,849
kind of a surprise to us and just real

1096
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,410
quick they had multiple functions they

1097
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:37,809
marked a plaintive division there are

1098
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:40,509
source of microtubules for the spindle

1099
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:42,369
and the psychokinetic apparatus probably

1100
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,950
direct cellulose in --this is involved

1101
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:46,539
in nuclear movement which certainly we

1102
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:48,549
could talk about a unique way of moving

1103
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:51,789
the nucleus in Desmond's

1104
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,110
right also we have cortical actin bands

1105
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,239
that are very

1106
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:58,450
did all this here's wrote me phalloidin

1107
00:46:55,239 --> 00:47:02,139
labeling of pen IAM and these ropes

1108
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:05,859
these cables of actin are found in the

1109
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:08,559
cell and at the time of expansion what

1110
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,230
will happen is you get these bands yet

1111
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,860
line up with those cortical microtubule

1112
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:17,019
bands and it's very likely that this

1113
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,440
cytoskeleton network excuse me decide on

1114
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:21,909
modal network is interfacing with the

1115
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,659
cytoskeletal network for the accurate

1116
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:27,219
delivery of secretory materials all

1117
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:30,849
right but the key thing here is the

1118
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:34,149
secretory apparatus opinion is truly

1119
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:36,630
amazing and what i want to just point

1120
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,760
out to you is that here's pentium and

1121
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,740
here's of chloroplasts and these dark

1122
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,320
zones over here are valleys of cytoplasm

1123
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:46,029
you do not have big vacuoles in this

1124
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,519
organism there vacuoles but they're

1125
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,230
small and meandering it is in these

1126
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:52,989
little zones over here

1127
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:55,960
that you have the cytoplasm and that's

1128
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:58,629
where the funds things start so here's

1129
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,150
just a simple longitudinal section of

1130
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:04,320
pentium and we went on a hunt to see how

1131
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:06,970
many Golgi bodies a single cell has and

1132
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:11,230
so this is just one portion of the cell

1133
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:14,859
and we think there's between 125 and 150

1134
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:18,250
Golgi bodies alright so then what we

1135
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,890
take a look at is what does Pentium um

1136
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:23,380
have that's different than higher plants

1137
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:25,859
alright so as we get close to this this

1138
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:29,019
is my performance art part of the

1139
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:32,590
presentation so in higher plants I'm a

1140
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:34,480
Golgi body and Golgi bodies in a rounded

1141
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,950
axis for example moving around they're

1142
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,780
moving around and all of a sudden they

1143
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:39,519
need to secrete something over there so

1144
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,200
then you come in this is ER of course if

1145
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,909
you didn't know that they'll dock in and

1146
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:50,619
then the Golgi starts shooting things

1147
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:52,809
out they're stationary rather what they

1148
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:54,699
have over here is they produce a series

1149
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:57,880
of vesicles that get caught up on that

1150
00:48:54,699 --> 00:49:00,399
actin network here on the periphery of

1151
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,210
the cell they always have a ready supply

1152
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,910
of secretory vesicles for EPS for a wall

1153
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,588
material and that's the stuff that

1154
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:11,348
Motul so whenever they need that

1155
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:12,788
material some kind of signal cascade

1156
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,740
probably occurs and let's get those

1157
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:16,990
vesicles to that zone and let's start

1158
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:19,838
secreting this is true for other

1159
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:22,029
Desmond's as well so very different

1160
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:25,449
Golgi bodies are not mobile they are

1161
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:27,069
stuck in the cytoplasm and just real

1162
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:28,480
quick that the Golgi bodies are quite

1163
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:30,909
unique

1164
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,980
lots of cisterna they have a trans-golgi

1165
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:34,989
network but for you people who are cell

1166
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,490
biologists let me just point out I've

1167
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:38,739
never seen a secretory vesicle

1168
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:40,899
associated with a tgn in pentium and

1169
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:43,029
that's not what you find in on land

1170
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,818
plants so there are some differences

1171
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:51,519
each Golgi body can produce both wall

1172
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:54,489
materials and the EPS ETS secretion is

1173
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:57,699
can be focused here's a cell that was

1174
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:59,769
placed on a substrate and we fixed it

1175
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,989
for electron microscopy we are looking

1176
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:05,679
at the zone where EPS was being produced

1177
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:11,259
there's the picture of it oh sorry about

1178
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:14,139
this guys and here's the substrate down

1179
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,599
here and what we see in this zone where

1180
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:19,358
the cell is attached we have these

1181
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:22,630
vesicles that pull and release the EPS

1182
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:26,019
so there obviously are some interesting

1183
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:28,240
signals and wall expansion zone we have

1184
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:30,929
wall vesicles that will come up and

1185
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:34,088
contribute to pectins into whatever else

1186
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:36,578
we also think we've identified a group

1187
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:40,028
of small vesicles probably containing

1188
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:41,769
Sesay that are going to come into this

1189
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:42,909
particular zone as well we don't know

1190
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:46,568
for certain but that's an ongoing

1191
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:49,269
project and the last thing is that there

1192
00:50:46,568 --> 00:50:51,608
is an endo siddik pathway in pentium in

1193
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:53,889
all Desmond's and it's really really

1194
00:50:51,608 --> 00:51:01,389
quite the state and we can use things

1195
00:50:53,889 --> 00:51:03,879
like the FM guys 464 143 and the dye is

1196
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:05,739
immediately take it up it gets on the

1197
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,289
cytoplasmic streaming network and then

1198
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:11,858
it they kind of come together in fuse in

1199
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:13,480
a very distinct vacuolar network okay

1200
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:16,028
some of these vacuoles are autophagy

1201
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,818
they've got membranes in them but a very

1202
00:51:16,028 --> 00:51:20,590
unique vacuolar system that's involved

1203
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:23,469
in endocytosis

1204
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:25,630
so with that let me just say that if

1205
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:27,579
you're interested in secretory dynamics

1206
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,980
in plants for the production of cell

1207
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:31,989
walls or whatever this is an organism

1208
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,059
that I want us to sell you on it for

1209
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:37,179
only 995 I'll give you a know I mean

1210
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:39,480
it's a I think has tremendous potential

1211
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:42,429
and we'll forget this particular picture

1212
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,380
and let me finish up by saying that

1213
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:46,179
there are many many different projects

1214
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:50,559
that we're looking into we're looking

1215
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:53,099
into stress in secretory we're looking

1216
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,920
at the way in which the cytoskeleton and

1217
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:59,710
a membrane trafficking network org and I

1218
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:19,539
won't bore you with this but I like to

1219
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:36,250
finish up and say thank you to this I've

1220
00:52:19,539 --> 00:53:29,949
ever had in my life and the National

1221
00:52:36,250 --> 00:53:32,139
Science Foundation yeah yes yeah well I

1222
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:34,449
the details of because I don't know the

1223
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:37,000
details of it but obviously there's

1224
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:38,710
tremendous about a photosynthate that is

1225
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,119
directed into yes and if you grow these

1226
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,670
things in culture under high light

1227
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,980
conditions the amount of EPs for example

1228
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,210
over let's say a 24-hour period will

1229
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,289
increase three times

1230
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:52,059
so this EPS means something to them and

1231
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:55,000
they put a lot of photosynthetic

1232
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:56,859
material into it it's a great question

1233
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,880
your question have I've always had about

1234
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:02,769
organisms like this and other parasites

1235
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,130
that are found for example in these

1236
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:08,019
ephemeral pools is you'll see these

1237
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,150
things bloom and they'll produce this

1238
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:13,179
incredible amount of EPs it's like green

1239
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:16,420
jello and then about a week here it's

1240
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:18,960
gone I mean the Eco dynamics with this

1241
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,159
and what that's being used for in the

1242
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:30,608
carbon cycle of that ecosystem

1243
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:34,179
nobody knows yes there is no Golgi

1244
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:37,539
bodies there okay and for most the time

1245
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:39,279
before expansion is its you had the

1246
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:41,139
nucleus and then you have cytoplasm

1247
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,319
around the nucleus and you could just

1248
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:46,808
see the typical vesicles but it's know

1249
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,599
very little ER and no Golgi bodies

1250
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:51,910
they're in the lobes of cytoplasmic

1251
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:59,260
lobes of that are defined by the

1252
00:54:51,909 --> 00:55:01,088
chloroplasts yeah so the active network

1253
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,700
goes all the way through so if you're

1254
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:05,289
looking at for example vesicles you want

1255
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:07,419
to see what happens it just doesn't stop

1256
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:08,798
at the Isthmus they will go around and

1257
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,318
then somewhere during the expansion

1258
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,480
obviously pulls a ball precursor

1259
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:18,298
containing vesicles are pulled off into

1260
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,298
the Isthmus or for the expansion process

1261
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,440
well the only thing I could tell you is

1262
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,750
what Charles

1263
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,450
at the University of Maryland on has

1264
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:57,050
reported and his point is it's just it's

1265
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:59,179
been a evolutionary reduction process it

1266
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:14,990
can't really you know really explain it

1267
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:16,368
and if very well could be because you

1268
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:18,489
know they've had four hundred and fifty

1269
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:21,530
million years as well too

1270
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:25,250
yeah yeah I would assume that there is a

1271
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:26,690
lot on both the point I was trying to

1272
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:29,329
make is that you know as far as looking

1273
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:32,659
for basic sub cellular dynamics you know

1274
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:34,640
this but I agree with you I mean it's a

1275
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:38,690
really fascinating story right now about

1276
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:40,699
the phylogeny of late divergent era

1277
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,809
fights it's a story that I think is

1278
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:53,389
going to be we're going to learn a lot

1279
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:55,489
when we get more genomes out there this

1280
00:56:53,389 --> 00:57:01,059
has been a production of Cornell

1281
00:56:55,489 --> 00:57:01,059
University on the web at Cornell edu
