1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,910
um I appreciate the introduction the

4
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:11,128
chance to be here and share some of

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,740
research that we've been doing for many

6
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:17,550
years and ongoing um I had tried to

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,070
suggest that gosh give this talk but

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,060
Janice really wanted me do it and so I'm

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,778
Redbook is represented in spirit hmm at

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,649
Wisconsin my doctorate and and also

11
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,489
master's at Virginia was very much

12
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,019
focused on agricultural production and

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,810
externalities and problems specifically

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,370
water quality and other ecological

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,390
implications of contemporary farming

16
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,739
practice and became very interested in

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,230
Agri environmental policy basically

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,450
federal elements of it thank you for

19
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,599
coming the farm bill and the

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,760
conservation elements of the farm bill

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,789
and have followed that closely for 25

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,789
years I want to talk about is a kind of

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,129
glass a half-full glass half-empty story

24
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,500
about the potential to bring more

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,490
science and more data and more modeling

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,959
to bear on how we do conservation and

27
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:16,429
opportunities to use a more data rich

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:19,289
approach to inform how we spend money in

29
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,140
Agri environmental programs more

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,080
generally how conservation is advanced

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,790
whether it's funded by private dollars

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,640
whether it's funded by public dollars

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,510
whether it's funded by voluntary

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,460
investments by farmers and ranchers

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,710
that's the half full side of the story

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,559
the half empty side is to look at the

37
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,879
history and the politics of Agriculture

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,140
particularly in this country but

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,199
certainly Europe wouldn't be very

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,680
different in which the commitments to

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,930
conservation are mixed on the one hand

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,630
there are strong commitments throughout

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,909
agriculture and among consumers in the

44
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,890
general public and bureaucrats and

45
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,080
elected officials to stewardship and

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,939
conservation and sustainability on the

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,158
other hand we have bedrock commitments

48
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,008
to cheap food both of these things are

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,229
true so we're kind of left with well

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,659
which which flavor is going to come out

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,750
in a given decision or in a given moment

52
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:19,310
so that's the kind of big picture that I

53
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,310
want to try to talk about today

54
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,909
so the talk and I will explain each of

55
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,129
these terms

56
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,049
somebody told me they'd shared the title

57
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:32,389
with a friend and they said I don't know

58
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,290
what any of these words mean so we'll go

59
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:38,029
through that um

60
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:40,549
conservation not just in North America

61
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,430
in the Midwest one slide there from

62
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,890
India um not just traditional

63
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,580
conservation practices like buffer

64
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:51,979
strips contour plowing conservation

65
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,080
tillage integrated pest management but

66
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,149
also next generation conservation I'm

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,530
part of the leadership group for this

68
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,420
Cornell Institute for digital

69
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,419
agriculture which is on the cusp of

70
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:04,429
being launched and so we're interested

71
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:08,539
in kind of futuristic visions of

72
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:14,469
agriculture food and conservation just a

73
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:20,569
kind of conservative hopefully a forward

74
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:23,239
the opportunity and I think the the kind

75
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:25,780
of upside the exciting elements respect

76
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,860
to ecology is to advance the

77
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,560
cost-effectiveness of conservation if

78
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,620
you only have one dollar if you only

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,939
have one conservation contract to give

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,770
what should you do with that dollar or

81
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:39,280
that conservation contract could we use

82
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,959
data to characterize distributions of

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,780
landscapes of farming systems to capture

84
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,209
that variance and use it in a way that

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,759
informs investment decisions and the way

86
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,610
we structure contracts with farmers to

87
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,769
do conservation under cost-sharing

88
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,140
arrangements you have variability in

89
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,700
farmers willingness to participate in

90
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,159
the amount of money they want to be paid

91
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,109
for that willingness to accept we have

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,120
variability in landscapes we have

93
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,980
variability in conservation practices

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,560
the width of the buffer strip the

95
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,119
architecture the way the buffer strip is

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,250
installed the way the buffer strip is

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,829
maintained all of these things are

98
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,918
parameters that matter in terms of the

99
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,889
cost effectiveness that is the cost of

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,918
creating maintaining a conservation

101
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:32,000
practice the opportunity cost perhaps in

102
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:35,899
terms of loss of arable land and crop

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,509
yield and the benefits in terms of local

104
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:40,699
and regional ecosystem services so

105
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,740
on-farm conservation benefits might be

106
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,360
soil erosion control off-farm

107
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,160
conservation benefits might be

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,189
addressing hypoxia and so the promise is

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,140
using data using knowledge about spatial

110
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:57,680
distributions and economic distributions

111
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,439
to spend and target conservation dollars

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,689
effectively we also can imagine

113
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,870
assessing conservation programs

114
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:08,449
rigorously in a data rich environment to

115
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,230
breed more cost-effectiveness and better

116
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:14,060
outcomes and so as I said it's a kind of

117
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,680
glass half full glass half empty on the

118
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,769
one hand were confronted with great

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,600
opportunities to bring data to bear the

120
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:24,379
types of science you folks are doing in

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,820
terms of models alysus 10 informant

122
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:29,060
should be informing conservation

123
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:31,339
practice my sense is it's not informing

124
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,230
it as deeply and as fast as it should

125
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,349
and the historical friction that

126
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,689
constrains we introduce new ideas new

127
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,300
practices and new data into conservation

128
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:43,219
planning and administration of

129
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,340
conservation programs that's the

130
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,040
historical fiction I want to talk about

131
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:51,469
so on the one hand there's new energy

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,450
there's new sense of Agriculture's

133
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,840
relationship with environment which is

134
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,539
driving demand for farming differently

135
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,060
for renegotiating the social contract

136
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,569
with farmers for putting a candle under

137
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,149
Congress so they invest differently

138
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:10,759
similarly for USDA and natural resource

139
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:14,479
conservation services all of that's fine

140
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,730
but on the other hand the world was not

141
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,160
created yesterday we're stuck with a

142
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,620
history we're stuck with organizational

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,990
culture we're stuck with a variety of

144
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,439
relationships that are represented in

145
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,900
what we call policy coalition's or

146
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,600
policy networks and the way that trade

147
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:36,159
groups and farm groups and environmental

148
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,560
groups and political interests are

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,130
articulated and come to agree on Agri

150
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,879
environmental policy in the past

151
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,829
conditions what opportunities

152
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,350
for renegotiating agri-environmental

153
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:53,939
policy in the present so history matters

154
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:56,070
I promised you definitions of each of

155
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,769
the terms in the title there you have it

156
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,050
so what does it mean to say I'm excited

157
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:04,019
about a data-driven or an outcome based

158
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,579
approach to Agri Environmental Policy it

159
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,099
immediately means that we don't live in

160
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,959
such a world today I think that Agri

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,710
Environmental Policy is relatively data

162
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,349
poor right now and it's not outcome

163
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,239
based so what's exciting is the idea

164
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,850
that people are going to bring models

165
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,689
about input and output relationships and

166
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,970
how variants in weather slope soil type

167
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:30,569
cropping system nutrient management

168
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,710
planning and practice map on to water

169
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:36,209
quality outcomes as an example

170
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:38,339
traditionally Agra environmental policy

171
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:41,639
has been premise on paying farmers for

172
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:44,279
practices install a buffer strip change

173
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,639
your rotation you split application of

174
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,209
nitrogen those are proxies for outcomes

175
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,159
of interest like improved water quality

176
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:55,699
enhanced biosecurity biodiversity

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,720
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions

178
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,949
but I think there's some problem and

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,630
dissatisfaction from relying on proxies

180
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,500
and I think that taxpayers and

181
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,990
administrators and elected officials

182
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,819
would be increasingly comfortable and

183
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,800
it's attractive to them to be able to

184
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,769
talk about an outcome based approach to

185
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,480
policy evidence-based policy where we

186
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,669
can actually say something and provide

187
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,500
some evidence about the relationship

188
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,259
between inputs which are dollars and

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,410
outcomes which are security well-being

190
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,629
as opposed to relying on how many people

191
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,769
came to your extension meeting how many

192
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:37,080
booklets did you distribute how many

193
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:39,659
farm meeting days did you host those are

194
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,250
all um outputs but they're not outcomes

195
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,379
and so moving to an outcome based

196
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,049
approach is a kind of new grammar of

197
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,480
policy and this is part of this idea of

198
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:51,629
data-driven excitement and bringing

199
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,940
science to bear Agri Environmental

200
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,279
Policy is the portfolio in this country

201
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,440
largely a federally funded conservation

202
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,870
practices I think we could also and I'll

203
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,850
talk

204
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,560
a bit of time allows about private

205
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,350
standards in the role of supermarkets

206
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,179
particularly in advancing and brushing

207
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:11,350
agri-environmental commitments on

208
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:14,528
landscapes critical analysis this is a

209
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,230
social scientific term to explicitly

210
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:20,559
signal that I want to question the

211
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,600
assumptions and the knowledge games that

212
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,299
are embedded in specific ways of framing

213
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,360
problems just because a problem is

214
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:30,370
expressed in a certain way in popular

215
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,259
imaginations or even in scientific

216
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,259
communities it doesn't mean that's the

217
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,389
only way we're best way to express them

218
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:39,338
so we always want to reflexively go back

219
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,100
and ask are we asking the right question

220
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,779
or whose question is being asked and

221
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,210
whose question is being ignored and

222
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:52,450
that's a critical analysis this issue of

223
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,450
institutional change institutions are

224
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,660
the kind of social infrastructure by

225
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,620
which behavior decisions relationships

226
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:04,649
development it's the structure by which

227
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,200
government markets and communities

228
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,629
function by being interested in

229
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,759
institutional change I'm interested in

230
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,580
the shifts in the social relationships

231
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,429
and commitments and ideas that structure

232
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,230
resource allocation and behavior in this

233
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:21,639
case I'm interested in institutional

234
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,220
change associated with

235
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:27,039
agri-environmental policy so can we do

236
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,759
it differently what mediates changes in

237
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,159
how we do the payments of farmers and

238
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:40,240
how we elicit conservation practices on

239
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:41,588
the landscape so a basic and I think

240
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,450
it's it's basically a theory of

241
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:48,360
everything interesting but it might not

242
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,830
hold water I agree with that

243
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,050
but I still want to share it with you as

244
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:57,940
a work-in-progress I'm particularly

245
00:10:53,049 --> 00:11:00,519
interested in this piece in it the idea

246
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,930
is that we're constantly assessing

247
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:09,029
things asking questions about the world

248
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:12,069
we live in and we're taking actions and

249
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,769
those are kind of recursively related to

250
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,500
one another

251
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,289
we take action we reflect on it people

252
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:26,720
reflect on our actions it goes through

253
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:29,360
some cycle of evaluation there's a group

254
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,810
of actors organizations networks or

255
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,909
fields they're developing new

256
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:38,299
capabilities and new competencies to

257
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:41,329
take new actions those actions represent

258
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:43,250
new practices which reconstitute the

259
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,370
organizations and the population of

260
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:51,080
organizations in this case let's say

261
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:53,120
farms or fields that change in farming

262
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,000
practice and farms creates different

263
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,649
outputs economic social and ecological

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,149
and the cycle renews so we evaluate

265
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,809
things we make judgments about

266
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,740
accountability that puts pressure on

267
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,379
organization is like land-grant

268
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,080
universities and farms which create new

269
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:15,769
capabilities for a new round of action

270
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,129
which creates innovation or not which

271
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:21,379
reconfigures the field perhaps to create

272
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:23,539
a new round of outcomes which might be

273
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:28,519
improvement it might be degradation

274
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:30,829
it depends what lens and criteria the

275
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,059
dynamics associated with this theory of

276
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:36,860
everything on the one hand is

277
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:41,059
organizational ecology of you easy

278
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:44,000
changes in fields farms cropping systems

279
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:48,199
is there some selection pressure by

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,350
which we see change in the population of

281
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,440
actors and is there some kind of

282
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,019
accountability or legitimacy test that

283
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,020
creates actionable pressure and

284
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:04,069
selection which changes the character of

285
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:06,529
the field of Agriculture breeds new

286
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,600
competencies let's say to reduce nitrous

287
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,779
oxide emissions or reduce phosphorus

288
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,590
emissions or enhance biodiversity

289
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:17,569
through agricultural practice and how

290
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:25,070
does that change outcomes of interest

291
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:26,180
like greenhouse gas emissions so as a

292
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,399
theory of everything

293
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:31,459
let's not tackle it in this 45 minutes

294
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,740
together I'm really interested of do we

295
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:41,480
have an accountability crisis is that

296
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:44,980
driving something so every policy was

297
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,330
created in a particular context

298
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,190
the agricultural policy that I

299
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,879
recognized in the United States and also

300
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:56,630
in the UK Europe general came out of the

301
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,909
farm crisis of the mid-1980s chronic low

302
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:01,399
commodity prices and we had tremendous

303
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:03,519
shake out in the farm population family

304
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,080
farms are disappearing radically

305
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,049
Congress in this country stepped in in

306
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,000
many different ways one way they sin was

307
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,819
by providing payments to farmers for

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,830
conservation practices those dollars

309
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:20,899
were spent to protect soil protect water

310
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,850
projects but I think equally if not more

311
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,649
importantly those dollars were spent to

312
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,070
protect farmers and rural communities

313
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:31,909
but it's more under farmers incomes and

314
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:37,940
to reduce commodity and to boost

315
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:39,860
commodity prices by reducing supply so

316
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,900
by putting controls on land and taking

317
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,110
land out of production we were able to

318
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,539
reduce supply increased price and put a

319
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,550
floor under farmers incomes all of that

320
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,860
was bundled together under farm

321
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:54,109
legislation and bundled together under

322
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,970
agri-environmental payments so when I

323
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,190
say that every environmental payments

324
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,040
are not cost effective they weren't

325
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,520
designed to be those payments made to

326
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,139
farmers for multifunctional and so when

327
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,909
we say we're not getting as much

328
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,409
environmental benefit per dollar spent

329
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:14,120
the answer is yes it took me by surprise

330
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:20,509
there are 20 years to figure that out

331
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:22,278
but here I am we call them environmental

332
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,009
programs and they are environmental

333
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:28,370
programs but they're not and living with

334
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,799
that paradox it's not easy for me the

335
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,990
principles by which agri-environmental

336
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,479
payments are structured in this country

337
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,820
I'll stick with the u.s. there's a very

338
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,620
strong commitment to volunteers you see

339
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,320
that all the time with you

340
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,899
our algorithms are voluntary we have

341
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,410
cross compliance but by large they're

342
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:53,309
voluntary we rely on standards there's

343
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:55,809
not a tremendous amount of flexibility

344
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:58,779
and there's tremendous solidarity

345
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,889
solidarity among farmers and even more

346
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:05,379
so solidarity between USDA and farmers

347
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:07,360
there's a commitment not to put farmers

348
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,779
in a position of being subject to

349
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,340
discipline the USDA has long taken a

350
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,709
position that they're not willing to

351
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,820
police farmers they want to be a

352
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,850
resource in the agricultural community

353
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:26,680
and be an agent of change and be a

354
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:29,259
booster of Agriculture not and so this

355
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,759
idea that we're gonna flip into

356
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:34,149
something like payment for ecosystem

357
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,189
services and we're gonna use data and

358
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:40,509
we're going to use accountability and

359
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,330
we're going to rely on evidence based

360
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,950
outcome based approaches to deciding if

361
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,710
farmers will get paid and how much they

362
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:51,550
get paid my argument is that all of

363
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,220
those commitments don't fit easily with

364
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:58,659
historical commitments to relying on

365
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,330
standards not outcomes relying on

366
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:06,609
competition no let's rely on solidarity

367
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:08,640
and to rely really on financial

368
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,889
incentives strictly as opposed to

369
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,439
voluntary commitments and so this

370
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,860
historical basis for conservation

371
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,920
doesn't sit with this kind of future

372
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:24,519
vision of relying on the market-based

373
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,539
data-driven and that's the tension the

374
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:31,089
critique of agri-environmental paly as

375
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:33,849
agreeable policy has been poorly focused

376
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,639
that is not a new critique that's a

377
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:37,839
thirty-year-old critique at midnight

378
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,740
when the Conservation Reserve Program

379
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,569
was first created in 1985 the program

380
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,569
basically was organized on first-come

381
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:47,700
first-served

382
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,950
there was no scoring there was no EBI

383
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,480
environmental benefits index was

384
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,909
basically you walked in and said I want

385
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,639
at least the government my crop by crop

386
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,870
land for ten years they said yes they

387
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:59,579
didn't measure environmental benefits

388
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:03,089
they didn't really even look at rental

389
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:04,829
payments over time data administrative

390
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:07,138
techniques have been introduced to

391
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:11,579
ratchet up the amount of data and the

392
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:15,508
kind of rational rational logic but

393
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:21,689
there's more room for increased reliance

394
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:26,480
on data and a more rational competitive

395
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,480
approach to soliciting farmers involved

396
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:32,128
so I suggested that I'm interested in

397
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,918
this idea of accountability crisis or

398
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:39,990
legitimacy driving institutional change

399
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:42,629
in on offer I think three quotes that

400
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,000
highlight the fact that one this is not

401
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:47,878
a new debate and two it's an active

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,849
debate how many of you have heard of the

403
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:56,189
C program the conservation effects

404
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:57,418
assessment program I'm glad replic

405
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,250
you've heard of it it's in your

406
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:05,309
dissertation this is a 15 year old

407
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,159
program out of USDA and it's a massive

408
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:09,619
interagency program to evaluate the

409
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,980
state of the science underlying

410
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:15,689
conservation in animal and I think it's

411
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,048
a very ambitious program on the other

412
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:22,139
hand it's a strictly performative

413
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:26,190
program in that USDA is basically saying

414
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:28,109
don't look to us don't criticize us for

415
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,548
not having the scientific capability to

416
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:33,199
do conservation well and do it

417
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:36,148
efficiently we just spent 15 years doing

418
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,830
data synthesis and coming up with

419
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:43,349
standards and we've got it under control

420
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:46,230
and this concern about the effects and

421
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,959
the effectiveness of conservation arises

422
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,058
from critiques of USDA that come from

423
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,980
outside of the government in critiques

424
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:55,019
from inside the government the

425
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,960
government announcing office reports

426
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,220
that the USDA does not have adequate

427
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,808
processes in place

428
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,140
to optimize environmental performance

429
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:06,808
associated with and that they have very

430
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,140
weak administrative controls on how they

431
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:13,529
spend taxpayer money so it's been an

432
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,320
ongoing if effort to highlight and put

433
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:18,329
pressure on Congress and on USDA and

434
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,839
Natural Resource Conservation Service to

435
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:26,250
up their game and to bring new tools and

436
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,928
new rationality this month there's a new

437
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,630
piece of legislation introduced to

438
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:32,610
Congress called the agricultural data

439
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,890
Act and in the context of the Cornell

440
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:38,029
digital agriculture initiative some

441
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,590
significance but it creates a

442
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,470
possibility and laying great researchers

443
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:47,459
are the specific beneficiaries in the

444
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,980
legislation to get access to field and

445
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,380
farm level records of conservation and

446
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,029
agronomic practice and this would be

447
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,350
revolutionary any of you have tried to

448
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:59,129
get access to farm management data it's

449
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:01,469
not easy

450
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:05,100
whether you go through Hoya or you end

451
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:08,429
up doing individual surveys whether we

452
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:10,980
view this as an opening of the door to

453
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,900
have more data and more access to data I

454
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,940
think you could read it the other way if

455
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,980
you read this quite carefully what's

456
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,169
actually being talked about is the

457
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,630
competitiveness and the economic

458
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:25,470
performance of farm they do mention soil

459
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,570
health but you don't see here a

460
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,279
commitment to opening up for example all

461
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:31,859
of the data that we relevant to analyze

462
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,529
water quality bustard my point is simply

463
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:37,609
to emphasize that this conversation

464
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:41,009
about data creating data capturing data

465
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:47,308
creating access to data using data is an

466
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:50,609
active conversation so the critique of

467
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:52,019
USDA the critique of agriculture broadly

468
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:56,339
defined in terms of environmental

469
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:58,500
performance is an old story I think

470
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,808
there's lots of reasons to think that

471
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,269
agriculture is coming under increasing

472
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:06,029
scrutiny and that there's increasing

473
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,349
pressure on Congress on USDA and on

474
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:12,500
farmers

475
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:12,500
invest differently in conservation

476
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,490
persistent environmental problems

477
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:20,389
whether it's greenhouse gas emissions

478
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:23,250
and nitrous oxide whether it's golf

479
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,860
wetland loss soil erosion they all

480
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,750
continue to be significant animals we

481
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:32,459
can argue about how effectively they've

482
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,859
been abated but they certainly have new

483
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,058
modeling capability we have new sensing

484
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:41,308
capability we have no capacity to huge

485
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:44,129
warehouse synthesize data computer

486
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:46,470
science I think there's a general

487
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,360
appetite for moving to outcome based and

488
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,490
evidence-based policy and I think

489
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,459
there's a general appetite for exposing

490
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,490
actors inside of bureaucracy and in this

491
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,590
case farmers to new discipline the tools

492
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,140
in the of what's called new Public

493
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:04,619
Management or neoliberalism all of those

494
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,440
ideas using object using a kind of value

495
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,538
for money test all seems to have kind of

496
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,080
currency in a contemporary environment

497
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:15,720
and I think the time is ripe to bring

498
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,609
more data and more accountability to

499
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,769
bear on farmers with respect to Agri

500
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:22,109
environmental policy and also similarly

501
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:25,440
not just farmers but also the way USDA

502
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:27,689
spends that money so my argument is and

503
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,340
I think there is pressure on this

504
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,190
remember I showed you that theory of

505
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,959
everything and the arrow to the top

506
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,779
right showed this legitimacy and

507
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,269
accountability push that puts pressure

508
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,668
to start the cycle towards new

509
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,408
competencies and changes in practices

510
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:46,380
and innovation that leads to different

511
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:51,900
socio ecological outcomes but I put this

512
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:54,179
with a question mark because a Greco

513
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,000
chur Agri environmental policy has been

514
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:04,409
in crisis for 30 years there's not a new

515
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,740
crisis the opportunity I said the

516
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,340
glasses have the opportunity here is to

517
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,529
model on a site-specific basis inputs

518
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:16,199
and outputs to understand the

519
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,798
relationship between farming practices

520
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,929
local environmental conditions and

521
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,108
conservation

522
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:27,210
interventions and how those yield

523
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:30,358
benefits and of course healed costs and

524
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,119
by using data and striving to pay for

525
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:35,308
results to maximize conservation

526
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:37,099
benefits under budget constraint we

527
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:40,079
could make taxpayer dollars go further

528
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:43,888
we could enhance the environment and in

529
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:47,249
theory not create dips in farm income or

530
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:49,798
spikes in fringe cost of food whether we

531
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:52,618
can achieve that win-win it's important

532
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,808
nonetheless we could make an analysis

533
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:56,459
that would allow us to intervene in

534
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:59,398
conservation in a way that's more

535
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,600
surgical and precise that's the

536
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:06,358
opportunity the constraints the reason

537
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,608
that we haven't picked up these $10

538
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:10,618
bills off the floor the reasons that we

539
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,230
already haven't harnessed the power of

540
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:15,589
data and models to drive conservation

541
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:19,409
and achieve something like precision

542
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:21,499
conservation I want to argue we can make

543
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:24,239
sense of through three bullet points

544
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:26,759
specification problems estimation

545
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:32,730
problems and the historical problem of

546
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:34,710
political economic relations when we

547
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:38,878
think about the specification problems

548
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:41,999
it becomes clear that agriculture is a

549
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:44,548
big industry very heterogeneous

550
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,470
conditions and lots of different kinds

551
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:48,058
of problem so if we said we're going to

552
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,249
increase the cost-effectiveness of

553
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,230
conservation you would say well what do

554
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:57,868
you mean oh you mean surface water or

555
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,528
groundwater you mean wetlands or do you

556
00:25:57,868 --> 00:26:01,138
mean

557
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,509
greenhouse gases do you mean soil

558
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:05,459
erosion or do you mean farmworkers

559
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:07,679
health there's lots of different things

560
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,269
that can be optimized and lots of

561
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,538
different things that we could invest in

562
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:15,028
and so this problem of specification is

563
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:18,028
quite messy how do you make commensurate

564
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:20,638
and comparable these different types of

565
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:22,528
social priorities and aspirations and

566
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:23,849
the answer is you don't really do it

567
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:26,460
economists might say that they have

568
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:28,199
techniques or philosophers I say they

569
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,239
have techniques but it's pretty messy

570
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,149
business when you try to get people to

571
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:34,360
agree on what are the benefits change

572
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:38,219
you're most interested

573
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:42,778
and how would you value those lemons

574
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:46,990
would a conservation benefit in suburban

575
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:48,940
New York 40 miles from New York City the

576
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,009
value of that conservation because of

577
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,528
the density of the population would make

578
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,490
conservation in South Dakota impossible

579
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:58,778
if you did it on a dollar basis

580
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,759
there's the willingness to pay of those

581
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:03,398
consumers and the number of consumers is

582
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:05,798
so high you tried to rationalize that

583
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:08,168
spending on some economic calculation

584
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:10,240
you'd be stuck with a very messy problem

585
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,940
all of the spending would be in urban

586
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,308
metropolitan areas and deep rural areas

587
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,480
would get nothing and so this idea of

588
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:21,700
using data using economics to specify

589
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,889
where to invest in how to invest is not

590
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,929
straightforward and it opens up lots of

591
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:31,199
ethical philosophical legal and

592
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:33,909
political questions estimation

593
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,340
estimating costs and benefits of

594
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:40,200
conservation is non-trivial I assume

595
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:44,230
many of you are doing this for a living

596
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,639
at it it's non-trivial the models the

597
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,889
scale of those models the data

598
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:51,009
requirements of those models make it

599
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:53,439
tough the costs of those models are the

600
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:56,019
transaction costs of moving to a data

601
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,610
rich environment are non-trivial the

602
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,919
more data we have to collect the more

603
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:02,379
data we have to make sense of all of

604
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,389
that costs and what are the benefits

605
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:10,028
well it depends and we can argue not

606
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:12,548
only do you have to estimate the

607
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:14,169
benefits of a conservation practice but

608
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:16,808
in order to do that you have to have a

609
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:19,419
baseline for a counterfactual scenario

610
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:21,579
against which to compare it so in theory

611
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,740
you'd have to collect data before you

612
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:25,359
make a conservation intervention then

613
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,220
you have to collect data after you make

614
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,288
the conservation intervention then you

615
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,240
have to parameterize the weather then

616
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:33,490
particularly happen during that growing

617
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,888
season or that week and make sense of

618
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,380
that all of that is costly and difficult

619
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:40,839
and we're not there yet so the

620
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,850
challenges of estimating economic and

621
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,349
ecological performance of conservation

622
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,428
in site-specific environments are

623
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,009
non-trivial

624
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,370
and this very much impedes this kind of

625
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:51,430
move

626
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:53,969
this flip of institutional change into a

627
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:58,029
data rich outcome-based

628
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,759
and the last one of political economy

629
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:04,058
all of you think in high school at least

630
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:06,129
if you're when us high schools or

631
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:09,039
familiar with the Iron Triangle where

632
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:12,690
interest groups develop relationships

633
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,789
with bureaucrats which lead to a

634
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,860
regulatory failure institutional failure

635
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:21,819
we basically have a situation in which

636
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:24,879
Congress is not interested in imposing

637
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:26,409
greater discipline on us ta they're not

638
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,630
interested in imposing greater

639
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,690
discipline on farmers and I think we

640
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,300
could say the same thing for USDA they

641
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,400
do not want to be the policemen of

642
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:39,069
Agriculture and it's not going to help

643
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,730
them with their mission not politically

644
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:44,859
their organizational culture is kind of

645
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,390
boots on the ground they don't

646
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:48,189
necessarily want to be in the basement

647
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,340
with models crunching numbers

648
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,019
it'd rather be having conversations with

649
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:55,240
farmers and trying to build

650
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:58,869
relationships that yield positive

651
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,500
outcomes for agriculture and so I think

652
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:07,509
the most important thing is that there

653
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:10,029
is a great ambivalence about imposing

654
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:12,549
discipline on farmers that's not how we

655
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,710
come to this point and now if you

656
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:17,799
imagine we're going to use data use

657
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,579
economics use models use satellites use

658
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,139
drones to figure out how conservation

659
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:25,480
should be organized they're going to

660
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:34,020
impose that knowledge on the landscape

661
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:37,329
through farmers it's a tough sell so the

662
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:41,349
opportunity is to use science new

663
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:42,909
politics and new thinking to make more

664
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:46,419
cost-effective approaches to

665
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:51,130
conservation it constraints our

666
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:53,590
specification estimation and now it

667
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,800
doesn't mean that we're stuck although I

668
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:58,329
think maybe it doesn't mean we're stuck

669
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:00,220
but I think that there are possibilities

670
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,619
I'm going to close in a minute I want to

671
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,850
hear

672
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:06,349
you where you think this could go I

673
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:09,139
think the smart money's on more of the

674
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:12,709
same that's where the smart money is

675
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,960
we're locked into this relationship and

676
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:18,590
I think it's important to recognize you

677
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,130
know that the u.s. farm bill we bundle

678
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:21,759
together

679
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:25,430
agricultural policy and food assistance

680
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:28,579
over 80% of spending in the farm bill is

681
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:32,029
food assistance and this means that

682
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:34,699
urban states are invested in the farm

683
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:36,379
bill not just rural states and this is a

684
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,620
kind of mutual non-aggression treaty

685
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:42,380
between Iowa and New York Iowa and

686
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:43,939
Massachusetts that we're not going to

687
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,250
spit on your shoes and you're not going

688
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,679
to spit on my shoes and this is a very

689
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,630
clever way to do agricultural policy in

690
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,780
a big and diverse country when it comes

691
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:57,520
to saying let's ratchet up the data on

692
00:31:53,779 --> 00:32:01,329
farmers and let's get some conservation

693
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,009
people are particularly interested I

694
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:06,710
think more of the same is in the cards I

695
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:09,529
think you know the cost of sensors is

696
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:12,319
dropping radically it's amazing what's

697
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:14,389
happening with sensors the potential to

698
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,210
use secondary data and aerial

699
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,490
photographs and satellites and drones so

700
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,130
these other ways to do sensing both in

701
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,319
field in plant tissue but also remotely

702
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,090
creates all types of new opportunities

703
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,909
it can drive down the costs of data

704
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:31,369
collection revolutions in artificial

705
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,500
intelligence data synthesis in

706
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:35,178
architecture of computing creates all

707
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,730
types of opportunities to do useful

708
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:40,280
things with that data maybe we're going

709
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,160
to have a data revolution don't hold

710
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,289
your breath

711
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,580
private standards just because Congress

712
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:51,589
won't act doesn't mean Walmart won't act

713
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:53,359
the private standards over the last 20

714
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:54,859
years to become very very important in

715
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,199
agriculture and not just in the United

716
00:32:54,859 --> 00:33:01,308
States but around the world large

717
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,750
powerful retailers are promoting in some

718
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:09,279
case dictating concert farming practices

719
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:12,049
pesticide use selection of varieties

720
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,250
irrigation scheduling in a variety of

721
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:16,700
ways

722
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:19,130
it's possible that value chains and

723
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:22,279
relationships farmers have with retail

724
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:24,860
or food processors could lead to a more

725
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,420
data rich a more rational and a more

726
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:28,339
accountable and a more kind of

727
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,039
disciplinary environment in which

728
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:33,679
conservation is practiced it's possible

729
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,779
and I think this idea of payment for

730
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,070
ecosystem services how many here heard

731
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:42,889
of p/es payment this idea of using this

732
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:46,009
logic would fit quite neatly under a

733
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:49,670
private scheme of organizing production

734
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:53,869
with farmers and incentivizing them to

735
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:57,470
engage in conservation I think that the

736
00:33:53,869 --> 00:34:00,500
political coalition's that gave rise in

737
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,360
the 1980s could be reconfigured and

738
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,119
recreated it happened once it could

739
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:07,250
happen again I think we should not be so

740
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,409
myopic to think that we only lived

741
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,539
through the only history histories being

742
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,059
created every day and there could be new

743
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:18,019
history I have been waiting for 30 years

744
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:19,099
I'm still waiting it's possible that you

745
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:22,550
know we're gonna reach some type of

746
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:24,679
nitrogen cascade Greenland ice shelf

747
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,110
melting that will flip us into a new

748
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,230
reality with the new politics that's not

749
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:32,329
a particularly rosy future but it is

750
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,119
possible if we want to see how could a

751
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:39,199
gree environmental change agreement it

752
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,359
has a more I've written that it might

753
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,609
interest in the idea that farmers come

754
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,880
clean and say yes it's a dirty industry

755
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:50,390
but we are gonna take ownership of that

756
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,400
and we want regulatory forgiveness and

757
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,159
we want money and we want the support of

758
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,269
the land-grant universities to farm

759
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,460
differently so instead of denying the

760
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:03,739
problems of environment own them which

761
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,320
would be a complete flip from from our

762
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:08,869
Bureau Federation and commodity groups

763
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,850
currently function there's variety out

764
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,400
there but by and large I don't think

765
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:16,480
agriculture production agriculture has

766
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,950
been particularly engaged and

767
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,740
progressive when it comes to ecology

768
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:24,149
they mostly have been denying and

769
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:26,969
shunting off blamed urban populations

770
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:33,240
so all of these are possibilities that

771
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:35,039
could shake up this kind of stickiness

772
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,959
that we confront ourself that we find

773
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,210
ourselves on the one hand new

774
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,159
capabilities and data being created and

775
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,349
they're finding their way in unevenly

776
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,819
into policy on the other hand there's

777
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:48,539
lots of reasons we don't see a data

778
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,620
revolution so coming to a close as we

779
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:55,050
reflect on institutional change

780
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:57,359
everything is it possible that crisis of

781
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,940
legitimacy and accountability can create

782
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,030
a dynamic of progress of learning of

783
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,070
enriching administration and practice

784
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:10,980
through bringing data to bear I don't

785
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:12,360
know despite the fact that the number of

786
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,449
farms the percentage of the population

787
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,450
engaged culture drops the economics

788
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:22,889
increasingly in urban society for all

789
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:26,090
these reasons people have said that

790
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:29,759
Agriculture's political power will wane

791
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:32,070
it hasn't happened yet agriculture still

792
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,500
remains a very potent political block

793
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,830
for historical cognitive and cultural

794
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,360
reasons I think it's interesting to

795
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:43,019
think about can the Government

796
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,510
Accounting Office put a candle under

797
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:49,230
Congress and under USDA can the state

798
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:52,530
fix itself or is it civil society social

799
00:36:49,230 --> 00:37:04,139
movements and science that could somehow

800
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:07,050
catalyze a change and we look at

801
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:11,509
critiques of knowledge systems science

802
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:15,660
data are implicated in Agriculture USDA

803
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:18,350
like all bureaucracies and agriculture

804
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:21,149
like all sectors are very adept at

805
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:24,869
collecting criticism and deflecting

806
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,099
criticism the USDA took this critique of

807
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,199
the knowledge base underlying

808
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,259
conservation and turned it into a

809
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,299
victory party a celebration of how much

810
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,099
they knew and how forward-looking they

811
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,630
are that's a glass-half-full perspective

812
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:43,969
in some ways these sectors are so

813
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,429
politically entrenched that they are

814
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:48,769
somehow bulletproof but of course

815
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:55,869
they're not change does happen but it's

816
00:37:48,768 --> 00:38:01,359
slow with that I close

817
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,359
[Applause]

818
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:11,029
legitimacy in credibility synonymous

819
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:21,720
legitimacy and credibility I think yes

820
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:24,239
and no I think legitimacy generally we

821
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:27,599
talk about legitimacy as conformance

822
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:31,669
with sets of norms and practices that

823
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:36,599
are commensurate or compatible with

824
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:40,289
cognitive and legal standards and so

825
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:44,849
it's a kind of conformance problem so is

826
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:49,110
the practice is the behavior map on to

827
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:53,099
some standard credibility I guess is

828
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:55,460
more about accuracy or validity which

829
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,349
might be subject to a more technical

830
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,869
assessment so legitimacy is not really

831
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:02,699
subject to a technical assessment does

832
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:05,699
it kind of feel right does it resonate

833
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:08,250
with you as being kosher

834
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:12,089
that would be a kind of qualitative

835
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:14,190
assessment of credibility I don't know I

836
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:18,390
guess I'm thinking a more technocratic

837
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:21,170
approach to evaluating credibility how

838
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,170
do you think about them

839
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:35,089
well the legitimacy you know you know

840
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:37,829
fitting into existing structures I

841
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:40,470
haven't really thought well that does

842
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:42,929
sound right credibility is just can you

843
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:55,559
you know you know do you believe the

844
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:58,949
results of the study yeah I think my

845
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,139
point is that if the credibility of USTA

846
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:03,449
the credibility of conservation practice

847
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,549
the credibility of conservation science

848
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:07,379
if all of that stuff is brought into

849
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,690
question and it will have lost its

850
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,349
legitimacy legitimacy will be tarnished

851
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:15,659
which creates an opening for something

852
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:18,839
new not necessarily something better but

853
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:20,699
something different so credibility why I

854
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,329
think would be an important element of

855
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:23,329
legitimacy

856
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:36,179
I was wondering or watching history we

857
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,820
have a unique opportunity now to make

858
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:42,239
history here at an academic institution

859
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:45,120
yeah I'm aware about the the credibility

860
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,529
lost or the interview by a large

861
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,659
proportion of this country society

862
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:54,900
towards academia but but still we which

863
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:57,179
stood a little bit outside of a lot of

864
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,130
the structure we can play and we can

865
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:04,919
demonstrate them you mentioned

866
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:07,440
data-driven evidence and and the the

867
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,079
revolution in in sensing technology

868
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,500
these days if we could just show what

869
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,449
what there is what is possible I would

870
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,019
think that there ought to catch on to

871
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:21,439
turn the time

872
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:24,050
I'm also a little bit worried about the

873
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,210
double standards that there are some

874
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,769
environmental externalities that I'm a

875
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,550
little bit more familiar with such as

876
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:33,989
carbon trading or payments for carbon

877
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,240
sequestration Breanna solution

878
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:40,319
reductions where whether there is

879
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:44,399
already the absolute need for data you

880
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:47,420
have to really show that you can you

881
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,210
sequester carbon or reduce emissions and

882
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:53,690
in the landscape that is also a metered

883
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,659
through remote sensing or in field

884
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,340
measurements sometimes who practices but

885
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:02,909
more often through evidence of actual

886
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,610
reductions or sequestration so why not

887
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:08,759
disagreement why do they think they can

888
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:11,550
live outside our society in just saying

889
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,450
okay I do it give me 200 bucks per per

890
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,190
acre and never check it never check that

891
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,679
actually a cheese pudding supposed to

892
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,010
achieve that doesn't work in any other

893
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:27,829
sector yeah so good thank you

894
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:29,580
the first one I think the idea that

895
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:34,170
scientists in the scientific community

896
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:37,199
can create new tools and provide

897
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:40,050
evidence which then is taken up through

898
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:44,609
some magical process by legislators and

899
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:48,240
by practitioners as some validity it's

900
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:50,010
it's there's some reason to believe that

901
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,649
there's a kind of linear process by

902
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,930
which good ideas and proven technologies

903
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,840
find their way even if there is a

904
00:42:54,929 --> 00:43:01,230
political fence or there's ignorance or

905
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:04,170
there's bias so history shows that good

906
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,449
ideas can find their way but in general

907
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,579
I think we see lots of situations where

908
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:11,069
political and economic constraints

909
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,289
require that we don't rely on this kind

910
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,750
of passive approach and that we have to

911
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:18,659
be in the fray and so Cornell's engaged

912
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,210
initiative is very much about saying we

913
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:23,069
need to do research in a way that is in

914
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,289
relation with communities and

915
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,750
practitioners in the general public and

916
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:30,000
not rely on this passive approach to

917
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,099
will do the science will burp up good

918
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,849
ideas and they'll find their way out

919
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:39,348
there into

920
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:45,960
practice to be more strategic and I

921
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:48,660
mention companies that's what I I agree

922
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,329
and we do enjoy great privilege to be

923
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:55,199
isolated from a lot of pressures and

924
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:57,329
monitoring you know this whole analysis

925
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,848
could be used for citation evaluations

926
00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:02,099
for your productivity and your impact

927
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:04,019
assessment reports right that we're all

928
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,450
on the verge of being subject to

929
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:07,738
discipline and data so don't wish it on

930
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:11,879
the farmers if you don't wish it on

931
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:15,929
yourself the second point that I think

932
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,019
that well the the third point is I think

933
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:22,879
it is remarkable that farmers enjoy such

934
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:27,058
a regulatory vacuum and forgiveness

935
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,130
largely unregulated we could say Capo's

936
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,528
are regulated the Clean Water Act

937
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,210
pesticide labeling yeah yeah yeah

938
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:41,130
agriculture has got it good and they

939
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:44,099
know it yes so Rick and I have a paper

940
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,789
the revisions were due yesterday I have

941
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:47,160
to get busy

942
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:50,640
I want to share this with you because

943
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:53,879
our paper shows that the science and the

944
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,670
rigor associated with creating measures

945
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,170
of additionality real value created so

946
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:01,289
some difference according to a baseline

947
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,999
are constructed in a way that resembles

948
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:08,190
sausage-making you know that joke about

949
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:13,468
policymaking and so I would say all of

950
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:16,559
these approaches to measurement involve

951
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:19,979
on the one hand rigor and empiricism and

952
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,289
the other hand swamp and I wouldn't want

953
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:25,228
to characterize some of them as the gold

954
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:27,930
standard and bulletproof and that

955
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:30,588
science and this is just folk wisdom and

956
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:33,298
they're making it up I think we can find

957
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:36,210
validity and credibility in folk

958
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:38,699
practice and and grounded practice and

959
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:41,818
we can find nonsense in what is called

960
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:45,149
science I'll send you this paper and

961
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:48,119
it's on nitrous nitrous oxide and

962
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:50,278
cars nitrous-oxide protocol for doing

963
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,079
offset payments in corn production based

964
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:59,998
on the kellogg biological field stations

965
00:45:52,079 --> 00:46:05,579
data other questions comments thanks

966
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:07,439
so here constraints to do big progress I

967
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,930
broke them down into two categories

968
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,970
first was to state problem is hard and

969
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:14,998
the second is to say we don't have the

970
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:18,088
will to address the problem and if you

971
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:21,078
agree with that categorization but he

972
00:46:18,088 --> 00:46:23,849
needed that second word is

973
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,769
hierarchically more important than the

974
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:27,390
first part in other words if we had the

975
00:46:25,768 --> 00:46:29,598
will to address the problem and maybe

976
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:32,190
Cornell does have a well with the

977
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,539
initiative for data and agriculture to

978
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:40,230
address the problems but you know us ei

979
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:43,440
to government in general maybe not

980
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:46,920
terribly international allergies or into

981
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,489
rewarding friends and I a logical allies

982
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,950
so what are you doing

983
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:55,619
yes you're asking the right questions

984
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:58,018
and I do think that if we had political

985
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,759
commitments that the technical problems

986
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:03,268
but they wouldn't take care of

987
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:04,739
themselves but those are are we doing

988
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:06,118
the right things versus doing things

989
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,670
right so first are we doing the right

990
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:13,230
things and that's a political and a

991
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,880
cultural problem I think that and I have

992
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:18,449
deeply ambivalent about this whole

993
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,980
future putting the the screws to farmers

994
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:22,018
equipping the Natural Resource

995
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:26,159
Conservation Service with comprehensive

996
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:28,528
data from remote sensing platforms and

997
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,449
integrative tools to know what everyone

998
00:47:28,528 --> 00:47:32,608
had for breakfast and so forth that's

999
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:35,009
not a particularly rosy future so we can

1000
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:36,690
find ourselves in a very dark place with

1001
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:41,009
these kind of data rich futures you've

1002
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,599
all seen black mirror so I think that we

1003
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:44,099
don't want to go overboard and we need

1004
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,380
to keep in mind that if we're all

1005
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:49,349
excited or not if I'm excited about

1006
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:52,140
bringing data to bear to create value

1007
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:53,880
for taxpayers and introduce discipline

1008
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:57,719
to the way we pay farmers to do

1009
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,930
conservation yes but I think we have to

1010
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,719
have some caution

1011
00:47:58,929 --> 00:48:05,649
some respect and some modesty about

1012
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:07,719
where this could take us so I agree we

1013
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,730
have a political problem but the

1014
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:12,278
solution I think is not to go around and

1015
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,679
say you guys are our troglodytes and

1016
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:17,079
you're not using data and data rules and

1017
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,578
we're all gonna be technic rats right I

1018
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,900
think that's a kind of we were I assume

1019
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:21,818
you wouldn't want to go there either

1020
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,599
right so I think it's kind of a delicate

1021
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:27,278
a delicate issue I what else is but I

1022
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,460
would say the first one specification is

1023
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:32,139
not a hard problem it's a wicked problem

1024
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,150
this question of do we value wetlands

1025
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:36,308
more than greenhouse gas is more than

1026
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:39,818
groundwater more than phosphorus for the

1027
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:42,250
nitrogen and how would we sort that out

1028
00:48:39,818 --> 00:48:44,739
except through a political process I

1029
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,199
don't think it's a technical it's not a

1030
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:50,919
hard problem it's a values problem so it

1031
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:52,778
is hard but it's not technical I was

1032
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,519
thinking you might benefit by looking at

1033
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:55,929
other countries I've lived the

1034
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:57,969
Netherlands most of the time and that's

1035
00:48:55,929 --> 00:49:01,328
got much longer history of using science

1036
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:04,058
directly in policy and has led to

1037
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:06,630
regulation and a confrontational

1038
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:09,548
approach where the farmers typically say

1039
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,588
there are many examples they use nitrate

1040
00:49:09,548 --> 00:49:13,838
models specifically regulate amounts of

1041
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:15,969
newer there's phosphate regulations

1042
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,769
recently very strongly strengthened and

1043
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:19,528
water quality it's very different

1044
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:21,759
society but I was just thinking unique

1045
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:23,170
compare different countries and then how

1046
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,569
the Institute because you're interested

1047
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:27,068
in how the institutions the different

1048
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:28,480
ministries for example in that case have

1049
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:31,150
changed that would be an interesting

1050
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,940
comparison thank you I'm very much

1051
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:37,329
interested in comparative across sectors

1052
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:39,429
and across countries in how institutions

1053
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:46,930
are configured and how they change I do

1054
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:48,399
think that is not totally absolved of

1055
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:53,348
these problems I think that there's

1056
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:56,139
still a lot of corporatism consensus

1057
00:49:53,349 --> 00:50:00,068
base not just science-based yes very

1058
00:49:56,139 --> 00:50:06,250
much agreement but I would say the

1059
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:06,579
politics are the happiest country in the

1060
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,710
world

1061
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:10,750
yeah right so and they also have a

1062
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,159
really clean politics and they have a

1063
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:16,539
really rich

1064
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:20,108
and educated citizenry and they in there

1065
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:23,260
forest management same problems we have

1066
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:25,630
by and large very high trust in public

1067
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,450
institutions very well-educated people

1068
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,309
plenty of money for the state and they

1069
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,980
still suffer from some of these same

1070
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:43,030
things I talked about so it's always

1071
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:46,030
better in Europe this has been a

1072
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:50,280
production of Cornell University on the

1073
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,280
web at Cornell edu
