1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,389
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:10,740
University one of the wonderful things

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:16,289
about working at Cornell University is

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:19,109
the people you get to work with and I've

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,750
had a number of outstanding graduate

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,050
students and one of them is dr. Chris

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,379
Peters and it's his work that I'm going

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,279
to be presenting I've you know I helped

9
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:35,369
him but with the approach that we've

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,500
taken in this work is a modeling study

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,320
or a whole series of modeling studies

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,499
the work started at Cornell University

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,320
and was funded by USDA and later the

14
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:48,329
Kellogg Foundation and looking over a

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,609
whole series of studies what we wanted

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,939
to do was determine how many persons

17
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,999
could be fed a complete balanced diet on

18
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,789
land currently in use to grow food crops

19
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:02,969
with sustainable methods this would be

20
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:07,099
in the United States and how much land

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:11,519
is needed to feed one person the

22
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:14,369
research and modeling team involved dr.

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,709
Chris Peters who's not Tufts University

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,109
in the school of nutrition science and

25
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,689
policy and a number of his graduate

26
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,239
students have contributed to the latter

27
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,310
part of this dr. Jennifer Wilkins was

28
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,799
formerly at Cornell in food science I

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,840
now think she's in an endowed chair but

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,899
in any case he's at public health and

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,870
food studies and nutrition at Syracuse

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,300
University dr. art limbo is now Seles

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,490
berry University in the science and

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,450
technology department he helped us with

35
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:48,359
a lot of the interface with mapping and

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,719
so forth dr. Nelson's bills was in am is

37
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,120
retired and and I'm now retired so we

38
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,700
kind of moved away from from Cornell

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,189
University the background on the first

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,530
just noticed that that Chris Peters is

41
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,299
the senior author and all the papers I

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,989
put up here this is not the complete

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,929
list but the other thing they started

44
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,030
publication in 2007 and out of this

45
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,979
funding grant request the last paper

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:19,199
came out

47
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:22,139
half ago the studies I'm going to look

48
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,699
at today are first of all looking at the

49
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:29,279
New York State model where we looked at

50
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,959
the diet what we called food prints and

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,539
food sheds well define those a little

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,580
bit later and the population that could

53
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,009
be fed in New York State with our

54
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,670
agricultural land so what that study was

55
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,739
funded by USDA Kellogg Foundation became

56
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:48,030
interested in the work we were doing and

57
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:50,370
then put us funded us to compare New

58
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,489
York State with Michigan New Mexico and

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,090
Mississippi and then to look at all 48

60
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,250
states they picked out these four

61
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,069
additional or three additional States

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,889
because Kellogg Foundation is interested

63
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:07,708
in childhood nutrition or malnutrition

64
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:11,279
and Michigan and major studies going on

65
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:14,219
in Detroit for inner-city kids in New

66
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,919
Mexico on the Indian reservations and in

67
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,099
Mississippi rural poor and they said

68
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,539
we'll give you money to study all 48

69
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,250
adjacent states if you do these three

70
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,199
next and there's some interesting

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,568
studies there and then we went on to

72
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,849
look at all 48 states to compare

73
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:33,738
balanced diets relative to the

74
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:37,620
populations that that could be supported

75
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:41,359
how much food does it take the

76
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,430
information for most of this work is in

77
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,700
published sources and with a lot of

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,980
calculation and if you wait the average

79
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,259
size of an American all sizes of people

80
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,509
all ages all genders all physiological

81
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:58,649
states according to the distribution it

82
00:03:54,509 --> 00:04:02,219
takes 2153 calories or kilocalories per

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,000
person to balance the diet and what kind

84
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:09,598
of diet we actually went back to the

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,449
1992 USDA food pyramid my plate looks a

86
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,729
whole lot different but it doesn't show

87
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,279
you this important information of how

88
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,719
many servings you are and you can get

89
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,298
into the footnotes it tells you how many

90
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,669
cups of various kinds of food or what

91
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,659
weight of food so we actually could

92
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:28,089
start here and work

93
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,760
to agricultural production with the

94
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:36,669
information provided in the pyramid what

95
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,620
we put into the models finally the last

96
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,860
one is a hundred and eighty six primary

97
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,990
food commodities those are essentially

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,139
crops in the USDA database about crop

99
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,730
production in the United States there

100
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,159
are a lot more foods than that but those

101
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,430
are the primary commodities and what is

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,070
it

103
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,379
corn shows up in 30 percent of the food

104
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,060
in the supermarket right now so there's

105
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,610
there's some assumptions and

106
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,790
manipulations going on here but we're

107
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,860
going back from these food commodities

108
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,100
to agricultural commodities or actually

109
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,770
crop production and then the USDA and

110
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,700
and other services have also told us

111
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:22,229
what's a loss from the time it gets out

112
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,939
of the field through storage processing

113
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,620
cooking all of this what is the total

114
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,839
loss and again it's information

115
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,819
available for each one of those kinds of

116
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,829
foods and you end up then with the

117
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,599
weight of food that's consumed and the

118
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:37,109
interesting thing about this study

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,350
particularly when we started back in

120
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,150
just after 2000 is we're linking

121
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:46,680
agriculture and crop production to human

122
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:49,659
nutrition and a pretty sophisticated way

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,379
using the data that is out there so that

124
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,210
that was was a cool thing and I have not

125
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,550
listed the crops but they're categorized

126
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,799
all the grains all the vegetables the

127
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,650
fruits the dairy products other protein

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,530
crops beans lentils and so forth added

129
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:08,949
fats and sweeteners are the categories

130
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,559
in the diet and one of the statements

131
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,379
that Chris made in the last paper I

132
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,930
showed up there is that land I almost

133
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,529
wanted to say soil is the foundational

134
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,120
resource um it's not the only one you

135
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,869
could argue that water is going to be a

136
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,189
limiting factor or that climate is

137
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,680
becoming a limiting factor but we

138
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,060
focused on the land factor in these

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,870
studies

140
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:38,290
and how do you define sustainable land

141
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,180
use and this you know I didn't come up

142
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,980
with this except when we were in our

143
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,069
earlier discussions I said let's go back

144
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:49,660
to the land use capability classes from

145
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:51,849
from NRCS and this is how we'll be fine

146
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,450
lot of sustainable use there are eight

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,150
classes of land class one land has only

148
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,990
slight limitations to crop production

149
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:03,579
class two land has only moderate

150
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,470
limitations class three they say they're

151
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:09,430
severe and what's happening as you go

152
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:13,270
down here to one through through skip

153
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,990
five one through four and then six and

154
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,629
seven

155
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,740
generally the slope is increasing so the

156
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:23,350
land becomes more erosive but there

157
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,410
could be other limitations so anyway you

158
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,050
get out here class five has a set of

159
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,470
limitations that are not easily

160
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:35,470
corrected it's too shallow too rocky too

161
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,740
wet too steep the growing seasons to

162
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,300
cope as an aside I was crossing when I

163
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,519
was a graduate student traveling from

164
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,780
Nebraska to Davis in California I

165
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,219
stopped the gas up in the Great Basin

166
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,829
mountains all around with lots of snow

167
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,690
and I said why is this in sagebrush why

168
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,089
isn't an irritant in irrigated

169
00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:00,009
agriculture and the guy said we get a

170
00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:02,199
frost 12 months of the year beautiful

171
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,810
looking land plenty of water around for

172
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,060
irrigation but it's going to be in class

173
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,439
five you can't grow crops there anyway

174
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,290
you get down here what are the

175
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,219
management modifications on this well if

176
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,090
you get to class

177
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,479
to land and you use conservation tillage

178
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:25,209
you can crop it every year even though

179
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:29,050
it has some slope or you can crop it

180
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:32,110
only three out of five years in a crop

181
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,320
rotation the other two years it needs to

182
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,570
be in a sod crop essentially pasture

183
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,219
something you could raise but it you

184
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,620
don't need need to graze it but it needs

185
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,080
to be an aside to protect and then you

186
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,919
used conservation tillage on class three

187
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,399
land

188
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:52,899
or put Assad on it three out of five

189
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,730
years or you can just use it Assad - out

190
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,798
of the five years with conservation

191
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,459
tillage that's how you're reading my

192
00:08:56,798 --> 00:09:02,528
code up there you get to class for land

193
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:06,998
you only can crop it once and every five

194
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:09,308
years and so forth you get down here

195
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:11,678
class six lands only grazing and so

196
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:13,928
forth the model data we started out in

197
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:15,578
New York and I'll just show you this

198
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,519
rather than going through those details

199
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:20,588
this is a map of land using in New York

200
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,749
State we're really interested in the

201
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,730
agricultural use of the land and it

202
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:26,918
pulls out like this New York State looks

203
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,199
kind of funny here the border the state

204
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:31,328
is actually down here and they've

205
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:33,428
extended the border to the American

206
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:36,219
border next to counted out into the

207
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:38,168
lakes but anyhow that's where the

208
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,559
agricultural land is in New York State

209
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:44,168
here's western New York where there is a

210
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:47,198
concentration of that land so we plugged

211
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:50,168
in the dietary information the land data

212
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:52,269
and we we then did the calculations how

213
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:54,639
many people could you feed and we looked

214
00:09:52,269 --> 00:10:03,610
at different diets the diets we looked

215
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:06,698
at ran from this this many calories well

216
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,909
wait a minute I'm kidding I'm not going

217
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:12,219
backwards there we go

218
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:14,168
we had percent calories from fat that

219
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,119
influences how many people you can feed

220
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:19,328
and over here is the population you can

221
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:21,100
feed with just the agricultural land in

222
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:25,178
use currently in use at its current

223
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,659
night 2010 with different diets with

224
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:31,119
from 2i0 ounces to six ounces of meat

225
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,399
and the diet and the really interesting

226
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:37,298
thing about this the surprise is that

227
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,188
the vegetarian diet no meat as you

228
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:42,249
increase the fat and feed fewer people

229
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:44,708
producing fat takes more land more more

230
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:46,538
energy it's photosynthetically not as

231
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,969
efficient if you get right down to the

232
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:51,609
physiology and actually you look at

233
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,548
these numbers on a vegetarian diet

234
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,528
versus these with two ounces of meat in

235
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:57,949
the diet you can actually feed more

236
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:00,679
people

237
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,990
a little bit of meat using the New York

238
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,689
State land base then you can on a

239
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,090
vegetarian dot that was a surprise to a

240
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,490
lot of ecologist and we had to explain

241
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,009
what was going on there the issue is

242
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,810
that because of the nature of the land

243
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:18,350
in New York State you have all this

244
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:22,459
unused land and when you get back here

245
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,960
to the zero ounces or Rams a different

246
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,180
scale right there didn't get the scale

247
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,800
changing all my slides I'm I'm sorry but

248
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,189
anyway you've got a lot of unused land

249
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,169
so you're feeding fewer people because

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,720
you've got land you cannot use in a

251
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:39,379
sustainable manner it's just too steep

252
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,840
and as you increase the quantity of meat

253
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,710
in the diet use more and more of the

254
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,780
land with those perennial crops raising

255
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:53,930
beef cattle sheep dairy cattle on the

256
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:56,959
steeper Hills and and let's see next

257
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,199
slide so how many people can we feed if

258
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,519
we're looking at this is the 30% calorie

259
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
that's in the middle of the table

260
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,769
not the extremes I was talking about

261
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,860
earlier we can feed almost 30% of the

262
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:15,949
population of New York State in two

263
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:17,690
thousand in a vegetarian diet and this

264
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,490
is in hectares I'll show you an acre is

265
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,490
a little bit that later on but you see

266
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,720
this is the unused land so the land that

267
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:37,009
you're using decreases as as you go from

268
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:39,560
six ounces of meat six ounces it is a

269
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,230
lot so here is the summary and the

270
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,729
extension publication

271
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,700
thank you for crediting me with some

272
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,350
extension work uh and we just you know

273
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,310
use this you talk about what's your

274
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,460
carbon footprint

275
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:57,079
what what's your land footprint in terms

276
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,120
of food production and this is is the

277
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,490
six ounce diet it takes one point nine

278
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,259
acres per person you want to know the

279
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,070
metric units there in the previous slide

280
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:09,769
and here's back here zero grams of eaten

281
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:14,240
and Diet takes half an acre for purse

282
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:18,448
this amounts this Fed the most people

283
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,568
with the two ounces of beat and that's

284
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:26,128
equal to about the size of a deck of

285
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:29,309
playing cards per day a little more than

286
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:33,300
1/8 and then this one with all that meat

287
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:36,568
that's three quarter pounders but there

288
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:39,120
you see there's a huge impact on how

289
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:42,990
much land it takes based on on your diet

290
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,060
very very interesting work the other

291
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,240
thing we were able to do because of the

292
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:51,179
way the the maps were coded for New York

293
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,060
State we could see where the food had to

294
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:56,549
come from and he developed the concept

295
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,979
of the food shed and this shows the area

296
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,719
around major cities in New York that

297
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,870
would feed all the people in that

298
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,019
population center well all the people in

299
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,938
the circle and it turns out that for

300
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,399
most of the cities in New York State we

301
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:14,278
actually have what amounts to a local

302
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,289
food system that is potentially we're

303
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,870
dealing only with foods produced in New

304
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:21,028
York what that means there's there's no

305
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,360
oranges and no bananas they got to get

306
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:26,490
your vitamin C from sauerkraut or

307
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,970
something else or other sources but that

308
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:34,230
that's one of the assumptions so this is

309
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,360
how it works out and he was developed an

310
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,120
optimization procedure to go with the

311
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,579
model so he minimized the distance that

312
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,500
food had to travel to feed everybody and

313
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,239
he come up with this interesting kind of

314
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,159
map and what you see here's the

315
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,620
population back I estimated I think 2005

316
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,269
for Buffalo and so forth and this is the

317
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,578
percent of the food needs you can meet

318
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,669
for Buffalo Rochester and Syracuse you

319
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,859
can virtually feed all the people with

320
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:04,799
that local food system and this is the

321
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,259
distance that the food has to travel and

322
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,179
average across the whole state including

323
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:14,220
New York and Poughkeepsie is just 30

324
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:17,729
miles but if you put New York City in

325
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,309
there the whole thing blows up you can't

326
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,558
really feed New York City and what the

327
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:23,579
local food sheds look like are not very

328
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:26,939
local anymore

329
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,940
because New York City to minimize the

330
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,290
miles is robbing from the other cities

331
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,290
this is what's going on here

332
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:39,939
so that that was very interesting we had

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,039
a lot of local food sheds we could feed

334
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,050
about a third of the people in New York

335
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,849
State with the land that is in New York

336
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,129
State we're always going to have to

337
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,129
improve import food into New York State

338
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:53,559
with our present populations the next

339
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:55,750
thing we did was to compare the states

340
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,000
and when I just showed you for it for

341
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,330
New York State we can feed about 1/3 of

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,519
the people doing the best we can and

343
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,100
that cows will actually increase the

344
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,769
food supply because it allows us to use

345
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,710
land in a sustainable way that we

346
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,659
otherwise could not when we go to

347
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,560
Michigan

348
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:20,589
lots of agricultural land no problems

349
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,299
nothing interesting there they could

350
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,019
just feed themselves about anything we

351
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:27,819
did go to New Mexico big surprise

352
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,970
they've got all this waste land all this

353
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,570
rangeland classified land and new New

354
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,470
Mexico but every cow in the state

355
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:42,490
reduced the food supply

356
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:46,870
what's going on cows have to be fed in

357
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:49,690
the wintertime the winter feed for cows

358
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:53,169
comes from irrigated land irrigated

359
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,860
alfalfa for the most part every acre of

360
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:59,828
irrigated alfalfa reduces other food

361
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,720
crops that could have been on that land

362
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:06,549
so in this land configuration every acre

363
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,588
or every cow in the state actually

364
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,259
decreased the amount of food they were

365
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:14,188
producing I don't know if the Cowboys

366
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:16,689
out there would like to hear that but

367
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:18,910
anyhow that's that's what happens when

368
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:24,069
the cows compete for the land you've got

369
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:26,350
some problems ok let's go back to or

370
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:29,289
continue with our study of the 48

371
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,240
contiguous states adjacent states we're

372
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,129
looking at this human dietary need

373
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,490
complete balanced diet I showed you

374
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,050
those numbers before I was not involved

375
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,630
in the study but Chris and his graduate

376
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,549
students actually developed a more

377
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,919
sophisticated model than we had in the

378
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,379
first one regarding livestock good

379
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,070
livestock feed deed model they were

380
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,919
still 186 different foods and feeds but

381
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,569
the losses calculated the land types and

382
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,390
the area is now in production

383
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:00,849
this is all potential no changes in

384
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,890
population or land and we wanted this

385
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:07,619
sustainable cropping system

386
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,960
sustainable land use and so what that

387
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,089
looks like now is what I've showed you

388
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,130
before the eight classes we're saying

389
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:17,220
this is our definition of sustainable

390
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,950
and with these conservation tillage your

391
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,890
crop rotations and then out here looking

392
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,840
at the whole United States and

393
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:28,770
subtracting the land using to grow used

394
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:31,168
to grow cotton tobacco ornamentals and

395
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:35,690
so forth you end up with ninety five

396
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:39,720
million hectares in food production in

397
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:43,500
classes one and two some of class two

398
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,150
maybe in in forage crops actually all of

399
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,619
it could be if you're dedicated to cows

400
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,409
then we have thirty nine million

401
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,259
hectares that we call Grace cropland

402
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:57,990
that's in in classes three and four

403
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,669
where you need to have cover crops you

404
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,890
don't need to graze them but they're

405
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:05,400
there and you can and so called that

406
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,490
grace cropland we can grow some crops

407
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,630
some of the time on these categories and

408
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,609
then you get down here and from five

409
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,460
seven really we have two hundred ninety

410
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:22,558
nine million hectares in permanent

411
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,840
grazing land in the United States that

412
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:30,019
are as best we could figure out being

413
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:31,789
used to produce food to get that

414
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,450
this is really important looking at

415
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:38,899
sustainable land use we have 95 million

416
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,690
hectares of cultivated problem if we're

417
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,360
using conservation telly troops we're

418
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,970
using conservation tillage that's all of

419
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,000
class - if not summer class - will be

420
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:53,120
down here in this category there are 39

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,190
million hectares of grazed cropland this

422
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,919
is land we can grow crops on some of the

423
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,759
time but not all of the time and then

424
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,200
down here classes 5 &amp; 6 299 million

425
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:08,650
hectares of what amounts to rangeland I

426
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,900
should have put in some picture slides

427
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,880
but to show you what rangeland in New

428
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,490
York State looks like but as you get

429
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,340
close to the Adirondack Mountains you

430
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:23,089
get shallow soils - - limestone bedrock

431
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:25,220
and we don't usually talk about range in

432
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,720
New York State I've seen a lot of the

433
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,759
western range and doesn't look any

434
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,309
different doesn't produce any difference

435
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,160
one of the calculations that that they

436
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,589
did in the animal model is what is the

437
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,950
production potential of all this land

438
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:42,049
and the average based on how much meat

439
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,360
they're producing they didn't go out and

440
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,559
measure the yield was something less

441
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:51,709
than 700 pounds per acre across that

442
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:57,859
land but you can use it and can use it

443
00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:01,519
to grow beef or lamb then what we wanted

444
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:04,279
to do in this study of the 48 adjacent

445
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,609
States was to compare different diets

446
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,649
and I'll go over this several times but

447
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:11,750
this is the code we have the baseline

448
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,890
diet that's the current way we're eating

449
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,710
right now

450
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:21,360
USDA has the information then we have a

451
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:24,298
positive control the POS diet that is we

452
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,028
get rid of the excesses in the diet

453
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:29,730
we're over consuming calories and we

454
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:31,528
create a balanced diet formulate a

455
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,230
balanced diet that has a right amount of

456
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:35,909
calories in it and then we make further

457
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:40,009
changes we have an omnivorous diet

458
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:42,450
that's 100% healthy down to 20 percent

459
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,740
healthy omnivorous then we look at

460
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:49,500
ovo-lacto vegetarian with eggs milk

461
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,630
lacto-vegetarian with milk and the vegan

462
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,450
diet with no animal products at all and

463
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,210
we make those comparisons of how many

464
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,490
people could we feed on those acres in

465
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,579
the United States so this actually looks

466
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,500
at the ten diets in detail right now the

467
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:05,250
average person in the United States is

468
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,069
concerning

469
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:13,169
28:44 kilocalories per day and this this

470
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:15,089
is the animal protein and the vegetable

471
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,519
protein and the calculation how many

472
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:21,898
acres it takes to feed that person that

473
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:24,750
died then you drop it down to the 2153

474
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:27,359
which was calculated an adequate diet

475
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,690
and only change is in the fat and the

476
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,569
diet this is still an excessive protein

477
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,850
diet

478
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:37,950
according to nutritional standards and

479
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:38,490
that's why we go from the positive

480
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,308
control

481
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:45,058
let's just stop over eating calories do

482
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:47,609
the balanced omnivorous diet which now

483
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,470
we're dropping the protein level to what

484
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:53,038
the recommendation say we should be

485
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:58,110
consuming improved and then we just add

486
00:22:53,038 --> 00:23:00,808
more well we start adding

487
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:02,519
vegetarian components to the diet as we

488
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,750
decrease the omnivorous components and

489
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,990
you can look what's going on and

490
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:11,009
interestingly the acres per person for

491
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:13,109
these diets if minimizing acres to feed

492
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,920
one person is your definition of what is

493
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:18,779
sustainable

494
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,700
the vegan diets the most sustainable and

495
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:26,700
people think well that's that's the

496
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:30,269
obvious answer but it's not here are the

497
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,309
populations we actually can feed with

498
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:35,190
those different diets and this is the

499
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:39,000
percent of the u.s. cropland that is

500
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,680
used and you see the vegan diet feeds

501
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,170
fewer people than the lacto-vegetarian

502
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,660
diet this was the best one in terms of

503
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,160
feeding number of people because it's

504
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:52,019
using less land the land sustainability

505
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,630
kicking in if you're not going to have

506
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:56,369
animals in your system what are you

507
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,500
going to do with those forages you plow

508
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:02,339
them down hopefully that'll increase the

509
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,700
yields which was not calculated but

510
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,919
anyhow this diet the lacto-vegetarian

511
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,330
this is two hundred and sixty one

512
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:16,380
percent of the 2010 population of the

513
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:19,769
United States population in the United

514
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:23,820
States right now what is that 325 326

515
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:25,799
million so all of the diets we have a

516
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,500
land base in the United States that

517
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,450
provides more food than we need maybe

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,000
that's part of the reason why we're

519
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,000
overeating we've got a food industry

520
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,960
that advertises eat more eat more

521
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,960
because we've cut it to sell I that's

522
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,940
not the only factor I looks like to eat

523
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,460
but anyhow these these are the numbers

524
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,039
of people that we can feed the land area

525
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,319
required and again it takes the leased

526
00:24:50,039 --> 00:25:00,240
land area for the vegan diet but it

527
00:24:52,319 --> 00:25:06,059
doesn't feed as many people how are we

528
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:09,779
using that cropland we have 95 million

529
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:12,210
hectares of cropland that that we could

530
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,269
crop and in this baseline diet we're

531
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,579
only using 71 million hectares up not

532
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:19,920
the base the baseline diet because we

533
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:22,710
have so much livestock and we're

534
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,820
producing livestock feed and so forth

535
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,819
for the perennial cropland

536
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:30,500
the unused cropland the neat you know

537
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:33,309
this is all the cropland lands that

538
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:39,799
where we can cultivate that we can plow

539
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:41,539
and we're using all of it and in these

540
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,269
diets but when we get down here because

541
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,460
of the conservation requirement on the

542
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:49,250
class three and for land less and less

543
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,829
can be used as we're providing more and

544
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,109
more vegetable products into the diet

545
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:56,809
and you can also see in that two hundred

546
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:59,329
ninety nine million acres of rangeland

547
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:02,059
or grazing land when you get down here

548
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:05,689
just forty percent of the 100 percent

549
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:09,109
omnivorous diet fraction of that land

550
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,600
we're using starts dropping and we get

551
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,490
down here to the vegetarian diets and

552
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,449
the vegan diet we're not using any of

553
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,450
the Ranger

554
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:26,879
in the United States now I've put these

555
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,129
numbers in red because the question

556
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,560
comes up and looking at the validity of

557
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:35,730
this somewhat theoretical you know we're

558
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,859
using published data but are all the

559
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:42,630
assumptions what they should be what if

560
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:45,289
we could use this unused cropland for

561
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,290
different crops

562
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:54,000
that maybe is a clue to how to increase

563
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:57,119
the food supply in developing new crops

564
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,940
but as a modeler let's just change the

565
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,119
numbers with sensitivity enough and see

566
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,730
what happens is it possible to grow food

567
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:09,538
crops on the unused perennial cropland

568
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,690
at three classes three and four for the

569
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:14,779
most part that is more teacups more nuts

570
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,669
more apples and so forth and are not

571
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:19,678
things that we could put on a fairly

572
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,270
steep land whatever they would be and

573
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,419
how does this affect the rankings and

574
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:26,158
the analysis no there's a sensitivity

575
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:30,030
analysis and you can look at everything

576
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,179
but anyway the vegan diet became equal

577
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:36,139
to the oval lacto and the

578
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,169
lacto-vegetarian diet if we could put

579
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,520
92% of that class three and four land

580
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:46,210
into crops every year

581
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:50,139
right now the baseline you know in RCS

582
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:55,600
is only 71% is there so what is needed

583
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:58,030
to get to move that way is to have crops

584
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,459
that we can put on that marginal steep

585
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:05,558
land that produce food in a perennial

586
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:08,200
way move toward getting perennial cereal

587
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,670
crops and so forth might might help and

588
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,590
of course research is going on in that

589
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:17,860
area so concluding comments got a lot of

590
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:19,959
time to talk about this first of all the

591
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:23,349
diet has a big influence in how many

592
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,190
people that we can feed this is dawn but

593
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:29,589
this is giving quantitative information

594
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,808
on that particular factor the vegetarian

595
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:33,389
and vegan diets do take the least amount

596
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:36,210
of land

597
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:40,710
if you're concerned about carbon

598
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:43,079
sequestration and wildland if wild

599
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:48,500
places for wild animals to live and so

600
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:53,519
forth of vegan diets good for them but

601
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:55,589
sustainable use of land now in

602
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,710
production will provide feed for

603
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:01,500
livestock that will produce meat and

604
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,130
milk in the diet so actually more people

605
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:10,819
can be fed with - modest amounts of

606
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,820
animal products in in the diet

607
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,089
just looking at that study in New Mexico

608
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,140
I think that's an interesting point

609
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:24,139
livestock can compete

610
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:31,360
with food crops for the use of cropland

611
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:34,240
and so that will reduce the food supply

612
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,069
where that happens if you have a land

613
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,470
resource such as we have in New York

614
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:41,619
State or Michigan I didn't look in

615
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,750
detail where we have enough marginal

616
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:46,359
steep land that we can feed our

617
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,909
livestock justing out what their raishin

618
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:52,928
is then animals are going to increase

619
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:57,070
the food supply the local food Chad's

620
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:59,048
oops come back the local food sheds this

621
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:00,700
is a recent study I just showed you in

622
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,798
New York City blows the thing up and

623
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,808
I've been saying for years as I talk

624
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,460
about this I don't have any idea how

625
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,990
we're going to feed New York City how

626
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,139
we're going to feed Los Angeles and

627
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,878
Tokyo in Mexico City thinking about a

628
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:14,918
local food system

629
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:17,109
urban agriculture will make a

630
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:21,000
significant contribution but they're

631
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:23,319
still going to have to import food and

632
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,878
Chris's and these graduate students have

633
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:29,648
looked at other cities on the coast and

634
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:32,678
if you're only halfway surrounded by

635
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:36,069
agricultural land or worse than that by

636
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,649
mountains and rocks like New York City a

637
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:40,808
local food system is not going to be

638
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:43,778
possible we're going to have to continue

639
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:48,099
to import food into those big coastal

640
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:49,538
cities or get people out there I don't

641
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:54,250
know if you want to think about that the

642
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:56,919
sensitivity analysis shows that the use

643
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,099
of the cropland pasture has a changes

644
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,880
the results on the ranking we're

645
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:07,029
assuming what is sustainable land use

646
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,120
so that we've got 39 million hectares of

647
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:12,609
cropland in the United States the 48

648
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,339
states that have to have a lot of

649
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:18,279
forages on them for sustainable use if

650
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:22,139
that could change that would change the

651
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:25,839
comparison of the different nights and

652
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:29,110
vegan diet would become more acceptable

653
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,819
the last thing we see this is being

654
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:33,490
recorded to have to be careful how I say

655
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:36,009
this but some proponents of the vegan

656
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:40,690
diet are very suspicious about results

657
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:43,869
in fact they were almost livid I've

658
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,140
never done any any work that has brought

659
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:51,779
so much response from the public as this

660
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:55,000
particular work because people

661
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:58,168
advocating vegan diets just were sure

662
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,669
that it would feed the most people and

663
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,409
they didn't like the idea that that was

664
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,419
not the most sustainable method you

665
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:06,669
could use I don't know how you want to

666
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:09,889
define sustainability certainly the

667
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:13,019
vegan diet used the lease plan

668
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:17,819
but it had a lot of unused land that

669
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:19,618
that affected the results so this is

670
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:25,069
where I want to stop and I'm given

671
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:28,468
myself too much time for questions but I

672
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:32,189
think you get yet the idea of what we

673
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:35,788
have been been doing and I think it's

674
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,830
pretty interesting it was nice to have

675
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:40,798
Chris Peters here's my graduate student

676
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:43,259
and then postdoc and his work I think

677
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,499
who set up his whole career he's getting

678
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:47,788
grants publishing lots of papers

679
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:55,999
continuing to work on the modeling of

680
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:55,999
food systems and he's gotten tenure yes

681
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:06,019
this has been a production of Cornell

682
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:06,019
University on the web at Cornell edu
