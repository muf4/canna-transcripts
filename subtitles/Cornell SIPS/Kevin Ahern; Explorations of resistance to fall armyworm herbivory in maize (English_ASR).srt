1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,849
University everybody it really is a

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,150
privilege and an honor to be here in

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,480
front of you all today as some of you

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:19,219
know I've been at the boys Thomson

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,368
Institute for 17 years now and I

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:27,239
literally started out taking out the

8
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:31,820
trash and washing glassware so I've sort

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:35,250
of clawed my way up to the top right so

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,128
last year I got her early as last year I

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,808
started getting interested in well I

12
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,859
should say since I joined George

13
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:46,530
jander's lab he works on he's a chemical

14
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:50,128
ecologist basically and he's worked on

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,640
insects read mecha plant insect

16
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:56,519
interactions for quite a while and just

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,980
got into maze about the time that I

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,359
started in his lab and about four or

19
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:06,329
five years ago now so when I was sort of

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,700
looking for a project I started thinking

21
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,118
about fall army worm and what a big

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,960
problem it's sort of become and so a

23
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,938
little bit about fall army worm

24
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,368
it's a generalist lepidopteran herbivore

25
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:24,658
that feeds on over a hundred plant

26
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:27,780
species and but it prefers grasses in

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,780
fact most crop plants that are grasses

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,689
most cranes feeding occurs primarily in

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,460
the world at night and crop losses can

30
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,938
literally approach hundred percent if

31
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:42,118
not controlled using modified BT

32
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:48,779
germplasm or using synthetic

33
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:50,430
insecticides it's the most we know about

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,560
the genetic control about it is that

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,509
it's a complex trait controlled by at

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,799
least seven QTL that explains 48% of the

37
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:03,228
phenotypic variants so

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,560
when I really got into thinking about

39
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:12,680
this was when fall army woman was

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:15,430
discovered in Africa in 2016 and as of

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,689
just as past September this report here

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,400
if any of you are interested in this at

43
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,859
all this just came out in September it's

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,230
really good and comprehensive and really

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,800
scary as to how bad the situation is in

46
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,799
Africa right now

47
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,859
now they've surveyed 54 countries and

48
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,959
it's been found in 28 of these countries

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,480
and so it's a huge problem because the

50
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,870
primary management strategy is to

51
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,030
increase pesticide use and if the

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:51,170
chemicals can be obtained especially by

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:53,959
a small farm small holder farmers and so

54
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:58,399
we know that there's a genetic variance

55
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,500
and thanks to Nick for these photos in

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,819
fact this is really I should say this is

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,430
really a project that Nick and I are

58
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:05,958
doing together if it wasn't for him and

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,269
heads group for providing me the seed

60
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,250
and Margaret for moving the germ plasm

61
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,189
forward I wouldn't be doing this so I

62
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,919
just want to throw that out there so I

63
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,989
on the left you can see this is B 73

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:23,119
this is whoops this is the reference

65
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:25,489
genome and it's we it's susceptible to a

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,950
farm II worm and on the right this is MP

67
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,009
7 or 6 this is a line that was improved

68
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,768
in Mississippi by Paul Williams and it's

69
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:36,379
derived from more tropical germ plasm

70
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:39,469
and and so with the problem in Africa

71
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:41,419
let me know Nick and I both to ask these

72
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,780
questions what are their genetic factors

73
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,509
that contribute to and are by osis you

74
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,719
know producing chemicals to harm the

75
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:53,328
pest ant eyes enosis maybe the pestle

76
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,389
just go someplace else or tolerance

77
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:59,920
where the plant can actually handle

78
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:02,318
getting attacked and produce grain

79
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,000
and then well what are the biochemical

80
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,299
pathways and compounds conferring

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,209
armyworm resistance in maize we know a

82
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,010
little bit about resistance and other

83
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,849
caterpillars and our lab will use

84
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:17,379
primarily beat army worm and so ours is

85
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,409
the same is it the different

86
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,290
they're pretty closely related but they

87
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,520
the mechanisms could be different and

88
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,650
then how can we leverage the vast

89
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,659
natural diversity found in maize to

90
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,879
address these questions in a rapid

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,790
manner because the situation so dire in

92
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:39,850
Africa and American farmers could use to

93
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,590
serve information too so we started with

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,560
when I got talking with Nick about this

95
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:48,039
and how bad it was in Africa he's like I

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,139
have lines I have seed and that I've

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,479
improved over about ten years and

98
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:57,579
they're ready to go to test them and I

99
00:04:52,478 --> 00:05:01,029
said great now I have a project so so

100
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:03,490
and I hope if hopefully I'm okay on

101
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,989
these genetics so you guys can shout out

102
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,650
or thumb wrong because these were

103
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,150
developed by Nick and the buccal lab and

104
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:13,449
the initial goal is to develop an early

105
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:17,319
flowering temperate adapted farming worm

106
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:19,209
resistant inbred lines to use in the US

107
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,550
because if climate change is real which

108
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,129
I think most of us think it is that

109
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:27,240
offers an opportunity for the army worm

110
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:29,709
to expand its range in the US because

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,750
well I can't diapause so it can't

112
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:34,959
survive the winters up here but it does

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,660
just fine in South Florida and in South

114
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,219
Texas and then it moves up here in the

115
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,500
summertime and usually gets to western

116
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,370
New York about right around pollination

117
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,399
time mid to late late August so the big

118
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,579
population was the NAMM founders the

119
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:55,359
NAMM founders are 25 diverse in breads

120
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:57,339
that were back cross to be 73 to make

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,288
recombinant inbred lines so these are

122
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,149
just the the founders of that population

123
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:04,810
and they were open pollinated in a pail

124
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:08,379
across block design and they just let it

125
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,228
fly and harvested it and then took all

126
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,639
the seed put it in a in a bin pulled it

127
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:14,769
and then

128
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,689
planted it out the next season and I

129
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:20,258
selected for early flowering time for

130
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:23,110
the next two seasons and then planted it

131
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,788
down in Puerto Rico and selected for

132
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,580
fall army worm resistance under pressure

133
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:29,339
they are underneath self pollinated for

134
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:33,668
another six to nine generations to

135
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:36,399
maximize homozygosity so we also decided

136
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:39,008
to look at five African accessions 2x

137
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,138
plant variety protection acts accessions

138
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,968
of opposing heterotic ropes or stiff

139
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,259
stock and non-stiff stock so you could

140
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:48,158
test for combining ability to make

141
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:50,620
resistant hybrids and so our evaluation

142
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:53,918
scheme was going to be we wanted to do a

143
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,990
whole plant no choice ese to assess

144
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,240
Caterpillar performance and to survey

145
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,610
damage tissue for induced secondary

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,500
metabolites we also wanted to do choice

147
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,819
s I used to distinguish susceptible from

148
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:09,069
resistant genotypes and things I have in

149
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,810
the queue is that these inbred lines are

150
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,639
currently being sequenced and we hope to

151
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,110
do some gos on them genome-wide

152
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,788
Association studies and then we're also

153
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,528
I'm mostly looking at historical data

154
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:26,740
from 2015 and 2016 in Puerto Rico to do

155
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:29,098
some gos on those perhaps so here's the

156
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,079
no choice performance test we have a

157
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,300
chamber at BTI down the basement and we

158
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,399
got some perforated bread bags to hold

159
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,699
the little critters in there we put one

160
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,990
army worm in the world a plant wood

161
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,598
because that's their preferred feeding

162
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,569
site and then let them go for a week and

163
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:51,430
then we retrieve the caterpillars a week

164
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:53,710
later and also so we'd weigh them for to

165
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,269
measure performance because if they

166
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,838
don't like the plant they won't feed on

167
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:01,359
it or they'll feed on it less and then

168
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:04,019
we also collected the damaged tissue

169
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,250
because specialized metabolites are

170
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,899
usually accumulated the feeding site

171
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,598
that's been found to be true and some

172
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:14,019
basic studies and so that's in the

173
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:16,300
future and we also photograph some of

174
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,938
these damaged tissue hopefully to

175
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,829
calculate a damaged leaf area index in

176
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:24,009
the future with software

177
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:26,408
and this is about the size so these are

178
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,240
neonates these are about one day old as

179
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:33,458
soon as they hatched we we put them on

180
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,370
the plants and so here's the results the

181
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:39,278
red ones are African the cyan ones are

182
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,889
though Knicks lines that he improved the

183
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:46,360
gray ones are xx plant variety

184
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:48,399
Protection Act lines then the green ones

185
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,649
the MP 7 or 6 or resisting control and

186
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,100
then the blue one is e 73 the reference

187
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,509
genome and so when I did the ANOVA

188
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:01,389
analysis

189
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:03,189
bummer no significant difference so you

190
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,419
know and so you can look at the sample

191
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,209
sizes here they're a little bit all over

192
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,849
the place and you can also see that we

193
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:13,299
have some extreme outliers here and

194
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,950
these are not entering the data wrong

195
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:19,870
these were fat caterpillars so so I

196
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,180
think we need to do some more reps or

197
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,269
improve our methods on this this type of

198
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:28,149
assay so we also want to do a choice

199
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:32,528
performance test we put 14 inbred leaf

200
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:34,690
death in a in a tray we put 100 neonates

201
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:37,059
in there and then did 10 replicates for

202
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,100
most of the hybrids we scored day later

203
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,229
and then measured the number of

204
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,970
caterpillars on a disk and then assign

205
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,430
them a damage score from 0 to 5

206
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,519
and this is you can see that there's

207
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:53,009
variation between the lines some are

208
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,269
definitely getting munched on more than

209
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,759
others

210
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:00,940
and some of Nick's lines here are doing

211
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,789
pretty well versus the resistant MP 706

212
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,270
and then when you look at the so the

213
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:09,819
orange bars are the damaged scores so I

214
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,549
sorted by damage score from least damage

215
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,950
to most damage and then the caterpillar

216
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:16,929
weights are in cyan and the number of

217
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,350
categories I should say and cyan and

218
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:25,109
they're kind of all over the place and

219
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:28,990
there's a hem P 706 and there's b73 and

220
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:33,039
when I did a anova and a Tukey's HSD

221
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,110
test these three lines MP 706 and to the

222
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,759
improved lines were significantly better

223
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,039
than B 73 and they were not any

224
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,179
significantly different than MP 706 so

225
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,809
these are probably pretty good

226
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:50,379
candidates to move forward since they do

227
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:53,289
just as well as the resistant line and

228
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:55,149
then I've just looked at some historical

229
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:56,439
data to try and nail down some QTL I'm

230
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,100
going to fly through this because I'm

231
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,860
out of time but basically Nick had some

232
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,139
other scores from the field in Puerto

233
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,899
Rico and we used these scores as a

234
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:11,830
phenotypic trait to try and map things

235
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:13,480
with the G wasps and we we had sets from

236
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,870
both the name recombinant inbred lines

237
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,050
and the Mays diversity panel which is

238
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,169
about 280 lines

239
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:24,809
and then you can see on this is just a

240
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:27,958
sample from 2013 this is a generalized

241
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:32,939
linear model with a we were practicing

242
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:34,889
with tassel I admit and we only use 11

243
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,440
original eleven hundred and forty four

244
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:42,269
steps from the NAMM set and for the

245
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,959
diversity panel we used our H and V one

246
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:48,419
hat may have so kind of an outdated

247
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:51,989
version of step data but you can see

248
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,729
that some Peaks are sort of showing up

249
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,259
I mean it's some are the same and some

250
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,310
are different let's just put it that way

251
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:01,200
and so the conclusions here is that the

252
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:04,049
phenotypic data we need to be more

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,269
quantitative and because it needs to

254
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,458
show less variance for sure and we could

255
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:12,440
do that by laughing caterpillars for

256
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:14,819
weight weighing imaging software

257
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,970
secondary metabolites gene expression

258
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,800
and for the Association mapping the

259
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,829
models need to be improved we need to

260
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,588
run some mix linear models be drawn with

261
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:28,338
higher snip density and also to account

262
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:31,200
for kinship and environmental covariance

263
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,089
so thank you guys I couldn't fit every

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:41,899
one I needed to thank on one slide so I

265
00:12:33,089 --> 00:13:11,579
thank you all we have any questions

266
00:12:41,899 --> 00:13:13,948
Rachel oh yeah they don't move around

267
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:18,059
too much from whatever I'd yeah that's

268
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:19,649
true no we haven't done that we'd have

269
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,289
to think about that experimental design

270
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,458
how would you do that it would would

271
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,610
either have to have a sealed-off room

272
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,799
with karo but moths flying around

273
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,960
because we don't want them getting out

274
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,759
or yeah that's

275
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:46,670
would I even thought about that great

276
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:53,429
idea that's my great question great

277
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:56,039
question I don't know I don't know how

278
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:57,359
rapidly these evolved maybe I should

279
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:13,110
have this discussion with George maybe

280
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:18,769
he would know well that's a geopolitical

281
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:23,159
thing right yeah right

282
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,528
no that's that's a great idea

283
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,149
[Music]

284
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:28,850
yeah there must be BTN breads out there

285
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:34,078
I don't I don't do you know

286
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:36,329
yeah yeah right good call well I mean

287
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,489
the MP lines are pretty resistant I mean

288
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:40,078
but the year right that's not what we

289
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,610
want to be growing in Africa is the

290
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,958
Mississippi ones I don't think maybe I

291
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,850
did try to do I did try to do some

292
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,250
crosses in African germplasm is here in

293
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,649
Aurora and there was just that's growing

294
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,350
degree days were too long

295
00:14:53,649 --> 00:15:02,100
this has been a production of Cornell
