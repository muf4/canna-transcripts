1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,240
hello and welcome everybody to the

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,559
cornell hemp field days

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
my name is jacob toast and i'm a phd

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,439
candidate in larry smart clap and today

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,359
i'll be talking

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,359
about molecular breeding of hemp

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
for my talk today i'll be discussing

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
some of the

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
theory and ideas behind molecular

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
breeding attempt

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,320
and give an example of how we're using

12
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,479
molecular breeding in our research

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,439
program to develop a high-yielding

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
fiber cultivar that has low levels of

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
thc

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,920
to stay compliant as well as produces

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
high levels of cbd

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
it is important to recognize the

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,280
contribution of genetics and environment

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,679
to your trait of interest

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
for any breeding endeavor so how the

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,960
plant grows

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
the phenotype is there about there's the

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
result of both

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
the genetics of the plant as well as the

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,920
environment

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,359
the genetics of the plant also known as

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
the genotype

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,519
refers to the dna of the plants

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,679
the genes and other dna which make up

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,799
the plant's genome

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,640
so many important traits such as yields

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
are heavily influenced by both the

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
genotype and the environment

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,478
but some traits such as photoperiod

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,840
dependence and cannabinoid

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,679
are heavily influenced by genotype alone

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,280
concerning photoperiod dependence if you

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,360
look at this picture here

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519
the small plant is photoperiod

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,079
independent and started flowering

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,200
almost immediately after planting while

43
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,679
the larger plant

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
which is fully period dependent didn't

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
start flowering

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
until the night length hit a certain

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,200
threshold

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
so another important trait that is

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
influenced heavily by genotype

50
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,078
in cannabis is cannabinoid type and

51
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,239
breeding for cannabinoid type is a

52
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,239
fundamental part of any hemp reading

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,240
so what is molecular breathing so

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,079
in molecular breeding very broadly

55
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,839
instead of just looking at the phenotype

56
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,078
of the plant which is the result of both

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,800
the genotype and the environment

58
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:11,439
you look at the actual dna

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
so advances in molecular biology have

60
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,520
allowed

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,800
much easier analysis of dna

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
and because the dna is the same in every

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
cell

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,719
of a plant whether it's young or whether

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
it's old

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,400
being able to assay a plant just by

67
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,878
looking at the dna allows you

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
to look at certain traits before they're

69
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,719
even expressed

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
for instance to determine if a plant is

71
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
going to be male or female

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,629
or if it's going to produce mostly thc

73
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,759
or mostly cbd

74
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,400
[Music]

75
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,079
so with molecular breeding you can

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
develop new cultivars based on the

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,280
genotype alone

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:52,159
and when done accurately this can result

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,318
in less expensive phenotyping and

80
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,159
ultimately reducing the cost

81
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,679
and reducing the time it takes to

82
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,680
develop a new cultivar

83
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,359
now i'm going to talk a little bit about

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,360
how our research group is using

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,560
molecular breeding to develop

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,920
new elite high-yielding fiber cultivars

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
that have compliant levels of thc

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,238
in 2019 we grew several varieties for

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
grain and fiber production

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
including two cultivars from china

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,439
called bama and puma

92
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,280
we didn't know much about these

93
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,318
cultivars when you first planted them

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,039
aside from

95
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,359
a little blurb for puma which claimed to

96
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,318
have

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
high cbd seeds high leaves and flowers

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,839
output

99
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,280
when these plants are grown we were

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
quite impressed by the plants

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
in that they had extremely large leaves

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
and extremely fast

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,200
growth rate and would routinely hit 10

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,039
feet tall

105
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,280
when we harvested these plants and

106
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,679
breaded them to measure the fiber yields

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,158
we found that dama and puma had nearly

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,959
doubled the biomass yield of other elite

109
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,798
cultivars grown for fiber

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
because of this we thought that puma

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,360
would make excellent fiber cultivators

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,959
however when we looked at the

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
cannabinoids

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,158
we found that both puma and bama

115
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,359
produced

116
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:14,399
thc at levels exceeding 0.3

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,560
and would be non-compliant in

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
the modern regulatory framework

119
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,879
we looked further at the cannabinoids

120
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
that huma and bama were producing and we

121
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,759
found that they were relatively high in

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
cannabinoids

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
with puma producing a little over 1.5

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
percent

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
total cannabinoids and dama sometimes

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,680
exceeding 2

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,879
total cannabinoids this is considerably

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,840
higher than

129
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,120
what other fiber cultivars produced in

130
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,879
terms of total cannabinoids additionally

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,319
we sampled these plants when they were

132
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,719
just starting to flower

133
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,918
so we hypothesized that as the plant

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
became more mature

135
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,639
the total cannabinoids would increase

136
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:58,000
even further however the big problem was

137
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,280
that puma and bama produced

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,959
thc as a major cannabinoid which isn't

139
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,599
what we wanted so ultimately

140
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,000
what we would like in a cultivar would

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,199
be something that produces as much dry

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,918
biomass as puma and vama but instead of

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,120
producing

144
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,439
thc produces cbd

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,399
and to achieve that goal we turn to

146
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,399
molecular breeding

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
so to understand what we did for

148
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,359
molecular breeding it's just

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,120
important to understand the different

150
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,280
chemotypes that are found in cannabis

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
so there are three important chemotypes

152
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,918
that i'll talk about right now there's

153
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
type 1 which is

154
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,560
mostly thc there's type 2 which is cbd

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
to phc

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
about a 2 1 ratio but this number can

157
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,799
vary

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
and then there's type 3 which produces

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
mostly cbd

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
so if you're growing a population or a

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
cultivar

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,560
for cbd you'd expect all the plants to

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
be type 3

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,240
but in 2018 and 2019 we found that some

165
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,359
of the plants

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,759
that we were growing were in fact type 2

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,919
or even type 1 producing almost no cbd

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,038
using this data and this figure in the

169
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,318
top here shows

170
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,079
data from 2018 we developed a molecular

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
marker which looks at the dna of the

172
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,079
plants and can distinguish

173
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:25,120
type 1 from type 2 and type 3 planets

174
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,918
so getting back to bama and puma when we

175
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,840
were looking at the thc to cbd ratio

176
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,959
for these plants we saw that it was

177
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,879
about a 2 1 ratio of cbd to thc

178
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,719
which would suggest that most of the

179
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,759
plants that we were sampling

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880
were type 2 so an interesting thing

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
about these type 2

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,240
plants is that they won't breed true

183
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,000
if there's a population which is freely

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
inter-crossing with a lot of these type

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
2 plants you'd expect to see

186
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,079
a certain number to be type 1 and a

187
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,120
certain number to be type

188
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,240
3. so we didn't have the

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,959
hplc the chemical data on a lot of

190
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
different

191
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
plants from bama and puma we were just

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,160
looking at pooled samples

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
but we could apply this molecular marker

194
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
to

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
these populations and distinguish the

196
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,959
different plants

197
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,959
that were in these different chemotypes

198
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,359
so late last year around december we

199
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,198
grew about 100 plants each of bama and

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
puma and tested them with this marker

201
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,478
that we developed

202
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,598
and as expected we found that about half

203
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,000
of the plants

204
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,439
were type 2 and we found that about a

205
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
third of the plants were type

206
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,918
3 and then the remainder were type 1.

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
so what we did was we selected the type

208
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,038
3

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,478
and in theory these plants should form

210
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,079
an excellent basis

211
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:50,560
for a high producing fiber cultivar

212
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,560
that produces mostly cbd

213
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,598
however after selection of these type 3

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,038
plants

215
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,639
we run into a few problems with their

216
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,800
propagation

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,478
so these plants which are so vigorous in

218
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
the field were also very vigorous

219
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,878
in a greenhouse and they grew extremely

220
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,079
fast and extremely tall

221
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
sometimes in excess of 14 feet they were

222
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,680
also

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
quite susceptible to various greenhouse

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
pathogens such as thrips and spider

225
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,520
mites

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,599
to make matters worse they appear to be

227
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,240
very photoperiod dependent

228
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,719
and did not flower in the greenhouse in

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,319
the spring when we were growing them

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,280
there were also some issues with cutting

231
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
propagation these plants form a very

232
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,439
nice single stem as you can see in this

233
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,320
photo here

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
but it's not always simple to take a

235
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,039
cutting and root

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,879
that very nice stem so to address this

237
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,879
we're attempting to grow the plants in

238
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,240
the field we've planted them out

239
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,879
and hopefully we'll harvest some grain

240
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,879
at the end of the season which will form

241
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,958
a good basis for scale-up

242
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,919
and we've also sent the cuttings of

243
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,399
these plants

244
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,278
to a collaborator in florida who should

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,000
be able

246
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,000
to grow the plants without any issue

247
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
in summary molecular breathing involves

248
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,199
selection

249
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,240
on the genotype on the dna directly

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,399
family and puma two cultivars from china

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
are high biomass producers but they

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,958
produce high

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,680
non-compliant levels of thc

254
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,759
selection in bama and puma for chemotype

255
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,799
3 plants using a molecular marker should

256
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,799
produce

257
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,120
a high yielding compliant fiber cultivar

258
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,719
these plants here growing in the field

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,320
in new york

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,759
should form the basis of a new compliant

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
fiber cultivar

262
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,919
we hope to harvest the seeds at the end

263
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,559
of the season scale them up

264
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,000
ensure that the resultant plants have

265
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,518
the same biomass

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,879
potential as their parent bama and puma

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,360
populations

268
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,360
and eventually potentially release new

269
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,919
cultivars
