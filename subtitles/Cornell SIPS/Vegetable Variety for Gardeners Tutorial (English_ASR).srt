1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,280
but you get to the eventual varieties

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:19,629
for gardeners website you go to

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:23,618
gardening cornell's edu or gardening dot

6
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:26,349
cils cornell edu both of those will work

7
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:28,509
and so this is the main page of garden

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,649
based learning at Cornell you go to

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:35,170
citizen science going to scroll down on

10
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,299
this page you see we have mental

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,309
varieties for gardeners links to that

12
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:41,589
that project and then we have the

13
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:43,449
vegetables variety trial gardens link

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,070
and their instance the lessons lift the

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,469
vessel varieties for gardeners in New

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,980
York State I'm actually going to open

17
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:53,259
that one right there and we hit this PDF

18
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:57,129
document so this document has been

19
00:00:53,259 --> 00:01:00,488
produced long before I arrived 17 years

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:05,228
ago so a long time it's been coming out

21
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:07,000
here early and in around 2006 the

22
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:10,719
information we are getting from

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,859
commercial research researchers who are

24
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:17,228
doing commercial variety trials that

25
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:19,299
really declined and so we're trying to

26
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:21,310
identify a different way to get

27
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,368
recommended variety list for gardeners

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,530
so we decided to start asking gardeners

29
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:28,659
to share with us varieties that we're

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,478
working well for them and so that's

31
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,210
really how we initiated the vegetable

32
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:38,679
varieties for gardeners citizen science

33
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:41,259
project and I was infused as a six that

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,729
we created this website with some

35
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,159
additional funds

36
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,920
we've sent not on additional funds so

37
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,700
this is the functioning on essentially

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,530
no resources so it's a little

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,549
challenging at times but it still gets

40
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,450
the job done

41
00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:01,930
- great varieties that are grown in New

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,780
York and come up with options to add to

43
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,670
that recommended variety list so when we

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,709
go we're going to come back to the

45
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:15,189
special varieties for gardeners website

46
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:18,459
but first let me go to 2017 design so

47
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,840
this is the design for 2017 and the

48
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,670
reason

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,069
want to go here because I want to

50
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,829
identify a specific variety

51
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:27,359
let's try black seed is Vincent so that

52
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,910
might be a variety that you're going to

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,200
you we're going to want you to tell us

54
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:36,539
how it did in your particular garden

55
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:40,079
trial garden firm actually I'm not even

56
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:46,590
a log into this yet I'm going to just

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:51,230
punch in Sisson and this is pine box and

58
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:59,549
hit search and see what I come up with a

59
00:02:51,229 --> 00:03:04,399
spicy Simpson and this is a map of where

60
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:09,510
lady has been added whoa all right heart

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,420
analysis a little sensitive um so you

62
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:17,159
can see of these are ratings that were

63
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:20,098
provided in previous year and I wonder

64
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,689
patty be from Santa New York and

65
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:29,159
somebody we know I do think that this uh

66
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:32,280
Kay uh Cole I'm pretty sure we know who

67
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:38,400
that is in st. Lawrence as well and you

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:43,979
can see Cee Cee Cee Cee G um on a dog

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:49,469
other uh then a Debbie L was from Orange

70
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:55,108
County an MCC Oneida County and then we

71
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:57,509
have Claudia Claudia from rat looks like

72
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,980
Cortland I think and then Ron here are

73
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,530
thinking about a lot of people we know

74
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,899
because we have black students infants

75
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,560
in our variety trials for many years now

76
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,530
so we want um even if you're already

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,319
listed here or if you're not listed here

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,228
we want to teach adding to the reviews

79
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,870
so if you are already listed here and

80
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:22,319
you know how to get back to this account

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,410
you can ask your review of black because

82
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,829
Simpson its overall cumulative review

83
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,220
over multiple years you don't add a new

84
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,879
review by

85
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,640
year give us um too much data or us to

86
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,699
manage so it is a cumulative review of

87
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,919
laxatives Simpson over the life of that

88
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,629
particular garden we're going to

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,730
actually look at how you add a review

90
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,860
and you can certainly add a detail about

91
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,790
about what happened in any given year

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,040
but we don't do year to here's a

93
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,189
different review for each year and just

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,660
give us too much information so let me

95
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:03,060
go back to if you do not have an account

96
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,460
how do you set up account and that's go

97
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,980
not to register on registered with our

98
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,009
sites so I'm going to add a garden

99
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,509
profile here you simply fill out this

100
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:19,139
information and there is a required you

101
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:22,500
can see which items are required and I

102
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,870
think life some of those counties did I

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,699
would choose um if you have a

104
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,220
demonstration partners for your County I

105
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,439
would choose a demonstration garden for

106
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,750
that particular County if you would like

107
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,310
to do if you have multiple demonstration

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,759
gardens and you want to have multiple

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,069
garden profiles you're welcome to create

110
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,219
multiple Gardens profiles I'll show you

111
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:47,610
another option if you want to keep all

112
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,540
those profiles link but there is a some

113
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,569
limitation to that and so we don't

114
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,439
gather a lot of information about the

115
00:05:54,569 --> 00:06:00,839
garden profile you want to be easy and

116
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,850
and not too complicated

117
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,239
not more information than we can really

118
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,540
manage but let me go back to the login

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,139
and so this is my garden profile and

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,689
over here you can add multiple profiles

121
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,060
I can add an additional garden profile

122
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,699
so if you wanted to have more than one

123
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,009
profile for your county you can put it

124
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,810
in the same I mean yeah more than one

125
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:27,509
garden be covered in the same garden

126
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,240
profile the limitation on that as I said

127
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,550
um there is one you would only be able

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,050
to write one review per variety you

129
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,288
don't try to have that level of

130
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:42,740
complexity so now that I'm actually in

131
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:42,740
there um as me

132
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:49,958
we turn to Rack feed and Simpson if you

133
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,209
ever run into a problem the best thing

134
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,759
because as I said this website was

135
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,738
created a while ago the best thing to do

136
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,229
is this log out and try to get in again

137
00:06:56,738 --> 00:07:02,828
sometimes that corrects the problem and

138
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:05,618
we just make the best we can for being

139
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,478
pretty old website it functions pretty

140
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:09,459
darn well and again we don't have

141
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:13,808
anybody to help with this up we run into

142
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:17,199
a problem where we're a little bit

143
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:22,989
troubled so that's my Hugh Simpson and

144
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:25,689
um here you can share your review once

145
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:27,788
you have and here the review is very

146
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:30,069
simple the reason why we have these very

147
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:32,438
simple questions is because we consulted

148
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,499
with plant-breeding folks and when they

149
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,439
ask they do field trials with growers

150
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:41,469
these are the very basic questions that

151
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,689
they ask growers so we don't want to

152
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:46,209
make it any more complicated to collect

153
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,059
too much data that becomes overwhelming

154
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:52,059
for us there's so much noise when you go

155
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:54,639
into field trial that collecting very

156
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:57,039
detailed information about the practices

157
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,360
people are using isn't helpful to see

158
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:04,178
how the variety does overall you know it

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,019
becomes too specific to be useful so we

160
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:11,408
focus on these very limited ratings and

161
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:14,139
date you it's just for the glowing you

162
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:16,598
just if stars and in the review you have

163
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,449
a lot of space here you can elaborate on

164
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:21,368
how you're caring for me whatever you

165
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,649
want to go into you you know are you

166
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:26,709
using conventional practices organic

167
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,449
resin integrated pest management you

168
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,519
have ready says you're growing them in

169
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,250
container all of those details you can

170
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,259
put in your review as a way to help

171
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,568
people who are reading your reviews I

172
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,610
know it and when you look at some of the

173
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:41,860
reviews and Yelp am and they have like

174
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,149
got novels in there this is real freedom

175
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:48,579
retinol and you can also upload a

176
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:51,058
picture I'm going to try to upload one

177
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:56,199
you'll get this little separate box and

178
00:08:51,058 --> 00:09:00,069
then you choose a file and I perfectly

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:04,600
to file rabid image that would work and

180
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:06,820
so if you get an error usually that the

181
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,850
image is too big and you have to open

182
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,710
the photo in and some Photoshop thing

183
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,659
and make it small but I see if you don't

184
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,480
get this thing that says whatever your

185
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:22,240
image is call has been uploaded then

186
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,310
your image is too big so I'm going to

187
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,480
close that and then my image in there

188
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,329
because I'm going to do likely to

189
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,450
symptoms symptoms I know it was going to

190
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,430
fit and I can always remove my image so

191
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,009
if you want to add a photo give that a

192
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:41,769
try if you upload one and it doesn't

193
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,139
work and then you can see keep making it

194
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:47,199
smaller it still doesn't work just save

195
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:50,049
and then get out as a whole program and

196
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,009
then go back in and you can see under

197
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:56,409
manage my reviews I can add I can always

198
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,720
go in and edit my reviews so for example

199
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:03,279
if I grow provider bushings again this

200
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,560
year I can edit my review of provider

201
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,250
voicings because I've grown in this year

202
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,639
and maybe have a different different

203
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,519
overall review of them and then I had

204
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,539
when I started and so I think part of

205
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,679
the problem here is here's the AMA

206
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,349
administrator so they're not quite

207
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,919
seeing what you see when you can edit a

208
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,870
review but you can just click on manage

209
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,839
my reviews manage my profiles once

210
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,419
you're in there I'm going to go over to

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,509
one more thing these top rated varieties

212
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:40,419
show how long how many people have rated

213
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:43,720
those reviews and the most reviews not

214
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:47,529
surprising we have 101 reviews of fungal

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,990
but be fabulous if we had hundreds of

216
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:53,350
reviews of all of the varieties that

217
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:58,629
really informs our selected list of

218
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:01,990
variety we also go back to the special

219
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:04,750
variety trial site if you haven't been

220
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,049
there to go there you'll see that we

221
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,460
have ma Fiona has uploaded much of the

222
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:11,159
mask you

223
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,950
for this project there one of the things

224
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,860
she did not upload it was the signage

225
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:19,320
you can use in the trial learn fast

226
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,740
timing is available through the Cornell

227
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,600
box folder which at least one person in

228
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,200
each County typically the county

229
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,430
educator have access to class counts

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,200
which you can download those signs and

231
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:41,789
manipulate them locally to suit your

232
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:43,830
needs and print them for yourself kind

233
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:47,250
of counting as a question how often do

234
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,730
you watch the reviewing so so how often

235
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:54,450
do I want to we want the ratings you

236
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:59,039
because of human rating if you I would

237
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:02,940
say you go in there anytime and put in a

238
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,240
rating for example uh I think I would be

239
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,270
able to learn I had something to say so

240
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,740
here on provider we see oh I found out

241
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:15,120
that this being is not it's not um

242
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,360
terminating well or I'm finding that

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,720
stealing are dying so I'm not having

244
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,149
much success rate with seedlings I might

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,730
go in there and just start the providers

246
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:29,699
machine review because I can always go

247
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,310
in there later at harvest or some other

248
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,259
juncture is not an add to the review

249
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,629
saying oh actually they even though they

250
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,509
are slow to get started in the end they

251
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:42,208
they did quite well so you can keep

252
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,220
adding here you at the very least I

253
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:47,729
would hope that you could go in there at

254
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,278
harvest and provide that review so

255
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,329
however it works best for you in place

256
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:56,879
you might find of just taking this

257
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:59,789
review you know the things that you have

258
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,220
to provide isn't it maybe you do a paper

259
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:04,439
version that several people maybe

260
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,410
contribute to and then one person goes

261
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,750
in and write the review so maybe use a

262
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:12,299
intermediate paper version is helpful

263
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,169
and this happens one person go in and

264
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:19,799
write the review at some point and then

265
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:22,110
our hope is that that you you once you

266
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,049
have your profile in there

267
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,259
from your County you will continue to

268
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:30,870
add to that so on - counties look at

269
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,210
them like superstars let's see can any

270
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:38,220
of you be an icon and they are reviewed

271
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:41,430
42 variety so this would be fabulous if

272
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,860
each county has 42 varieties 50 counties

273
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:46,229
have 42 varieties in there you really

274
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,149
would be the ones who are helping us

275
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,879
establish that list of recommended

276
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,889
variety and that's what we need you need

277
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,389
your help to do that because our

278
00:13:52,889 --> 00:14:01,049
researchers no longer have interest nor

279
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:03,389
funding to review varieties how the

280
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,639
performance of varieties a length of

281
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:07,949
breeding varieties for specific purpose

282
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,769
and then the plant breeders might break

283
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,370
on the varieties that they're trying to

284
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,259
develop so fishing serves tiny faculties

285
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,090
in the area not a user name which would

286
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,740
you try again and is packed

287
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,379
should we keep using that or should I

288
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,950
create one Mississippi and Kentucky

289
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,509
Oh excellent question oh I think I'm

290
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,680
going to go back to you Patti

291
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:35,819
um I think you can go in there and even

292
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:38,489
change your name in my profile I can

293
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:48,090
actually change my name

294
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:51,090
for Lori - LJ b77 and then I think I can

295
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,220
update that so if you can get in if you

296
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,769
remember your the hard part is

297
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,240
remembering hello if you can get in

298
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:02,549
there once I think um you can change

299
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,490
your name the - thank you I've changed

300
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:09,750
my name there so go in and change your

301
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,940
name so here I'm hoping about password

302
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,850
recovery work so the main part is is

303
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,790
trying to remember which email do you if

304
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,649
you forgot your password but you can go

305
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:22,860
to recover your password

306
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,600
Venice's your email that you use and and

307
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,460
then it will sense that account and

308
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,940
hopefully still active account so the

309
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,830
only problem we've run into is if people

310
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,310
use them email that they didn't use they

311
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,649
don't no longer you

312
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:39,099
we can't recover your password for you

313
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,828
you don't have access to passwords so

314
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,720
hopefully email address recover your

315
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:45,489
account and then change the name to

316
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,199
whatever you think is appropriate and

317
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:53,049
it's okay to use the same uh I feel like

318
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:57,399
if you had variety trials in your

319
00:15:53,049 --> 00:16:00,240
general vicinity previously to use that

320
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,068
same account would be appropriate even

321
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,589
if it's not that precisely the exact

322
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:08,799
same location but it's pretty pretty

323
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:13,779
similar because we're not really that

324
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:17,938
fine fine details here if you have any

325
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:21,999
trouble trying to get information in and

326
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:25,828
just shoot me an O or or Fiona and

327
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:28,689
children straight as you can

328
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:30,818
well we'll set you up because this

329
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:34,659
federal variety trial garden is is

330
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:36,878
really extremely important that you

331
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:41,649
provide us with this information so in

332
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:44,170
turn when we go when Gardner comes here

333
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:47,230
and it's nice to have more than six

334
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,479
rating about something oh look at this

335
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:53,558
one this rating Uncle Tom a actually

336
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,129
it's successfully uploaded a picture on

337
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:58,750
goal and so when pictures are uploaded

338
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,610
we actually is more than one picture was

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,350
uploaded it will show up multiple

340
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,709
pictures will show up across there and

341
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,980
you can see would be nicest this is all

342
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,409
just loaded up with reviews from New

343
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,740
York other states also like to provide

344
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:16,659
reviews both we care mostly about you so

345
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,279
I think this is a pretty exciting tool

346
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:21,870
oh let me show you a few other things

347
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:24,490
about this tool if you are logged in

348
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,678
while we're here and you're not seeing a

349
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,429
question so I love this so I'm it I

350
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:34,030
could be here for a while um we should

351
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:38,649
you put other things like I log back in

352
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:42,009
to do them all right when I'm one point

353
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:46,719
as long business balance account I can

354
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:51,119
um filter my reviews by my state

355
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:55,179
my free zone or my soil texture uh so

356
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,918
let's do my drop free zone so I have to

357
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,960
tell you about the cross free when

358
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,000
you're in the setting up your profile

359
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,169
and there's a link to like the back

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,029
cross free map

361
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,950
really is broken we have to fix it but

362
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,210
again I told you that's hard to get

363
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,690
things fixed when we don't have a

364
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,390
programmer but there was that oh now I'm

365
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,390
seeing the variety based by only

366
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,000
varieties that are reviewed and in my

367
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:23,470
frost free zone so I can limit my search

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,400
that way and and then if I typed in

369
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,829
something like some ID or crop it would

370
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,190
limit it even further and then I can

371
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:35,408
also limit it to my from pre-season I

372
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,250
mean that will get me people outside my

373
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:41,860
face but if I just do my my face and

374
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,829
this is the way I go in when I'm

375
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:47,439
updating that variety list as I limited

376
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:50,710
to see New York State and then I look at

377
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,190
the what's been rated in New York State

378
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,610
and how many reviews so then I can order

379
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:02,730
it also by by not the highest overall

380
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:09,399
rating I can do it by most reviews and

381
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:13,029
my state you can get this to search so

382
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,919
now I know um my life State and the most

383
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,619
number of reviews oh look at rest the

384
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,419
existence house of Olympus because even

385
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:22,178
haven't you grow it for a long time now

386
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,860
so there are are 21 reviews just from

387
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,288
New York State and we should be

388
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:30,219
tightening maybe three times four times

389
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:33,429
many 100 reviews so we're encouraging

390
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,558
you to follow through to the end and put

391
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,300
in the review of things that you've

392
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:40,000
grown

393
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:45,779
this has been a production of Cornell

394
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,779
