1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,320
and welcome everybody to the uh fall

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,279
2020

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
seminar series online this is really

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,640
exciting i'm

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,800
particularly excited for our seminar

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,560
speaker to kick off with apples as we

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,080
get into the apple harvest and

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,479
um today's seminar speaker is sean miles

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,000
from

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,280
dalhousie university in nova scotia

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
i first learned about sean from his

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
research

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,359
in apple genetics and while i was

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
working on the horticultural side he's

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,000
been working a lot on the genetic side

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,558
we had a lot of

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
overlapping interests and that really

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,878
became

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,079
apparent in our conversation just before

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,920
this seminar today but uh in doing a

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,359
little bit of research on sean

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,359
it's pretty interesting and it's always

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,439
really fascinating to learn about

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
people's academic histories and

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,158
really uh sean's training was in human

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
genetics and he was studying

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,439
the populations of different

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
people around the world he was working

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,478
at the max planck

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,840
institute in germany and actually

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,920
was working on some of the earliest

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
sequencing fast sequencing machines and

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
being able to

36
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:29,839
process through many samples and doing

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,040
things like um snip

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
arrays for for humans to understand how

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
different populates and people moved

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
around the world and then got

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
into grapes basically because he fell in

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
love with a winemaker

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
and figured that if they're gonna find a

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,199
place to live together

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
um he better figure out something that

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,759
he can do where

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
she's gonna be based because grapes can

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
only be grown in so many locations

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,478
throughout the world

50
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,118
and got into apples later in his

51
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,239
um academic interests so really

52
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,438
fascinating and

53
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,560
deep um research history that that sean

54
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,000
has

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
as we do for all of our seminar speakers

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
one interesting fact and even though all

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,878
of these things i mentioned already were

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
quite interesting

59
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,919
i asked sean if there was something he'd

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
like to share and so

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,159
the interesting and and not well-known

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,680
fact about sean miles is that he can tap

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,079
dance

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
and so um you can think about him tap

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
dancing

66
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,840
while he does his seminar today so i'll

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,919
pass it off to sean at this point

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,039
again if anybody has questions for sean

69
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,559
during the seminar

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,079
feel free to put them in the chat and

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,080
we'll address them during the q

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,400
a period great thanks greg

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,560
i'm just uh if anyone has any problems

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
uh hearing me then they can put

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
something into the chat there to let

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
them know and thanks for the

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,959
introduction i was just thinking you

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
know what it actually would make the

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
seminar a lot more interesting if i was

80
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,799
tap dancing

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
uh while doing a talk about uh genetics

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,439
uh but

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
uh but i would need a little more

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,000
practice i think so i didn't really

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
quite uh

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
plan on that but i'll keep it in mind

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,480
for next time so i'll expect another

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,400
invitation

89
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,000
thanks for having me this is uh this is

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
really great and i wanted to mention too

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,039
uh i'm going to share my screen here i

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
think right

93
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,479
i think this is how this works so that

94
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,318
if i pop this

95
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,318
up i believe everybody should be able to

96
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,719
see that great

97
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,079
um so i did want to mention uh you know

98
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,598
you talked about this uh

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,920
sort of uh circuitous route towards uh

100
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,679
agriculture and and it's worth since

101
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,158
there are many students uh listening in

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
i hope

103
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,479
uh that uh you know uh often it's a

104
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,238
little bit daunting when

105
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,238
uh showing up somewhere and getting into

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,759
something new uh and when you're getting

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
into a new subject area

108
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,280
and i wanna assure you you know i

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
started i did my undergraduate degree

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
with a major in english literature

111
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,799
and uh my master's in phd in human

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,480
genetics and didn't start looking at

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
plants until my post-doc

114
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,759
and so um you know

115
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,878
these sorts of uh circuitous routes can

116
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,518
happen in life and

117
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,959
there's lots of chance meetings along

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
the way and if you put your head down

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
and focus on doing good science and

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,239
doing good work

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,438
then lots of things are possible and so

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,080
i thought i'd mention that because i

123
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,719
know that

124
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
often in fact every time i took a new

125
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,000
position

126
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
somewhere uh at each institution that i

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,120
went to

128
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
i would feel completely overwhelmed when

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,959
i first got there like i did

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
during my postdoc at cornell i arrived

131
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,399
in ed buckler's lab

132
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,399
who was talking a million miles a minute

133
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,319
about corn and i knew nothing

134
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,399
about anything anyone was talking about

135
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,159
in lab meetings as a postdoc

136
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,079
you know you kind of feel like you might

137
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
you should probably know something

138
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,240
uh so that feeling of being overwhelmed

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
and being stressed out and like feeling

140
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
like

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
you're an imposter and you're in the

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,600
wrong place i i can assure you that

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
it does uh subside with the years and

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
that uh

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
that's my little piece of advice for all

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the students getting in and shuffling

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
around into their different uh

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
departments and different endeavors

149
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,599
along their career paths so

150
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
uh thank you very much for having me the

151
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,439
first thing i'd like to start with is

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
that

153
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,680
to show you where i am uh so i'm in nova

154
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,120
scotia canada

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
up here in the uh sort of northeast of

156
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
uh of the north american continent uh

157
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
out on that little peninsula

158
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
and it's a beautiful place to be and i

159
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,800
thought i'd just describe a little bit

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
where i am here this is nova scotia

161
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,319
there's nothing of the us on here maine

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,120
is just the west of new brunswick here

163
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,599
but we are in i'm located in the

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,759
annapolis valley i work for

165
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,439
dalhousie university but i actually work

166
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
out of a federal research station

167
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
so it's kind of like cornell professors

168
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,519
who are co-located up in geneva new york

169
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,879
uh i actually work out of a federal

170
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
research station here

171
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,038
in kentville nova scotia up here in what

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
we call the annapolis valley in the

173
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,199
annapolis valley

174
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,439
uh contains about we grow about 10 of

175
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,478
the of canada's apple production

176
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,800
um so it's a very small area but it's

177
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,560
sizeable uh in terms of its contribution

178
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
to apples and canada

179
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
and there's only about a million people

180
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,119
who live in nova scotia overall so it's

181
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
mostly rural

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,720
and the the main city is halifax we

183
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
grow in our little valley here grow

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
almost uh you know

185
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,679
the majority of the food grown in nova

186
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
scotia

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
especially all the fruit crops so we

188
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
grow apples and and

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
pears and plums and peaches and more and

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
more grapes there's a

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,519
growing wine industry so it's not unlike

192
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
upstate new york

193
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,198
uh in uh in its growing conditions and

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,079
this in the sorts of things that we're

195
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,079
growing

196
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,519
and it's a beautiful place to visit and

197
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,719
when all this coveted stuff is over

198
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,359
you're more than welcome to come and

199
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,600
have a

200
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
have a glance i do we don't often get

201
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
visitors coming up to talk about science

202
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
so it's a real pleasure if you do

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
so if you were ever thinking of having a

204
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
visit up to the east coast of canada

205
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,400
please do get in touch and i'd be happy

206
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
to show you around

207
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,399
um and it's a beautiful place to come

208
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,439
and eat apples and drink cider too of

209
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,478
course

210
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,918
um so i did want to mention you know

211
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,399
during my postdoc

212
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,159
when i was at cornell there was a real

213
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,638
interest in

214
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,479
in these in using modern genomics

215
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
technologies and the emerging genomic

216
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,120
technologies to

217
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,720
to characterize the usda's gene banks or

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,000
germplasm collections

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,560
and my postdoc project under uh the

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,439
supervision of ed buckler was to uh

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
characterize

222
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,879
develop a snip array and characterize

223
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,038
the uh

224
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,360
the usda grape germplasm collection in

225
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,719
collaboration with the usda researchers

226
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
up in

227
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
geneva new york and also part of the

228
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,160
collection is down in davis california

229
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
and it was a wonderful opportunity i

230
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
felt really fortunate to be able to do

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
that work

232
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,120
and i've moved on now started a position

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,160
up here in canada

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,598
and in our experience

235
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
dealing with the usda germplasm

236
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,878
collection of course is that it was not

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,439
planted for the purposes of doing

238
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,680
genetic

239
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,439
mapping work necessarily it's planted as

240
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
a gene bank in order to preserve and

241
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,560
maintain diversity

242
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,159
of course that often means that the

243
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
plants are planted at different times

244
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
perhaps on different root stocks

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
maintained by different people and the

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
data is collected

247
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,759
at different times of the year and in a

248
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,439
different way than you might want to

249
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,038
collect the data for the purposes of

250
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,439
genetic mapping

251
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,038
and so when i started my position here

252
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,560
in canada

253
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,959
i made a special request to the usda to

254
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
that was accepted fortunately to

255
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,359
actually

256
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
make a copy essentially of the usda

257
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,038
apple germplasm collection up in nova

258
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
scotia which we now call canada's apple

259
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,639
biodiversity collection

260
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
it contains as many of the malice

261
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,479
domesticasts of the domesticated apple

262
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,079
and its wild primary wild ancestor

263
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,639
malice of versi

264
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,560
and so we didn't take all the other wild

265
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,080
species and incorporate it in here

266
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,919
because the purpose of this map this

267
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,278
population was really to

268
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,958
plant it out specifically for the

269
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,278
purposes of genetic mapping and doing

270
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,479
genome-wide association studies

271
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:57,439
so we planted this out uh each of these

272
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,399
uh varieties out in duplicate well we

273
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,440
grafted them all to m9 rootstock in 2011

274
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,240
and then in 2013 we planted it we ended

275
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,320
up with 1113 different accessions

276
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
planted in duplicate with czech

277
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
varieties

278
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
that are planted throughout so that you

279
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,519
can control for the spatial

280
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
effects in the orchard and so in total

281
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,679
it's 2

282
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,600
354 trees and that's uh

283
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,039
that includes a lot of that most of that

284
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
material is from the usda but there's

285
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,000
also advanced breeding lines from

286
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,278
canada's apple breeding program and some

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,039
other stuff we had hanging around in

288
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,439
nova scotia that we threw in there

289
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,958
so uh if you're ever interested in

290
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
seeing this so what we've been doing to

291
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,679
give you an idea

292
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
i'm not going to talk about this

293
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,958
collection today this is really the

294
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
genetic mapping work i'm going to talk

295
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,599
more about the evolutionary work that

296
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
we've done based on the usda collection

297
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
but what we've really focused on here in

298
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,679
nova scotia with this

299
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,879
apple biodiversity collection is to try

300
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,079
to get as much

301
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,799
phenotype data as we can on a budget

302
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
of course and it's very time consuming

303
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,159
and expensive to do as many of you are

304
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,119
aware to collect traits across an

305
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,799
orchard like this

306
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
and so we've made use of barcode

307
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,319
scanners where we can

308
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
to speed that up and it's a herculean

309
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
effort really to do over a thousand

310
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,120
varieties and harvest them all at the

311
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,159
right times too

312
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,959
because they're all developing at

313
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,559
different rates and put them through

314
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,399
you know and collect the data that you'd

315
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,439
like so i made a little video here and

316
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
i'm hoping this is going to work and

317
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
we'll see

318
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
but this is one of the devices we use

319
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
called the pimpernell

320
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,679
that does automated uh weighing of every

321
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
apple

322
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,879
and then the so the first step is the

323
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
weight

324
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,320
weighing right there and then the next

325
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
step it goes up into a penetrometer

326
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
there's an automated penetrometer that

327
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,278
will take a firmness measure then it

328
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,600
shoots that apple into a chute

329
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,879
that then gets squished and the apple

330
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,240
gets squished up and it does

331
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:50,399
automatically it takes the uh the

332
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,839
um the acidity and the soluble solids

333
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,519
and so you get that automatically

334
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
directly into the spreadsheet no writing

335
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,799
down data and copying it back into excel

336
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
files and so on

337
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,000
uh and we made that trying to find ways

338
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,639
of making that

339
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
data uh acquisition process as efficient

340
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,519
as possible

341
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
and one of the other little devices is

342
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,759
pretty nifty because we want to get

343
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,679
color

344
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,879
and shape we take a picture of all the

345
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,639
apples going through

346
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,559
we you call this little device the

347
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,759
snapple because it takes snapshots of

348
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,000
every apple

349
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,439
uh and you go and uh put the apple in

350
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
and it takes a snapshot and

351
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
links it to the id and it goes right up

352
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,480
into a a little uh

353
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,759
drive there we put this together with

354
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,360
some engineering students at the

355
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,039
university

356
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
and so that's sped things up and we've

357
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,958
we've got a decent data set from our

358
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
apple biodiversity collection since many

359
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,319
of those are actually

360
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,159
apples that are found at the usda

361
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
collection in geneva

362
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,958
that the data set that we will will come

363
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
to publish here shortly will be

364
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,000
you know it'll be publicly available and

365
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,759
available to anyone who's

366
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,078
also studying these apples in geneva new

367
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,519
york so i encourage anybody

368
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,559
who is doing work in apples and is

369
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
looking for

370
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,919
sort of a comprehensive evaluation of

371
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,599
phenotype data that they might

372
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,759
like to link to the data that they've

373
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
got and the genotype data is going to be

374
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,639
all available as well

375
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
i think we've got about quarter million

376
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
markers now genotyped in the entire

377
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,839
collection so if you'd

378
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,879
um we're really keen to know of other

379
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,959
people who are doing

380
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,480
uh this kind of work on those same

381
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,000
varieties and since they're genetically

382
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,879
identical but just planted in different

383
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
spots

384
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,399
if you're up in the geneva collection

385
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,839
doing something interesting then uh

386
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
feel free to reach out and we're happy

387
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,240
to come up with a way

388
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of of helping out your study and perhaps

389
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,120
adding some data to it that will be

390
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,759
uh useful to you okay

391
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
so today i'm going to talk about some

392
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,639
data that we've collected on the usda

393
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
collection which is

394
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,680
far overdue to be published but uh it

395
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,599
should come out

396
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,278
relatively soon this is work that was

397
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
led by two postdocs in my lab zoe

398
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,879
mijikovsky and kyle gardner

399
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,278
and some help from a phd student sophie

400
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,639
watts and my main collaborator june song

401
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,000
from agriculture in agri-food canada

402
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,759
here who helped out

403
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
and this was a project that was led in

404
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,439
collaboration with the usda

405
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,399
uh led by gangnam song in geneva

406
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,160
so the usda apple germplasm collection

407
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,078
is is fantastic it's really

408
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:10,639
a real showcase uh germ uh

409
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,759
gene bank from the usda in terms of its

410
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,159
breadth and depth

411
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,278
uh certainly the number of countries

412
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,360
represented in terms of

413
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,399
where these apples are coming from is

414
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,519
enormous

415
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
you can see a lot of them are from the

416
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,639
united states 228

417
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,799
uh but you know there's a hundred

418
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,639
varieties from the united kingdom and a

419
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,120
good representation from central asia

420
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,919
which is

421
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,839
sort of the the original home of the the

422
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,039
apple so where it originated so

423
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,240
those progenitor apples and so this

424
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,240
gives you an idea of the

425
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
of the breadth of that collection and

426
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,759
what we did uh

427
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,040
is we collected genotyping by sequencing

428
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,639
data i'm going to talk about some

429
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,078
genetic data that we collected from this

430
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
entire collection

431
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,120
we ran 42 lanes of illumina high seeks

432
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,399
so generated

433
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
7.8 uh 7.9 billion hundred base pair

434
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,078
reads

435
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,039
from 1949 accessions from that

436
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,319
collection

437
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,319
so i'm not going to talk today about

438
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,519
what we did with the other uh

439
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,240
members of the malice species uh that

440
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
are that have not really contributed or

441
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,198
contributed only

442
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,120
um recently really to apple breeding and

443
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,838
apple development to modern cultivars

444
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,879
i'm focusing mainly today uh exclusively

445
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,839
today on the

446
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,759
variety on the species thought to have

447
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,839
contributed to

448
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,519
modern day apples so

449
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,279
we've used these data already actually

450
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,959
in a previous publication to do

451
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,639
a genome-wide association study to

452
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,198
perform some genetic mapping

453
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
where we take the data from usda grin

454
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,399
database

455
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,720
and so we didn't collect any phenotype

456
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,480
data ourselves we just used existing

457
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,680
historical phenotype data from the

458
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,959
database

459
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,719
and linked it to the uh the gbs data the

460
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,958
genotyping by sequencing data

461
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
and that resulted in about at that time

462
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,559
when we were

463
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
doing fairly simple bioinformatics with

464
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,559
these data

465
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
we had 8 000 snips or single nucleotide

466
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,078
polymorphisms these are the markers that

467
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,320
we get from the sequence data

468
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,319
so we only ended up with 8 000 snips and

469
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,879
some very messy phenotype data i must

470
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
admit

471
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,639
from the usda grid database often things

472
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
are scored as

473
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,759
you know the apple is either soft or

474
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,639
it's hard but not

475
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,078
a quantification of the actual firmness

476
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,320
of the apple for instance

477
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,479
or the apple is either early or it's

478
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
late but not the actual date it was

479
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
harvested on

480
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
and so on but despite that you know even

481
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
with uh

482
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,319
some relatively noisy phenotype data you

483
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,159
can

484
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
you can catch the lowest hanging fruit

485
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,600
and we did in that publication

486
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,039
uh demonstrate that we identified the

487
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
main locus underlying

488
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,599
firmness that we've done some subsequent

489
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
work on and believe that it is a

490
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
very important for ripening apple

491
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,920
ripening so

492
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
i'm not going to talk about that work

493
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,439
today but i do want to point out that

494
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
it's really great using these genotyping

495
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
by sequencing data

496
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,000
you know or any of this next generation

497
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,199
dna sequence data compared to

498
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,278
microarrays

499
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,240
when you're using a microarray you you

500
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,600
run it once and

501
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
and the data you've got is what you've

502
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
got but it turns out with sequence data

503
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,919
there's always a new algorithm coming

504
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,919
out you know

505
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,078
every year to be able to point at your

506
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,278
original sequence data to extract more

507
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,679
of that data and so you can ex we point

508
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,198
to

509
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,198
we've developed we spent a couple of

510
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,319
years developing imputation algorithms

511
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,639
and genotype calling

512
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
algorithms that would be more suitable

513
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,440
for

514
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
non-model organisms like the apple that

515
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,320
have a poor

516
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
relatively poor reference genome where

517
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,199
the order of the markers can't be

518
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,039
is not always really reliable where you

519
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,719
can't really phase haplotypes because of

520
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,439
rapid linkage equilibrium

521
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,240
decay and where the the existing genome

522
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,399
sequences are kind of a poor quality

523
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
um and and they're highly highly

524
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,159
heterozygous

525
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
so they're uh those present some

526
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,278
challenges for genotype calling and

527
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,759
generating a really good

528
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,439
genetic data set and so uh we worked

529
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,879
quite hard on this and developed

530
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
our last our most recent imputation

531
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,559
algorithm link computer

532
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,240
um and with lane computer we've we've

533
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,599
actually managed to generate a lot more

534
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,000
snips in the present

535
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
presentation that i'm doing today uh and

536
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the paper that we've got submitted

537
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,519
we've got about 20 to 30 000 snips so

538
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,279
you more than double the number of snips

539
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,199
you got from your first try

540
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,879
but since then we've actually tweaked

541
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
things a little bit and we're up over

542
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
200 000 snips now

543
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,558
with the exact same data that we used to

544
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,038
only get 8 000 snips from

545
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,678
so again with microarrays you get what

546
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,679
you get

547
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,160
but with the sequence data there are

548
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
ways of using that missing data that's

549
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
in there

550
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
using patterns from the existing data to

551
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,839
fill in missing data quite a bit better

552
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,918
we find and that's been a real uh real

553
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,918
benefit to us

554
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,520
so uh just keep that in mind in that

555
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,280
link computer algorithm for people who

556
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,960
are working on non-model organisms and

557
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,639
collecting genetic data and they wish to

558
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
fill in their missing data link computer

559
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
is great because it

560
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,359
it allows you to say for example you

561
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,079
know i'm okay with a 10

562
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,839
genotyping error rate if i can get a

563
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,918
quarter million snips

564
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,879
or you can say no no i want really high

565
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
quality i only want

566
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
one percent error rate well then you

567
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,320
might only get 25 000 snips

568
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
and it allows the user to decide what

569
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,079
error rate they wish to accept

570
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
and therefore how many markers you're

571
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,038
willing to get so if you're on a fishing

572
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
expedition and you're doing some genetic

573
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,160
mapping

574
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,038
uh you may want to make it uh pretty

575
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
loose and have

576
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,400
large numbers of markers with you know

577
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
quite a bit of error

578
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,038
because you can always go back to the

579
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,038
markers that are associated and go check

580
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,319
to see whether they're real

581
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,160
on the other hand if you're doing some

582
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,639
kind of population genetic analysis and

583
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
you want

584
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
reliable marker data you may want to be

585
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,119
more strict so it allows the user to

586
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,120
decide that

587
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
okay so i'm just going to get into some

588
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,839
of the questions that we wish to answer

589
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
with these genetic data and it's well

590
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,678
known from several publications and from

591
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,359
lots of work that's even been done on

592
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,480
the on the phenotype level

593
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:48,079
uh and just traditional botany that the

594
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,599
the primary progenitor of the uh modern

595
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,558
apple that you would see in the grocery

596
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,000
store

597
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,240
is comes from a species called

598
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
malaceversii which is

599
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,679
uh still found in the forests of

600
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
kazakhstan and the tianshen mountains

601
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
along the

602
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,798
uh very close to the border of china and

603
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
so here you see malice version here

604
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,558
printed in

605
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,519
right in the middle of uh kazakhstan and

606
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,558
that this

607
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:14,160
it's believed that this male then

608
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:17,440
as humans moved along with humans

609
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,360
uh over to europe and

610
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,279
there it um had some introgression from

611
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,119
malice silvestris which is another

612
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,519
malice species it's a wild european crab

613
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,879
apple

614
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,720
very small astringent and bitter and

615
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,919
the degree of that integration is still

616
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
under debate and

617
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,720
there's been some conflicting findings

618
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,159
in the literature so one of the things

619
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,519
that we can do with our data since we

620
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,720
have some malice silvestris in the

621
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,119
collection and some malice of

622
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,319
ci and lots of modern apples we can ask

623
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,239
ourselves the question of

624
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,839
what do uh what do the relationships

625
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,038
look like between

626
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,879
these various species so

627
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,679
here are the sample sizes across the top

628
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,840
for this particular analysis is 749

629
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
malice domestica so those are the what

630
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,558
you would consider

631
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
uh dessert apples and cider apples

632
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,918
modern varieties and so on

633
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,440
uh 115 malic civersii those are from

634
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,720
kazakhstan

635
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,600
and 11 malicious from europe

636
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,200
and those so you can see if we run a

637
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,599
principal components analysis if we take

638
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,159
those

639
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,678
20 to 30 000 snips and we plug them into

640
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
principal components what principle

641
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,480
components

642
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,480
allows us to do is visualize the

643
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,200
relationships among all the individuals

644
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,839
in two dimensions you have 20 to 30 000

645
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
snips

646
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,359
and you want to visualize how everyone

647
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
is related

648
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,079
essentially pc1 here is like shooting a

649
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,519
regression line through a 20 to 30 000

650
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,399
dimensional space

651
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,158
and uh and then pc2 is then an another

652
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
orthogonal kind of regression line

653
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,880
through that space

654
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,720
and so it's capturing as much of the

655
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,000
variation in the data as you can and you

656
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,240
can see pc one

657
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,759
accounts for about six six and a half

658
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
percent of the data six point seven four

659
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,960
percent of the data

660
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
so what you're looking at here gives you

661
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,240
a visualization of the relationships

662
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
among individuals and what you see

663
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,519
the squares on the right hand side of

664
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,359
the plot those are all malice

665
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,440
sylvester's those are the european wild

666
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,719
crab apple on the right hand side

667
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,558
you can see that there's two groups of

668
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,558
them and in fact the one in the top

669
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,279
they're from germany and the one down

670
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,480
below or from further in eastern europe

671
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,319
so there's a little bit of structure

672
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,960
within the population but we're really

673
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,960
just concerned with pc1 here and how

674
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,558
very easily the genetic data separate

675
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
those malice sylvester samples

676
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,200
represented by the squares on the right

677
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,519
with the triangles on the left hand side

678
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
which belong to malice civersia

679
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,519
so it's very easy with these genetic

680
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,080
data to pull these two two species apart

681
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,279
now if we want to know where the malice

682
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,639
domestica lie

683
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,720
and how they're related to these two

684
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
groups then what we do is we

685
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,558
project those malice domestica onto

686
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,479
these axes

687
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,918
and there's a there's a way of doing

688
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
this uh using standard

689
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
principal components analysis to project

690
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,880
those samples on

691
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,399
i've colored those dots either they're

692
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
gray if we don't know exactly what

693
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
they're used for

694
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,798
or if they're cider apples they're in

695
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,720
orange

696
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,400
and if they're dessert mainly what we

697
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,679
call dessert apples or the ones

698
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,759
eating apples the ones you find in the

699
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
grocery store or other some of them are

700
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,158
labeled as cooking in grin

701
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,678
but they're essentially not cider apples

702
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,760
they're in blue

703
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
so you can see that but basically you

704
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,879
form a cloud

705
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,600
right in the middle right between malice

706
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
version silvestris about 50 50. so

707
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,519
the conclusion there would be that they

708
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,200
share about half their ancestry from the

709
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,879
original ancestor melissa versailles

710
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
about half from al-silvestris

711
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
however i'd be cautious about putting

712
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,239
too much into that interpretation giving

713
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,080
the number of markers we have

714
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,519
and the number of malicious samples we

715
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,960
have which is only 11.

716
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,558
and there are some more studies coming

717
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,919
out that we know of here in the near

718
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,440
future that are doing whole genome

719
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,120
sequencing which will be able to better

720
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,919
answer those questions

721
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,439
um but despite that one of the most one

722
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,159
of the most interesting things here

723
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
is that those two clouds of orange and

724
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,320
blue dots don't actually

725
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,440
line up completely the orange dots tend

726
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,678
to be pulled over

727
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
further to the right and the blue dots

728
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
further to the left and that's

729
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,038
demonstrated here in panel b

730
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,640
where if you look at the pc-1 values of

731
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,319
cider apples

732
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
you can see that they are significantly

733
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,720
greater than the the

734
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,839
pc-1 values of the other or desert

735
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,319
apples

736
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,918
and so it appears from our analysis that

737
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,599
regardless of what the proportions are

738
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,480
of the ancestry between sylvesterous and

739
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,759
cervici

740
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,839
that cider apples tend to they appeared

741
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,839
to derive more of their ancestry from

742
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,480
malice silvestris the european crab

743
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,599
apple

744
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,319
than do uh dessert apples and this makes

745
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,759
good sense

746
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,439
uh in a way because the malice of estrus

747
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,440
apples are known to be

748
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,519
very astringent and bitter and have a

749
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,360
lot of tannin and are acidic

750
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,519
and share some of those characteristics

751
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,000
that cider apples

752
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,839
that are desirable in cider apples and

753
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
that are less desirable in an eating

754
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,480
novel

755
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,000
and so it may be the case that some of

756
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,038
those desirable characteristics from

757
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,359
cider apples

758
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,519
are actually introduction events from uh

759
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,319
malice silvestris we weren't able really

760
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,440
to do a

761
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,879
a piece by piece genome analysis to see

762
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
where those introductions might occur

763
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
given the snip density that we have

764
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,440
but i'm sure that's coming in the future

765
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
too with future data

766
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,599
another question we can ask is what

767
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,038
regions of the genome appear to have

768
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,639
been under selection during

769
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,319
domestication so what are the

770
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,038
what are the regions of the genome that

771
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,200
really are most differentiated between

772
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,038
malice domestica or the the apples that

773
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,038
you might see on the grocery store shelf

774
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,200
versus the wild ancestors that are

775
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,798
growing in the forest of kazakhstan

776
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
and to do this what you can do is

777
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,639
calculate fst which is a measure of

778
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,319
allele frequency difference

779
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,640
between the two populations between

780
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,038
malice domestic and male subversion

781
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,038
and fst is a very simple measure if if

782
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:43,599
the allele frequency at a particular

783
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,200
snip

784
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,519
is exactly the same between the two

785
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,278
populations you get an fst of zero

786
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,798
if they are if it's a fixed difference

787
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,839
if all the domestica

788
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,558
are homozygous a a and all the at that

789
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,879
locus and

790
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,639
and all the maliceversii are homozygous

791
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
tt for the other allele then that's a

792
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
fixed difference and they'd have an fst

793
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
of one

794
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,639
you can see that there are regions of

795
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
the genome that are approaching an fst

796
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,000
of one each of the dots on this plot

797
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,519
represents one of the snips that we've

798
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,519
genotyped

799
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,918
and the horizontal red line represents

800
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,079
the five percent threshold genome-wide

801
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,840
so any dots above that line

802
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,000
are within the top five percent most

803
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,839
extreme fst values in the genome

804
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,599
and what we expect when selection

805
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,839
happens at on a particular at a

806
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
particular locus is the markers there

807
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,519
they will be they'll be driven to high

808
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,359
frequency very very quickly over time

809
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,759
and there'll be a large fst value

810
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,079
between domestica and cervici

811
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,839
so we're taking a look at all those dots

812
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,519
across the top and thinking okay are are

813
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,439
those lying in any genes that

814
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,359
are particularly important well there's

815
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
a somewhat orthogonal analysis you can

816
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,959
do here to determine whether it's really

817
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
selection or not

818
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
because you can make an fst distribution

819
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,278
from two populations when no selection

820
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
has happened

821
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:53,278
and there's still going to be five

822
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,960
percent of your markers that are going

823
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,319
to be within the top five percent

824
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,400
there's always a top five percent to

825
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,639
every distribution so we throw another

826
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,038
analysis of this called

827
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,720
xpeh so when a marker rises in frequency

828
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,759
very quickly due to selection

829
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
instead of just genetic drift then what

830
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,640
happens is

831
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,558
recombination doesn't have enough time

832
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
to go and break down

833
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,720
the haplotype that's around it and what

834
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,000
you end up with is a very long haplotype

835
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,839
that's homozygous

836
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,038
in the population and that can be

837
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,158
calculated as this statistic called

838
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,119
cross-population extended haplotype

839
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,880
homozygosity or the xpeh

840
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,399
and that's shown there on the y-axis on

841
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
this bottom panel

842
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,278
and each of the dots again here

843
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
represent one marker that we've

844
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,038
genotyped across the genome

845
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,000
and its position along that axis shows

846
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,158
whether it is

847
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,278
whether it shows extended haplotype

848
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,240
homozygosity

849
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,640
in malice domestica so here we're we're

850
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,798
uh

851
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,520
checking to see look for evidence of

852
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,319
selection within the domesticated apple

853
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,440
so dots that lie above that horizontal

854
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,639
red line

855
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,640
represent potential targets of selection

856
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
during domestication and breeding

857
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,360
now ideally in these circumstances you

858
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
see a great big peak that overlaps with

859
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,119
fst and with xphhh

860
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,038
and right underneath that peak you look

861
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,639
into the genome browser and you see

862
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,000
the name of a gene that is really

863
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
obvious and then you go and you look at

864
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,880
it in detail and

865
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,239
you characterize it in a tomato and you

866
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
throw it at nature genetics and you get

867
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
published well it doesn't turn out that

868
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,119
way for us

869
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,798
i'm afraid um with no smoking guns i

870
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,319
mean you look at the gene list and it's

871
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,319
lots of different genes

872
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,319
uh and so one of the things you can do

873
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,319
when you don't have any real

874
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,960
great candidate genes for domestication

875
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,960
between the domesticated apple and the

876
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
and its ancestor you know it's worth

877
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,480
keeping in mind that when we look at the

878
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
ancestor of the domesticated apple they

879
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
often really

880
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,558
look the same too like they look very

881
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,398
similar cevici

882
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,240
apples sometimes look like something you

883
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,079
could find in the grocery store

884
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,759
whereas another anim with in other

885
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,278
animals and other plants when you look

886
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,440
at the wild ancestor

887
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,278
and you look at the the modern cultivar

888
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,519
it's really obvious it's like oh okay

889
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,480
it's it's seed shattering or it's you

890
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,879
know ear development or it's something

891
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,399
and in apple it's really not entirely

892
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
evident what genes we would look at

893
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,678
if we were going to look at something

894
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,440
that's been under selection

895
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,880
uh so we don't have really good a priori

896
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,278
ideas about what they should be but when

897
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
we

898
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,319
so one of the things you can do you can

899
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,038
take a look at all of the snips that

900
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,879
overlap

901
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,398
within the top within the top five

902
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,600
percent for both fst

903
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,678
and xph those represent potential

904
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,359
targets of selection and you can look at

905
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,320
whether uh genes that are within a

906
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,479
certain distance i think 50 kb we chose

907
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,839
and then you can see whether those genes

908
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,159
are enriched in any particular

909
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:37,278
biological category are they involved

910
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,880
are they enriched in some uh function

911
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,640
and when we do a gene ontology

912
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,840
enrichment analysis we do find these

913
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,520
three things that are

914
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,959
enriched for these genes that have

915
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,599
appeared to have been

916
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,038
that show signatures of selection in uh

917
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,359
malice domestica

918
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,720
and that's target of rapamycin signaling

919
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,240
cellular response to phosphate

920
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,038
starvation and cellular response to

921
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,558
stress

922
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,079
it's been suggested before too in a

923
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,639
previous publication that

924
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,079
uh the the targets of selection and the

925
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,720
domesticated apple are

926
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,398
are related to adaptation to new

927
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,798
environments as they've moved

928
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,759
uh from the chenchon mountains to new

929
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:11,839
environments

930
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,960
and uh our data are consistent with that

931
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,480
hypothesis

932
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,079
but we don't have any really great

933
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,599
smoking guns and single genes that we

934
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,240
have a great story about right now in

935
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,439
terms of

936
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
domestication and apple

937
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,759
but we can do the exact same analysis

938
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,120
actually by comparing dessert apples

939
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,240
with cider apples so

940
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,678
there are 69 apples in the collection

941
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,599
for which we have genotype data and good

942
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,159
phenotype data that

943
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,678
are are characterized as cider apples

944
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
and

945
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,440
and these are so in some cases they're

946
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,720
characterized as both these are the ones

947
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,200
that are characterized as just

948
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,278
cider apples and dessert apples we have

949
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,440
288 here's a comparison

950
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,038
comparing fst between dessert and cider

951
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
apples you can see the fst values are

952
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,240
generally lower they don't go all the

953
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,079
way up to one the y axis there is only

954
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,278
going up to 0.5 so they're more closely

955
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,119
related to each other

956
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,798
than malice domestic ml cervici that

957
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:06,158
makes good sense

958
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,158
and what we see what we see here is that

959
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,839
the same kind of analysis can be done

960
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,840
but in this case we can look at

961
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,918
uh genes that appear to have been under

962
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,558
selection according to this xph

963
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
statistic

964
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,639
in dessert apples those would be found

965
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,079
above the dotted red line

966
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,120
here in the in uh below and then those

967
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,759
that are appear to

968
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,599
uh carry a signature of selection

969
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,919
insider apple so what may have been

970
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,839
uh selected for uh in cider apple

971
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,159
development and cider breeding

972
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,079
cider apple breeding and again we don't

973
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,559
find any single genes that stand out as

974
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,319
being

975
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,759
the sort of smoking gun in this analysis

976
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,519
but when we do a gene ontology

977
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,519
enrichment analysis we do find

978
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,759
that flavonoid biosynthesis genes are

979
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,278
enriched in the regions of high fst and

980
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,919
high xph

981
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,640
in the desert apples while malate

982
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,120
transport

983
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
is enriched for cider apples now we know

984
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,558
that cider apples in general are more

985
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,120
acidic and malate transport genes are

986
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,278
involved in the production of malic acid

987
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,639
so it's very possible that this is

988
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,440
something that's been selected for in

989
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,519
cider apples and flavonoid biosynthesis

990
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,080
flavonoids are

991
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,440
are are molecules that are that

992
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,720
contribute to the tannin and the

993
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,640
mouthfeel and the

994
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,640
uh and the the polyphenols in an apple

995
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,080
and the uh and a lot of the um

996
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,120
greg can help me on all this stuff i

997
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,839
think he knows a lot more about this

998
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,599
than i do

999
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,759
but uh the flavonoid biosynthesis and

1000
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,439
dessert apples one might think well

1001
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,879
i don't think you know in terms of the

1002
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,159
difference between dessert and cider

1003
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,159
apples dessert apples probably

1004
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,080
have fewer polyphenols than cider apples

1005
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,000
and it may be exactly that it may be

1006
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:44,720
that there's been active selection

1007
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,440
against polyphenols and antioxidants

1008
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,200
and in fact we have some orthogonal data

1009
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,679
here to speak to this this is

1010
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,640
uh the phenolic content in apple

1011
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,960
varieties

1012
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,880
compared to their year of release so

1013
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,038
these are all dessert apples

1014
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,559
uh that have a year of release

1015
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,519
associated with them

1016
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,798
and you can see that uh it's the only

1017
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,399
thing we've found actually that's

1018
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,158
correlated with year of release we've

1019
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,599
looked at soluble solids and size and

1020
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,120
assets and everything and the only thing

1021
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,319
that seems to be really robustly

1022
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,558
correlated with

1023
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,319
with year of release this is the year

1024
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,038
that the apple cultivar was released to

1025
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,759
the public

1026
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,599
as you know after breeding is phenolic

1027
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,158
content seems to have gone down you can

1028
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,639
see that in the year 2000 the average

1029
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,600
uh for apples that were released after

1030
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,360
the year 2000 their phenolic content is

1031
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,879
on average i think something like 30

1032
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,359
percent lower than things that were

1033
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,159
released before 1900

1034
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,719
so uh it does suggest that perhaps there

1035
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,880
has been

1036
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,000
active selection by breeders for reduced

1037
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,799
polyphenol content

1038
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,200
in dessert apples making them uh less

1039
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,960
astringent less bitter and less tannic

1040
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,399
and that kind of thing so this is worthy

1041
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,399
of future investigation

1042
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,558
but undoubtedly the strongest signature

1043
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
of selection that we find in the genome

1044
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,158
is for color

1045
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,278
so this on the top panel here you see

1046
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,080
the result of a g

1047
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,839
wasp for color with these data so in g

1048
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,158
watts we take a look at every marker and

1049
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,398
it's

1050
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,440
the strength of its correlation with a

1051
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,158
trait and in this

1052
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,000
case the apples are characterized in the

1053
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,720
usda grin database as either red or

1054
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
green

1055
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,720
or red or not red i think and so we've

1056
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,399
we've actually just done an analysis

1057
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,919
here of red versus green apples

1058
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,079
and when we compare red versus green

1059
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,200
apples and we calculate and we do a g

1060
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,199
wasp where we're looking for the

1061
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,399
correlation between each marker and that

1062
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,840
color

1063
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,079
the strength of the correlation is

1064
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,480
indicated by the height of the dot on

1065
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,278
that

1066
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,960
y-axis so that y-axis is the minus log

1067
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,558
10-p-value

1068
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,880
of the strength of the association and

1069
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,240
again that horizontal red line that you

1070
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,840
see across here

1071
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,558
that represents our significance

1072
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,240
threshold so dots that are above that

1073
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,000
uh we're going to consider significant

1074
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,679
in this analysis after correcting for

1075
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
multiple comparisons so you can see that

1076
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,399
there's

1077
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,599
one very strong peak here on chromosome

1078
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,839
9

1079
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,278
and that's unsurprising it overlaps with

1080
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,278
the red te this

1081
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,319
transposable element that we believe is

1082
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,558
responsible for the

1083
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,079
red color in apples that's been

1084
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,639
described in another manuscript

1085
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,119
here um and it sits in the middle of a

1086
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,960
mib

1087
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,639
transcription factor which is known to

1088
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,519
be involved in anthocyanin

1089
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,480
synthesis so this this makes good sense

1090
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,559
our

1091
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,079
we're picking up the locus using g wasps

1092
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,519
this isn't surprising

1093
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,359
there are some little helicopter what we

1094
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,320
call helicopter hits flying around here

1095
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,039
on the outside

1096
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,599
turns out those actually are not other

1097
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,079
loci

1098
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,919
involved in color but they're mismapped

1099
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,079
snips they actually belong on chromosome

1100
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,838
9 but the genome is often wrong and so

1101
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
you end up with these little dots around

1102
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,559
the genome and they they're just in the

1103
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,839
wrong place

1104
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,679
so we really have one single locus very

1105
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,320
strong major effect locus control in

1106
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,800
color

1107
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,359
and if we look at the xphhh again and we

1108
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,200
compare

1109
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,559
red to green apples it turns out that

1110
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,598
red apples have

1111
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,119
a very long extended haplotype around

1112
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
there and they're often homozygous for

1113
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,160
this haplotype

1114
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,320
so we see this extended haplotype

1115
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,559
homozygosity this very strong signature

1116
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,920
of selection around that nib locus

1117
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,440
suggesting that breeders over the last

1118
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,800
we can't really say how many years but

1119
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,200
certainly over the last 700 years have

1120
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,320
been

1121
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,319
selecting for redder and redder apples

1122
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,159
we can do similarly you can think of

1123
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
other phenotypes that uh

1124
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,598
that may have been desirable during

1125
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,440
apple improvement

1126
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,119
and that may have been targeted and that

1127
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,639
we may be able to find signatures for in

1128
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,599
the genome and one of those might be

1129
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,078
firmness

1130
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,240
now here we're presenting just firmness

1131
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,039
at harvest and i understand you know

1132
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,799
firmness at harvest is one thing but

1133
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,480
firmness after a few months of storage

1134
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,519
is a completely other thing so how much

1135
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,358
do you soften

1136
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,519
so i'm not looking at softening here i'm

1137
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,078
really just looking at firmness

1138
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,119
and so firmness at harvest if you run

1139
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,280
this uh

1140
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,280
in the usda grin database it's

1141
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,839
characterized as either firm or soft

1142
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,519
so we take those two and we run a gwas

1143
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,440
with our markers this is with 8 000

1144
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,320
markers in a previous publication

1145
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,599
and we find this again this is each

1146
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,440
marker and its strength of its

1147
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,960
correlation the higher on the y axis

1148
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,639
the stronger the correlation and the

1149
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,559
dotted line here is the significance

1150
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,199
threshold and we find this one hit

1151
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,279
on chromosome three and it falls within

1152
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,039
knack 18.1 and nac

1153
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
is a transcription factor that's known

1154
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,320
to be involved in the ripening process

1155
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,279
of lots of organisms in fact it's

1156
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,480
homologue in

1157
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,720
tomato is the nor gene and the nor

1158
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,800
mutant in tomato is a well-known mutant

1159
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,319
which is a knockout of the nora gene

1160
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,800
that inhibits ripening in the tomato

1161
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,480
and so and in other organisms we know

1162
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
that nack genes are involved in ripening

1163
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,519
so this is an excellent

1164
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,039
candidate gene this is this is one of

1165
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,599
these cases where we did have a smoking

1166
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,519
gun

1167
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
you know we do the analysis we find the

1168
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,400
gene it looks like knack 18.1 we've done

1169
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,240
it again

1170
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,599
many times it's been verified in other

1171
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,358
collections but certainly

1172
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,519
when we do it in our whole apple

1173
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,039
biodiversity collection with 863

1174
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,280
varieties

1175
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,519
you can see that it comes out that same

1176
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,440
snip actually comes out as the top snip

1177
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,559
you can see how much more power you have

1178
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,280
when you measure

1179
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,400
firmness here uh using a digital

1180
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
penetrometer

1181
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,800
and uh measure the actual firmness and

1182
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,880
get a quantitative measure and you have

1183
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
you know four times the sample size or

1184
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,039
twice the sample size maybe

1185
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,519
so you can see that knack really comes

1186
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,279
out very very strong here

1187
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,039
the question is does is there any

1188
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
signature of selection around that locus

1189
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,159
is there any evidence that there's been

1190
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
selection for firmness

1191
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,519
during apple improvement and the

1192
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,358
question is well

1193
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:33,440
kind of maybe so the firm versus soft

1194
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,199
apples that we do with our 20 to 30 000

1195
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,240
snips in this particular paper that i'm

1196
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,039
presenting here

1197
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,439
in this analysis we see that knack 18.1

1198
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,279
that

1199
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,800
green dot again that's the marker in the

1200
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,560
middle of knack 18.1

1201
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,720
you can see it does not go above the

1202
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,599
line and is not significant in this

1203
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,239
analysis

1204
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,359
okay despite the fact that we know now

1205
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,838
that we've done this

1206
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,039
in other populations and the the folks

1207
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,039
in denmark did it

1208
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,519
uh an analysis and they also found knack

1209
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,239
18.1 associated with it another european

1210
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,800
group has

1211
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,279
we know that that's really a snip that

1212
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,160
should be

1213
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
associated significantly with firmness

1214
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,000
but

1215
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,838
this is a good lesson for people when

1216
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,838
they're doing genetic mapping is like

1217
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,078
where did that horizontal red line come

1218
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,960
from who decided that it was going to be

1219
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,400
there

1220
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,639
the fact of the matter is is in this

1221
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,320
analysis we have 20 to 30 000 snips so

1222
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,239
when we correct for multiple comparisons

1223
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,800
that red line goes up

1224
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,679
so the the the criteria become more

1225
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,839
stringent

1226
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,960
if you have fewer markers the red line

1227
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,279
goes down

1228
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,679
but if knack 18.1 is part of the marker

1229
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,519
set in one analysis it's significant

1230
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,519
you add markers to your analysis all of

1231
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,519
a sudden it's not significant anymore

1232
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,199
so it doesn't mean significant

1233
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,039
statistical significance with these

1234
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,358
somewhat arbitrary thresholds it's very

1235
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,719
different from biological significance

1236
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,679
it's worth keeping in mind that just

1237
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,439
because knack 18 1.1 falls below the

1238
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,440
horizontal line in this analysis doesn't

1239
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,880
mean that it's not biologically relevant

1240
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,639
because we have evidence from other

1241
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,079
studies that it is

1242
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,598
so where does it fall in terms of its

1243
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,519
signature of selection in terms of its

1244
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,320
haplotype homozygosity you can see here

1245
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,440
on the bottom

1246
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,838
panel that green dot is the snip that

1247
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,639
lies within knack 18.1

1248
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,199
and it is not within the top five

1249
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,358
percent

1250
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,838
of snip's genome wide but it's within

1251
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,759
the top 5.2

1252
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,679
of snip's genome-wide so you're in one

1253
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,480
of these situations again where

1254
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,078
it sits right around the threshold of

1255
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,119
significance that you've

1256
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,039
made for yourself uh and so that

1257
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,640
the the evidence is a little bit

1258
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,639
ambivalent

1259
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,838
so uh it's worth pointing these things

1260
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,440
out because sometimes you're not you

1261
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,960
wish the analyses would come out and

1262
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,280
provide you smoking guns every time but

1263
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,159
it doesn't always work that way

1264
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,480
uh so we do find some evidence for

1265
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,920
selection for firmness but certainly

1266
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,719
future studies are going to be required

1267
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,079
in order to validate that

1268
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,799
so perhaps one of the most interesting

1269
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,800
things that you can do

1270
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
one of the most interesting things you

1271
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
can do is take the data and actually

1272
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,159
calculate

1273
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,960
how closely related are all the samples

1274
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,358
to each other so make a giant pairwise

1275
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,960
genetic relatedness matrix and then ask

1276
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,000
yourself okay how many of these

1277
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,318
uh samples from the usda collection

1278
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,239
are clonally related they're actually

1279
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,719
essentially genetically identical

1280
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,399
barring some genotyping error you can

1281
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,000
see most accessions in the collection do

1282
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,119
not have another clone in the collection

1283
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,960
but

1284
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,039
about a quarter of them do they have at

1285
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,559
least one other tree in the collection

1286
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,440
that is named differently

1287
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,920
that is a clone of it okay and some of

1288
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,159
them have

1289
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,240
multiple trees that are all actually the

1290
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,639
same variety so in the case of

1291
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,239
golden delicious there are 22 golden

1292
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,039
delicious in the collection they're

1293
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,318
15 red delicious 10 macintosh and 8

1294
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,400
northern spy

1295
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,239
right and you can represent that here as

1296
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,720
a as a network

1297
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,598
where every single dot here is an

1298
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,559
accession in the

1299
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,519
in the collection and a line between

1300
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,679
them or an edge

1301
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,280
in the network as we call it represents

1302
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,679
a clonal relationship

1303
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,519
so you can see that there are lots quite

1304
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,919
a few that have one clonal relationship

1305
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,719
two three four five six and isn't very

1306
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,440
common but then

1307
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,078
seven or more uh is really quite common

1308
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,760
so

1309
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,200
uh we see several varieties that have

1310
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,319
seven or more and those are the popular

1311
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,239
varieties that have

1312
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,838
uh been propagated out and where

1313
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,358
multiple clones exist

1314
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:21,838
uh and are and are used um

1315
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,838
so sorry

1316
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,079
so you can do the exact same thing

1317
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
instead of looking at clonal

1318
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,280
relationships between

1319
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
uh varieties you can look at first

1320
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,560
degree relationships so either sibling

1321
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,880
or parent offspring

1322
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,480
so again here in panel c uh on the left

1323
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
hand side here you see

1324
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,920
each one of these nodes in the network

1325
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,358
represents an accession in the usda

1326
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,000
apple journalism collection

1327
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,679
and an edge or a line between them

1328
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,239
represents a first degree relative so

1329
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:50,559
either parent offspring or sibling

1330
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,399
so you can see we have in this histogram

1331
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,559
on the on the right hand side

1332
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,480
most varieties have zero like there are

1333
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,960
many many cases where a variety does not

1334
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,519
have a relative in the collection

1335
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,119
but then you see many of them have one a

1336
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,960
little bit fewer have two

1337
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
first-degree relatives three four five

1338
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,480
some of them have more than seven

1339
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,919
uh gold and delicious and red delicious

1340
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,400
have over 60

1341
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,440
first-degree relatives in the collection

1342
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,480
so when we talk about

1343
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,440
and 15 of the usda collection

1344
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,800
are actually related to the top eight

1345
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,720
varieties that are grown within the

1346
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,880
united states right now

1347
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,959
so you've got a huge amount of

1348
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,160
relatedness inside this over half of the

1349
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,199
collection actually is

1350
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,559
interrelated in a series of first-degree

1351
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,358
relationships in this network you can

1352
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,960
see how there's a

1353
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,960
big clump there that is all sort of

1354
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,760
interconnected that makes up over half

1355
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,358
the collection

1356
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
so when we say that ultimately when we

1357
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:41,598
want to do genetic mapping and we want

1358
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
to do it in a

1359
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
in a large population of unrelated

1360
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,078
individuals

1361
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,318
well this is not going to happen in the

1362
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,400
apple like all of these apples are

1363
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,960
they're like a big extended pedigree

1364
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,200
that you've got inside that collection

1365
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,440
and you can quantify the degree to which

1366
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,358
they're

1367
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,639
related in first-degree relatives in

1368
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,318
this manner

1369
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,838
what's particularly interesting i find

1370
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,119
is that uh when you look at those

1371
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,679
first-degree relatives and you

1372
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,800
highlight we among the varieties that

1373
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,440
we've genotyped we have

1374
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,720
out of the top ten we have eight of the

1375
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,240
top 10

1376
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,078
cultivars that are grown in terms of

1377
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,199
acreage in the usa so

1378
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,000
or according to the apple grower website

1379
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,759
something or other

1380
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,440
you got to pick some sort of source but

1381
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,520
anyway these are top like eight

1382
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,720
very well known widely grown varieties

1383
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,440
in the united states

1384
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,159
are highlighted in red those nodes and

1385
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,800
you can see

1386
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,639
the uh again first degree relatives are

1387
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
all connected with those

1388
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,000
edges in the network you can see that

1389
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,440
the

1390
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,800
there are numerous first-degree

1391
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,240
relationships golden delicious and red

1392
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,599
delicious again having over 60

1393
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,759
first-degree relatives

1394
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,359
and that 15 of the usda collection

1395
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,119
overall is actually connected by a first

1396
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,039
degree relative to these top eight

1397
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,720
and that the top eight in each other

1398
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,480
they're related to each other through a

1399
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,199
series of first-degree relationships so

1400
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,559
this is not

1401
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,559
all that different from what we found in

1402
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,000
grape as well where pinot noir and

1403
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,119
chardonnay and you can kind of walk

1404
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,960
through a series of first-degree

1405
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,400
relationships down to cabernet sauvignon

1406
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,720
and cabernet franc and

1407
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
riesling and they're all kind of related

1408
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,679
in a network of relatedness

1409
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,039
we see the same thing in apple here and

1410
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,719
there's one kind of

1411
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,318
exception here up in the top right hand

1412
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,239
corner is honeycrisp

1413
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,599
who only has one first degree relative

1414
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,559
in in the collection

1415
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,119
and honeycrisp is an interesting example

1416
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,639
uh

1417
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,400
because what we're what we're seeing

1418
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,960
here when we see this interrelatedness

1419
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,960
among

1420
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,000
cultivars it does suggest that we've you

1421
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,720
know breeders have

1422
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,239
made use of the tried and true tested

1423
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,879
varieties that are successful in the

1424
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,799
market

1425
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,720
it makes sense to go and use those as

1426
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,720
parents in the next generation

1427
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,039
that's what generates a huge number of

1428
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,199
first-degree relatives in the collection

1429
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,039
and with honeycrisp they did when they

1430
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,239
made the initial honey crisscross they

1431
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,559
thought that it was a cross

1432
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,078
between honeygold and mccown or mccoon

1433
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,000
i'm not sure how you pronounce it

1434
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,359
but uh and it turned out with genotyping

1435
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,639
afterwards that neither of those were

1436
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,440
actually the real parents of honey

1437
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,159
crisps their

1438
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,599
two other varieties and so uh honeycrisp

1439
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,399
is the only

1440
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,079
top successful cultivar here that is not

1441
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,920
interconnected to the other ones

1442
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,359
uh and that shares very few first-degree

1443
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,599
relationships with other varieties in

1444
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,639
the

1445
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,880
in the usda collection

1446
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,920
i suspect sean that that's going to uh

1447
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,480
change

1448
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
quickly too because thank you so much

1449
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,199
for

1450
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,960
uh for breeding programs now and so many

1451
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,439
of the new releases that are coming out

1452
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,199
of

1453
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,880
out of breeding programs use honeycrisp

1454
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,559
as a parent yeah and so i'm gonna i'm

1455
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,599
gonna just break in here because we do

1456
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,639
have a seminar

1457
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,160
that ends um at 1 30 and and um

1458
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,920
want to allow for at least a couple

1459
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,000
questions and i know that students have

1460
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,000
to move on for other classes

1461
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,679
so um maybe we're going to leave your

1462
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,280
concluding slide up here and people can

1463
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,000
read through that

1464
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,920
and just let people um either if

1465
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,559
somebody wants to raise a hand

1466
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,599
uh by using the little button below the

1467
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,759
participant

1468
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,720
pane or just uh jump in here and ask

1469
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,720
sean a question now

1470
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,160
hi i have a question go ahead i ask uh

1471
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
with such

1472
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,159
less genetic diversity does that affect

1473
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,440
the nutritional value

1474
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,519
more because they're not

1475
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,119
bringing in new traits or does that not

1476
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,599
have anything to do with it

1477
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,200
yeah it's funny that you know this less

1478
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,880
genetic diversity argument may not

1479
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,239
really apply just because things are

1480
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,160
related to each other

1481
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,159
uh doesn't necessarily mean that overall

1482
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,118
there's there's uh less genetic

1483
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,920
diversity they haven't been

1484
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,358
inbreeding it's not like we've been

1485
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,760
inbreeding varieties

1486
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,719
they are relatively closely related to

1487
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,119
each other but they're still

1488
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,838
extraordinarily diverse and heterozygous

1489
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,599
um

1490
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,880
whether that results in in less

1491
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,240
nutritional value i think that just

1492
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,920
needs to be measured

1493
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,598
right i think that's a measurable thing

1494
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,838
if anyone could actually

1495
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,599
agree on what nutritional value uh

1496
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,559
actually is and and how to measure it

1497
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,559
but

1498
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,159
that was that's that's outside of my not

1499
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,400
my department

1500
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,399
thank you another question

1501
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,000
um so sean without another question

1502
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,480
right now

1503
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,358
maybe um if you just wanted to do any

1504
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,599
acknowledgements

1505
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,838
and then maybe we can just um hang out i

1506
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,240
know that students may have to sign off

1507
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:11,759
but

1508
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,399
we can hang out for a couple few minutes

1509
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,400
and then you have another meeting and i

1510
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,599
want to just if everybody could give

1511
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,599
sean a virtual

1512
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,759
acknowledgement and thank him for his

1513
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:24,880
time and sharing this data with us today

1514
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,359
i really appreciate

1515
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,440
what you have done and your research has

1516
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,639
been is really fantastic

1517
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,599
all right thank you very much for your

1518
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,719
time i appreciate it

1519
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,480
and sean if you do have any

1520
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,078
acknowledgements please um share those

1521
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,440
yeah no that's that that's it i did them

1522
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,119
all at the front and acknowledged

1523
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,720
everybody right up front so this is this

1524
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,318
is it i can direct people to the website

1525
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:44,639
and then to our twitter feed so if you'd

1526
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:46,639
like to

1527
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,480
learn more then you can follow us on

1528
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,558
twitter

1529
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,240
uh it's a lot of fun to follow sean on

1530
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,599
twitter and he does

1531
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,679
you know of course my interest is in the

1532
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,079
apples but also in grapes and many other

1533
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,598
topics as well including hemp now

1534
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,280
i see larry's on the line so he might

1535
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,838
want to follow john's twitter feed

1536
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,440
there's also a very cool video on sean's

1537
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,519
website

1538
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,880
oh i i sorry i just thought of a

1539
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,679
question is okay if i ask

1540
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,039
go right ahead counter um so one thing i

1541
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,639
was wondering is i noticed that there

1542
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,039
were some cases where you were able to

1543
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,519
find

1544
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,358
loci that may be associated with

1545
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,199
adaptation but it seemed like as you

1546
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,239
said there weren't

1547
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,159
like for not all the major traits there

1548
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,919
there weren't always the super like

1549
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,519
smoking gun like super obvious things

1550
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,000
and i was wondering if you believe that

1551
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,920
for many of these traits that uh

1552
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,920
that adaptation could be polygenic and

1553
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,599
if so like how do we actually like tell

1554
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,680
what genes are involved in that

1555
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,519
because i know that is polygenic you

1556
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,719
don't always detect that in these

1557
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,519
uh fst scans super easily

1558
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,239
exactly yeah so if you have a a single

1559
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,199
gene of

1560
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,358
major effect imagine a mendelian locus

1561
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,279
that gave a particular advantage

1562
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,880
and it rose in frequency and showed a

1563
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,720
strong signature of selection then that

1564
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,800
would be very easy to detect

1565
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,159
of course if that trait that's been

1566
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,480
selected for

1567
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,480
is controlled by a thousand genes uh

1568
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,838
then you can imagine doing a genome scan

1569
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
you're going to come up probably with

1570
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:12,960
nothing

1571
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,079
depending on how much power you have in

1572
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,480
your analysis and

1573
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,200
that's where we we essentially we lack

1574
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,199
power

1575
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,199
uh because we have uh we haven't

1576
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,558
saturated the genome with markers

1577
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,199
we don't have uh really great phenotype

1578
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,599
data

1579
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,358
from you know multiple individuals and

1580
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,920
replicates and all the sorts of

1581
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,960
things that you can imagine having in a

1582
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,559
population of

1583
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,119
corn or rice or something and so it does

1584
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,040
become

1585
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,720
more difficult to detect that kind of

1586
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,239
polygenic selection the other thing

1587
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,159
to consider is that there may have been

1588
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,279
no selection right

1589
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,000
may haven't been really much right no we

1590
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,319
don't know

1591
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,400
how much selection occurs in each of the

1592
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,239
crops that we're making use of

1593
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,760
so you know in some cases there might

1594
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,199
not be much in other cases there may

1595
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
have been intense selection for certain

1596
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:59,919
traits

1597
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,318
and so without knowing what you know

1598
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,240
what proportion of the genome do you

1599
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,119
actually expect to carry a signature of

1600
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,759
selection

1601
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,720
a priori you don't really have an a

1602
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,400
priori

1603
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,318
idea of how much should be under

1604
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,838
selection so um

1605
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,519
really what you're doing in these kinds

1606
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,838
of analyses is looking for

1607
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,920
the lowest hanging fruit and when you do

1608
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:21,599
an analysis for example on the color

1609
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,440
you find a really strong signature of

1610
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,960
selection for color and so that makes a

1611
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,240
compelling story and you've got strong

1612
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,720
evidence that yep

1613
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,159
color was selected for but you're more

1614
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,279
likely to pick up color because it

1615
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,239
happens to be controlled by

1616
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,000
one major effect gene that mib gene and

1617
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,039
you may not find it for things maybe

1618
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,079
like firmness or

1619
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,599
for other loci controlled by or other

1620
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,880
traits controlled by too many they're

1621
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,480
too polygenic

1622
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,160
and you won't find that signature of

1623
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,039
selection with the data that we

1624
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,879
currently have

1625
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,400
or even with really great data sets if

1626
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,400
it's controlled by enough genes it might

1627
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,240
be really difficult to be able to detect

1628
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,160
so yeah you're absolutely right the

1629
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:59,358
genetic architecture of the trait is

1630
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,118
critical uh for your power and ability

1631
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,000
to detect it in these sorts of genome

1632
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,440
scans

1633
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,440
anna did you still have a question

1634
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,480
no i'm good thank you jonah did you have

1635
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,720
a question

1636
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,358
could i ask yeah i i do have a question

1637
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,159
uh can i ask you real quick um my

1638
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,719
question was

1639
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,920
over what time scale are you really

1640
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:26,078
looking at this ancestral selection

1641
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,599
because i think we all realize now with

1642
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,760
all these breeders that

1643
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,960
obviously there is a lot more selection

1644
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,480
that we see

1645
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,079
um on specific traits so what is the

1646
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,280
time scale of that kind of

1647
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,280
ancient selection from the more uh less

1648
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,240
derived varieties

1649
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,240
right so when looking at for example the

1650
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:50,000
difference between the

1651
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,358
um the domestica and the civersia

1652
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
you'd be looking all the way back to

1653
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,679
when they shared a common ancestor

1654
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,039
and then the same thing applies for each

1655
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,440
of the analyses so when we're

1656
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,440
comparing red and green apples uh what

1657
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,200
you're looking at is the differentiation

1658
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,480
since red and green apples diverge from

1659
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,439
each other which might be a really long

1660
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,559
time ago

1661
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,838
so it's it's not really putting a time

1662
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,559
scale on these things is a little

1663
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,759
difficult

1664
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,160
um but it is it is in fact in some cases

1665
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,640
with

1666
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,920
really great data you can do this in

1667
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,960
terms of counting up the number of

1668
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,760
generations

1669
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,159
that and model it out uh that might be a

1670
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,160
little

1671
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,719
difficult i think in this situation with

1672
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,719
a long-lived woody perennial that can

1673
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,039
one of the things with apples is that

1674
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,639
you know you can you can mate with your

1675
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,079
great you can have an apple mate with

1676
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,960
its great great grandparents because

1677
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,119
there's no real

1678
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,358
generational time uh which makes the the

1679
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,440
relatedness networks kind of strange and

1680
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,880
and the idea of time and generations a

1681
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,318
little strange as well but

1682
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,920
because you can vegetatively propagate

1683
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,000
them for 200 years and it remains the

1684
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,559
same individual for 200 years

1685
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,358
so uh might be tricky it might be

1686
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,440
possible but

1687
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,880
i i'm not able to give real timelines

1688
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,079
for the uh

1689
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,358
for the the timing of the selection for

1690
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,559
these different things but needless to

1691
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,239
say certainly

1692
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,920
uh that breeders have honed in a lot

1693
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,159
more over the last 50 years on

1694
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,318
on certain traits than uh than was the

1695
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,318
case before and when i say breeding

1696
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,400
you know 500 years ago it may not have

1697
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,639
really been all that intentional

1698
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,358
uh and it may not have been you know

1699
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,118
making crosses and capturing pollen and

1700
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,279
making intentional pollinations that may

1701
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,160
have been just keeping the offspring out

1702
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,839
of uh from

1703
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,318
random seedlings that looked the most

1704
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:30,719
desirable so

1705
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,400
and sean somebody else um i think had a

1706
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,919
question and that will be our last one

1707
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,318
because you'll need a couple minutes and

1708
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,000
then

1709
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,358
um you have a visit with the grad

1710
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,559
student starting at 1

1711
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,719
40. great did somebody

1712
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,240
have a question they wanted yes yes yes

1713
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,919
uh here actually

1714
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,159
and uh i have a quick question for you

1715
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,280
sean and so you mentioned about the

1716
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,639
knack 18

1717
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,519
and the slips actually so what's the

1718
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,879
nature of the

1719
00:53:53,519 --> 00:54:00,318
sleep this is a loss of function oh

1720
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,200
you know yeah so we

1721
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,519
yeah so we we're collecting gbs data so

1722
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,439
uh

1723
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,280
we get whatever snip happens to land

1724
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,920
nearby and is probably

1725
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,079
in ld with the functional allele that's

1726
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,318
what we always assume

1727
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,440
but that snip actually happens to be a

1728
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:19,039
non-synonymous

1729
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,880
snip in the in a binding domain of the

1730
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,800
neck gene that's described in that plant

1731
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,640
genome paper

1732
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,318
so it may be functional but we've done

1733
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,920
some additional sequencing of knack and

1734
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:29,519
it turns out there's all sorts of

1735
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,680
variation in knack that could be

1736
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,800
functional that is linked to that d5y

1737
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,759
mutation

1738
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,680
and we're going to do a more

1739
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
comprehensive sequencing of that entire

1740
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,000
gene across a large

1741
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,798
number of accessions plug that genotype

1742
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,159
data back into the gwas and see which

1743
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:46,880
which of the markers is really most

1744
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,598
strongly associated uh with the uh

1745
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,519
with the phenotype um there's also like

1746
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,760
a huge deletion right in the middle of

1747
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,920
one of the domains too so it could be

1748
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,440
a presence absence variation a copy

1749
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,280
number variation or

1750
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,119
a structural variation going on within

1751
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,480
that gene so we're going to try to tease

1752
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,519
that out with a little more additional

1753
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,358
sequencing but

1754
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,358
to date no the causal allele that that

1755
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:10,558
locus is not known

1756
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,239
cool thanks sean and um boy

1757
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,920
you know if it was up to me i would just

1758
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,159
say this is the rest of our day and we

1759
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,559
just keep you on the line

1760
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:20,798
but i know you have other appointments

1761
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,640
for the afternoon and

1762
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:23,838
other people have other activities so

1763
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,318
again everybody

1764
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:26,960
thank you um thank join me in thanking

1765
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,519

his time and his um his sharing his

1767
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:36,159
expertise and his research with us today

1768
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,160
thank you thanks folks thank you
