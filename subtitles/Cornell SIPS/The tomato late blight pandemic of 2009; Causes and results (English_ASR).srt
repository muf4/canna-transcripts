1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,240
so thanks very much i appreciate the

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,919
opportunity to um speak to the

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,879
horticulture today

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,759
about this really uh bizarre event and i

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,198
think so how many of you grow tomatoes

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
and yeah and how many of you had

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
problems in 2009

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,399
yeah

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,920
so it was absolutely bizarre and i

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,039
thought i'd just like to explain a

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
little bit about that

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,679
some of the

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,480
it was uh it was a pandemic it made

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,840
the national and international news

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,519
here's

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
a quote from the new york times on the

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
17th of july 2009

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,558
says a highly contagious fungus that

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,000
destroys tomato plants has quickly

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,640
spread to nearly every state in the

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,238
northeast and the mid-atlantic and the

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
weather over the next week may determine

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,799
whether the outbreak a base of whether

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,799
tomato crops are ruined

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,959
and then in august

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,560
there was this headline that appeared in

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,478
the new york times and according to this

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
guy he says you say tomato i say

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,200
agricultural disaster

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
and that was um from an organic tomato

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,719
grower who ships directly to high-end

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,000
markets in new york city

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,478
and he lost a lot of his tomatoes that

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,438
year and i think many people had the

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,920
same experience throughout the northeast

38
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,199
actually my tomatoes weren't too bad

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
um

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,600
in 2009

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
i went to um empire farm days on uh in

42
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,839
august

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
and i was talking with some people and

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
the guy who lived not too far from me a

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
couple miles away and i lived in the

46
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,359
town of anfield he said i lost all my

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
tomatoes i thought whoa i'm going to

48
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,078
start spraying my my tomatoes so i did

49
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:56,399
and um i actually did okay in 2009.

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,078
uh what i want to do is to give you some

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,799
very introductory comments there may be

52
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,639
a few of you who

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
don't know that much about late blight

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
uh if you have questions about late

55
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,560
blight i'm going to pass them to brian

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
because i talk a lot about late blight

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
in my class

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,598
and

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
i'm going to talk first of all about

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,959
migrations of the pathogen phytophthora

61
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,719
infestant worldwide migrations but also

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
migrations that have happened within the

63
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,719
united states

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
a focus specifically on what happened in

65
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,159
2009 and then what's happened subsequent

66
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,359
to 2009 and i'll finish by giving some

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,598
predictions

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
about management of this particular

69
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,799
disease

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,560
i want to uh describe to you um

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,439
actually what i should do is ask brian

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,439
to describe this

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
this is the

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,360
um

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,719
asexual cycle of phytophthora infestance

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
but i just wanted to illustrate it to

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,479
you

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
this organism reproduces by producing

79
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,039
sporangia

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,479
and this is a micrograph of a sporangium

81
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,400
here it's giving birth to a zoaspore

82
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,359
these zoa spores are about 10

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,800
micrometers in diameter

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
and they're interesting because they

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
have two flagella here's a schematic

86
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,919
drawing of them a forward directed

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
tensile type flagellum and a posterior

88
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,479
directed

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,158
whiplash flagellum and they they are

90
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,798
immortal for

91
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,679
minutes to up to an hour

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
if

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
this

94
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,280
zoa spore lands on a leaf and causes

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
penetrates the leaf it can produce a

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,959
very small lesion that looks like this

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,199
in about three or possibly four days

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,799
it's um takes at least two two and a

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,679
half to three days before you see any

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,560
symptom at all and this is probably

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,560
three to four days old

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,479
within a couple days that lesion can

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
expand and the pathogen has grown

104
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,119
throughout this tissue

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,680
and if that lesion is subjected to very

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
moist weather leap wetness for 10 11 or

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,159
12 hours

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,360
it can sporulate brian how am i doing

109
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,359
pretty good so far okay thanks

110
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,920
all right

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
so

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,639
so this is a lot this is the pathogen

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,680
sporulating on leaf now brian how many

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,680
sporangia are on that lease

115
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
he wants to hear your question

116
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,478
no it's brian he doesn't deserve it all

117
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
right

118
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,478
that goes with the name

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,680
um

120
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,000
so this is a

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,800
potato leaflet this passage goes to both

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
tomatoes and potatoes it's actually more

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
famous as i'll say in just a minute as a

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
potato pathogen than as a tomato

125
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,159
pathogen that is two people have worked

126
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
with it for a long time people who grow

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
tomatoes don't know that

128
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
necessarily but but it is anyway um

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
there are probably more than a million

130
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,679
sporangia on that uh leaflet

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,079
um

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,319
and if you were to look at this with a

133
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,639
dissection scope or a hand lens you'd

134
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,038
see the sporangia among the trichomes on

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,240
this potato leaf if you look at it

136
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,478
through a compound microscope you'd see

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,478
the

138
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,000
sporangiophores and here's the

139
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,240
sporangium

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
when the weather changes in the morning

141
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
particularly and the dew dries off of

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
the leaf

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,959
these sporangia

144
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
are actually

145
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,918
discharged

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
and

147
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,279
here's one that has

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
been discharged and these can be

149
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,959
aerially dispersed

150
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,198
if they land on a surface that has free

151
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,839
moisture they can germinate

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
so this is the asexual cycle

153
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,119
it's really dramatically important it

154
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,519
can

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,439
happen in between four and a half to

156
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,680
five days depending on whether depending

157
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,918
upon how susceptible the

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
the um

159
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,000
the host crop is

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
and it's um it's really quite dramatic

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
and it's so dramatic that it can turn a

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,759
field of potatoes that looks something

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,840
like this within

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
eight or nine or ten days to a field of

165
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,318
potatoes that looks something like that

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,720
and in other another eight or nine days

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,879
it can look something like this so i can

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
tell you that every last bit of potato

169
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,918
full and this is a potato field thank

170
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,479
you brian

171
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,799
every last bit of tomat potato foliage

172
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,758
has been destroyed now you'll see some

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
green here and here that's pigweed

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
and this is

175
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,879
a grass of some sort

176
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
but all of the potato foliage

177
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,478
was dead i took this picture in august

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
of 1994. this is a late season cultivar

179
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,318
it should have been green until

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,918
mid-october mid-september excuse me so

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,919
it was totally dead

182
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,240
um well over a month before it should

183
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,359
have been and that was caused by late

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,038
blight caused by phytophthora infestands

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,160
so in addition destroying destroying

186
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,199
foliage

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,400
this pathogen also infects tubers

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,439
and this is a really important fact is

189
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,399
that the pathogen can overwinter in

190
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,800
infected tubers in a potato storage

191
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,679
or if there are tubers left in the soil

192
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,400
and and the tubers don't freeze

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,639
then can survive in volunteers the next

194
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,719
year or it can survive in great big

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
piles of cold potatoes

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
one of which is pictured here

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,959
and

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,360
this is i took this picture in i think

199
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,719
1994 also

200
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
and

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
actually don halseth is pictured in this

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
um this image john do you know where you

203
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,638
are

204
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
you were in steven county yeah but i

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
mean right here

206
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
it's really good you know where you are

207
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
um

208
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,318
so that this uh this is a

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,639
tons and tons of

210
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
tubers that were dumped because this the

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,360
grower had harvested the tubers

212
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
about a week previously he'd had late

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,439
blight in the field it was really warm

214
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,280
and wet that harvest season those

215
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
conditions are just perfect for

216
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,638
infection by with phytophthora

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,478
infestands

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,280
so the potatoes were put into storage

219
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,279
they were warm they were wet

220
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,359
and in

221
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,958
late blight lesions on a tuber are

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,879
spectacular places for erwinia karatavra

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,278
or pectobacterium

224
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,320
sorry brain pectobacterium keratovrum

225
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,240
can infect and cause soft rot and so

226
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
these potatoes were just melting in

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,799
storage it was just just going down and

228
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,879
it was it was a huge storage john do you

229
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,519
remember how large

230
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,519
that was it was

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
about okay about ten thousand hundred

232
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,278
weight

233
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
so the uh can you imagine the these

234
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,240
potatoes were about four or five feet

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,959
deep all the way down into the bottom of

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,799
that goalie which was 40 or 50 feet down

237
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,599
what i'm thinking of is the

238
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,679
the

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
amount of bacteria pectoral bacteria was

240
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,399
going downstream

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,879
from this pile of potatoes

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,799
probably most of the pathogen did not

243
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,039
survive in this because the tubers were

244
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,159
so rotten

245
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,599
i want to talk a little bit about the

246
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,799
sexual cycle of this organism because

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,680
that's also important

248
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,159
this is a picture of an orgonium

249
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,599
and here's an antheridium so this is the

250
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,759
female structure this is the male

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
structure and a nucleus migrates from

252
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,958
the antheridium into the orgonium and

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,639
fertilizes

254
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,759
the oregonium

255
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,679
and

256
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
once that fertilization occurs then we

257
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,120
get a

258
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,639
an ospor

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
identified here and you see it's very

260
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,958
thick walled structure

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
these osbors can survive for years in

262
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,359
soil

263
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
as far as we know

264
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,919
that does not yet happen in the united

265
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,440
states

266
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,278
there are places in the world where it

267
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,880
does happen it certainly happens in

268
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,200
central mexico and the highlands of

269
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,519
central mexico

270
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,399
within the last 20 to 30 years we know

271
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,240
that it happens in

272
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
northern europe particularly in

273
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,159
scandinavia and also in northeastern

274
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
europe but in most places in the world

275
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,120
and i think also throughout the united

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
states

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,159
we don't know yet that oa spores

278
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,559
occur because we don't think sexual

279
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,278
reproduction is yet a factor in the

280
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,679
united states

281
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,958
so most people have heard about potato

282
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,519
late blight

283
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,278
because of the famine it caused in

284
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
ireland in

285
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,000
the mid 19th century

286
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,959
this book is actually a fascinating book

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,078
it's by a female author who took a male

288
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,000
pseudonym

289
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,838
um to write about it

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,120
um it says 1845 to 1849 it's really just

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,320
a chronicle

292
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,919
of what happened there's not much

293
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
emotion except the facts and figures are

294
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,159
so awful

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
that

296
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,278
they're just presented in a in a really

297
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,159
bald way

298
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,559
and

299
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,639
there were many

300
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,278
cartoons if you will in newspapers this

301
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,360
is one from that period in which

302
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,278
this represents ireland says help and

303
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
says we are starving

304
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,039
so the

305
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,679
irish potato family was really awful as

306
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,679
many of you know

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,079
this is late blight was not known to the

308
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,240
western world until 18

309
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,879
until the mid 19th century

310
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,120
and this is a picture of

311
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,759
the development of this new disease in

312
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,679
europe starting in 1845

313
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,078
the first occurrence was detected in

314
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,278
belgium at the end of june and then this

315
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,479
new disease

316
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,720
appeared

317
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,039
later in the season as we went through

318
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,879
the summer of 1845

319
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,480
until by the end of the season all of

320
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,838
ireland had been affected by the late

321
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,759
blight

322
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,560
one of the reasons that

323
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,799
ireland was so severely affected

324
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,958
is that

325
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,759
potatoes were just a huge

326
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,879
component of the

327
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,000
of the diet for people

328
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,000
for example

329
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
if you were among the the

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
lowest class the cuttier smallholders

331
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
and landless laborers

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,958
your calorie intake was from eating 12

333
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,759
pounds of potatoes a day

334
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,559
and this is for most of the year

335
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,480
and what but but so when that food

336
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,838
source was destroyed you can see what it

337
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,360
would do to one's um

338
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,600
one's calorie intake what i learned

339
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,000
which was really fascinating

340
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,720
is that potatoes probably caused a

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
population explosion in ireland

342
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
and there were no censuses in or sensai

343
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,560
in

344
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:56,159
in ireland in the 19th or 19th century

345
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,319
but it's estimated that the population

346
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,120
of ireland at the end of the 18th

347
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
century was about 3 million people

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
it's estimated that by the mid 19th

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,278
century it was about 10 million people

350
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,000
and potatoes had become a major calorie

351
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,679
source in the end of the 18th century in

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,919
ireland which enabled this huge

353
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,039
population explosion

354
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,958
and

355
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,278
it wasn't uncommon for mom and dad to

356
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,439
have 18 18 kids

357
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,838
they could subsist on

358
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
potatoes they could heat a one-room

359
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,720
stone house with pete

360
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,360
and it really created this very huge

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,600
population explosion

362
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,278
okay now i want to talk about migrations

363
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,680
um worldwide but mainly in the u.s

364
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,600
the reason i said mid-19th century for

365
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,638
western science knowing about this

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
disease

367
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,799
is because it appeared first

368
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
let's see

369
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,000
it appeared first in

370
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
the u.s

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,320
around maybe around philadelphia around

372
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:00,719
new york in 1843 and here's uh this

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,959
illustrates how it radiated out from

374
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,959
1843 to 1844 to 1845.

375
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
so one of the questions is where did

376
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
this organism come from

377
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,600
and i'm going to suggest to you that it

378
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,759
came from central mexico

379
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
there is a significant debate about

380
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,679
where this organism came from it was

381
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
debated at the end of the 18th century

382
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,879
and through the 20th century or at least

383
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,159
to until the middle of the 20th century

384
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,000
when everyone

385
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,399
that is most scientists agreed that

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
maybe it came from central mexico then

387
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
in the late 20th century some of my

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,879
colleagues suggested no it didn't come

389
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,079
from central mexico it came from south

390
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,039
america

391
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,958
where potatoes also originated

392
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,879
i think the developing data now will

393
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,078
confirm that it probably is

394
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,360
or originated in central mexico

395
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,278
so

396
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,240
sometime

397
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,838
let's see

398
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
sometime before

399
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,519
1842 it could have come

400
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,760
from

401
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,720
central mexico to the states

402
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:04,879
it could have come from the states to

403
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,959
europe sometime before june of 1845

404
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,799
and that would that's easy to imagine it

405
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,759
would an infected tuber could be taken

406
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,599
on a ship

407
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,120
taken to europe

408
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
the path you could sporulate from that

409
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,000
infected tuber and it could initiate

410
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,078
disease

411
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,078
or that one possibility is that it might

412
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,559
have come directly from europe excuse me

413
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,479
from central mexico to europe

414
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,119
from central europe

415
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
it's very clear as to how it moved uh

416
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
because there's a very active seed

417
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,799
potato trade from europe to the rest of

418
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,800
the world except to the us in canada

419
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,240
so potatoes go to south america to

420
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,958
africa to asia uh and and all over uh

421
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,919
from uh northwest europe so it's easy to

422
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,719
see how this organism could get around

423
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,519
in the late 1980s there was clearly

424
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,800
a migration from

425
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,159
northern mexico to the u.s

426
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,838
the reason i know that it was from

427
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,319
northern mexico is that we had been

428
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
sampling in sinaloa state

429
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
prior to

430
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,719
the occurrence of new strains

431
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,879
in both the pacific northwest and also

432
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
the east coast and had found the very

433
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,919
same genotypes of phytophthora

434
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,120
infestands

435
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,879
in northwest mexico before they arrived

436
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,278
in the united states

437
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,439
so it's really clear as to where

438
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,198
our populations came from in the late

439
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,959
1980s

440
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,479
what i want to illustrate to you is

441
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,479
again is how

442
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
interestingly and how fast this organism

443
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,000
can get around

444
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,399
we detected this particular strain of

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,679
phytophthora infestands

446
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,360
in the summer of night of

447
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,198
1992.

448
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,600
it was oswego county it was not in

449
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,078
ithaca it was not tompkins county it was

450
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,759
in oswego county

451
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,479
and then we got a sample from maine in

452
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,800
1993

453
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,879
which was also the same genotype and it

454
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,758
was again this usa

455
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,759
clonal lineage

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,799
in

457
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,119
the next year too

458
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
this same genotype was spread throughout

459
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,438
the united states

460
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
in 1994 it was in the eastern half of

461
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,720
the united states and in 1995

462
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,119
it affected all of the western potato

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,038
production areas in the united states so

464
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,399
this this

465
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,959
pathogen gets around in infected tubers

466
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
those infected tubers go from the potato

467
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,360
seed producing areas all over

468
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,599
from they go from

469
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,678
in this case maine all the up and down

470
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,918
the west coast new york produces seed

471
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,360
tubers michigan wisconsin minnesota

472
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,520
north dakota

473
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,199
uh idaho oregon and washington all

474
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,279
produce seed tubers and they go in

475
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,519
trucks so this organism gets around in

476
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,240
trucks for intercontinental

477
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,240
migrations

478
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,640
1994 when i took those pictures was

479
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,759
really a severe year

480
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,038
and

481
00:17:53,759 --> 00:18:00,960
this picture was taken in in august and

482
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,079
what i wanted there were several reports

483
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,200
in the newspaper about

484
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,240
the

485
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,558
impact of this disease on pathogens this

486
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,120
is a farmer byron chapman who grew

487
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,319
potatoes near utica new york

488
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,678
he lost his entire crop in 1994 to late

489
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,319
blight

490
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,960
he declared bankruptcy the next year and

491
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,879
he died about a year or two after that

492
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,679
so my my

493
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,480
conclusion was that the stress of losing

494
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,759
his crop losing his farm was so severe

495
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,759
that it really caused him

496
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,160
cost him his life

497
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,159
it was all because of this strain of

498
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
phytophthora infestance

499
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,120
it was resistant to what had been one of

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,558
the most effective fungicides and people

501
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,279
when they saw late blight would spray

502
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,359
this fungicide methanoxan

503
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,599
expecting it to completely

504
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,879
halt the disease but it didn't and when

505
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,439
that didn't happen they didn't know what

506
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,360
to do and so

507
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,000
and this disease is so explosive that it

508
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,959
just destroyed these potato crops in

509
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,038
1994 and 1995.

510
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,919
okay so what happened in 2009

511
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,038
so from our own abby seaman we got this

512
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,600
note

513
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:21,279
on june 23rd 2009

514
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,639
she said to the late blight listserv she

515
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,480
said late blight has been found at

516
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
several locations in our reporting area

517
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,319
this past week and then here's a quote

518
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,079
from meg mcgrath on long island

519
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,918
she said a sample just came in there's

520
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,639
lots of sporulation the field had been

521
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,280
sprayed with fungicide

522
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,000
and growers are taking action

523
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,480
and then on the next day the 24th of

524
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,240
june 2009

525
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,319
um keith perry who's my next door

526
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,558
neighbor on on the third floor of plant

527
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,639
science building came in with a tomato

528
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,759
plant that was severely infected with

529
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,759
lake light

530
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,558
he said bill what do you think of this

531
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,160
i said wow

532
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,558
it's got late light

533
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,840
i said where'd that come from

534
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,918
lowe's

535
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,599
is where it came from so

536
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,120
um we went to lowe's and took pictures

537
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,439
so these are

538
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,719
tomato transplants that are that were

539
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
for sale

540
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,319
on june 24 2009

541
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,960
not only lowe's but walmart

542
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,678
home depot there was one more that had

543
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,919
these same transplants for sale

544
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,080
and they were really all heavily

545
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,559
infected with phytophthora investing

546
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,558
these are large lesions you know they

547
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,759
have been there for a while

548
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:39,599
and so these plants had been um

549
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,599
infected for really quite some time

550
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,038
so on the 24th of

551
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,200
june in 2009 there was we knew that

552
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,200
suffolk county had infected tomato

553
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,360
plants we knew that tompkins county had

554
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,840
tomato infected tomato plants

555
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,798
so here's a note from tom zitter on the

556
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,279
26th of june

557
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,000
in 2009 and it's really fascinating he

558
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,480
said yesterday i did a quick tour of

559
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,798
garden centers in the ithaca area all

560
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,400
three big retail stores had late blight

561
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,639
infected tomatoes on their shelves

562
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
yesterday afternoon some agreed to

563
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
remove the plants while i was there

564
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,639
while others were awaiting word from the

565
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,080
new york supplier

566
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
tomato plants have been replaced with

567
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,879
additional plants every few days and

568
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,960
then he said i also received word that

569
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
late blight infected plants from large

570
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,200
large retailers were found in cerro

571
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,000
pennsylvania schenectady county and as

572
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,798
far east as presque isle maine presque

573
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,759
isle maine is a

574
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,519
in

575
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,599
aroostook county

576
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:45,158
maine where there's

577
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,158
70 000 acres of potatoes being produced

578
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,959
so on the 26th these

579
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
counties had reported late blight

580
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,240
oops

581
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,880
by the 8th of july in 2009 these

582
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,319
counties had reported late blight

583
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,760
so at that point i thought you know i

584
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,399
better get out of plant science building

585
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,400
go look around

586
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,759
so

587
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,599
who who knows where this is

588
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,679
oh that looks like it's over near fall

589
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,639
creek yeah

590
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,400
you got it so this is on freeze road

591
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,720
and that's where i went

592
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,519
and here's what i saw

593
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,120
each of those spots is a late light

594
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,918
lesion

595
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,199
these uh dying and by the way this is a

596
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,440
tomato plant

597
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
um

598
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,639
and

599
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
these are dead and dying leaves and

600
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
infected by phytophthora infestants

601
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,798
in the same garden

602
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,720
i looked at potatoes

603
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,720
and sure enough they were infected also

604
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,200
and so by the 16th of june

605
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,599
there have been these many counties

606
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,640
reporting late blight in new york state

607
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,199
and by the 17th of august this many

608
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,919
counties had been reporting late blight

609
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,600
in new york state

610
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,400
so i thought i'd tally that you know

611
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,158
just do a cumulative

612
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
tally of the number of reports to our

613
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,360
diagnostic lab about late blight

614
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,279
and you can see that the first

615
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,359
event was in

616
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,480
mid-june and here's the report on the

617
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,519
23rd

618
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,759
here's the 24th the 25th

619
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,000
i want and then it goes way up to above

620
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,319
140 reports i want to compare that with

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,558
2008 the number of reports of late

622
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,879
blight in new york state so there were

623
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,119
three samples received by our diagnostic

624
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,799
by our diagnostic lab

625
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,558
none of them was late light they were

626
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,558
all suspected so there was zero late

627
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,079
blight in new york imported to our

628
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,759
diagnostic lab in 2008 but in 2009 we

629
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,558
had this um

630
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,558
this kind of reporting

631
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,440
i also thought i'd say that

632
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,839
37 of these 30 or 49 reports that were

633
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,720
occurred over a period of six days were

634
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,038
from retail stores which is was not

635
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,000
normal

636
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,839
and some of our colleagues in the state

637
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,519
from cornell cooperative extension would

638
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,399
go to store find that there was late

639
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,759
light there and suggest to the

640
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,840
manager that you have to get rid of

641
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,079
these plants they're a problem

642
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,240
so what happened was

643
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,678
that

644
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,519
some people

645
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
put them on sale to move them out

646
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,200
this is a

647
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
this is a picture of an organic farm not

648
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,640
too far from here

649
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,960
i was there in early august 2009

650
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,080
this they had 10 or 11 plantings of

651
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,319
tomatoes

652
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,158
this is either the 10th or 11th planting

653
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,439
it was only planting left they removed

654
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
everything else because it had been

655
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
affected by late blight

656
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,480
these were going to be destroyed and

657
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,799
moved very quickly because as you can

658
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
see they are very severely affected and

659
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,440
that story was repeated many times in

660
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,840
many locations

661
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,120
in 2009

662
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,558
this is a message i got from a lady

663
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,158
growing

664
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,918
tomatoes

665
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,600
in amsterdam new york or near amsterdam

666
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,919
it's just illustrative according to the

667
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,918
impact that this epidemic had

668
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
she said i am an organic gardener in

669
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,640
amsterdam new york with 63 heirloom

670
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,159
tomato plants of 23 different varieties

671
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,559
they're all gone

672
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,480
i was growing very rare varieties black

673
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,480
screens oranges whites

674
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
all purchased from a very reputable

675
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,120
grower in schoharie

676
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,038
tonight i had to leave home

677
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,558
as my husband is pulling and begging all

678
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,000
63 plants

679
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,918
i have 100 loss we live on 10 acres i

680
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,759
inspected every day and it seems the

681
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,720
blight took my plants in a matter of

682
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,720
hours

683
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
i was hoping to sell them for additional

684
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
income it always chokes me up i read

685
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
that

686
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
so

687
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,678
um that was repeated many times so the

688
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,759
question for us was you know what what

689
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,000
was this and what was the composition of

690
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,679
the pathogen population

691
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,240
in 2009

692
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,120
so we had received more than 70 samples

693
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,720
we do several types of assays with these

694
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,119
the samples that came from commercial

695
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,960
potatoes were usa the strain that we'd

696
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,239
been having seeing for really quite some

697
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,319
time but the ones from tomatoes were

698
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,839
something different and i'll illustrate

699
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,200
that to you here

700
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,558
um

701
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,400
this is a protein assay that we use

702
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,079
and one of the reasons is so great is we

703
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,240
can do this assay within about two hours

704
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,240
and haven't have an answer if we have a

705
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,759
spoilaging lesion we can do do that

706
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
assay very quickly

707
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,079
and for example here's the pattern that

708
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,960
we get with us-8

709
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,119
but in 2009 what we got was this pattern

710
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,558
which is which is rather different now

711
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,439
we also were doing

712
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,759
dna fingerprinting but the this assay

713
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,200
takes us you know four to ten weeks we

714
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,759
have to culture the organism get enough

715
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,759
dna to actually do a southern

716
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,200
and um

717
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,558
here's uh

718
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,278
this is the dna fingerprint for the us-8

719
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,599
strain of phytophthora infestands

720
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,519
and this these four columns represent

721
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,359
dna from four different individuals of

722
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,798
phytophthora infestands which have a

723
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,599
different pattern

724
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,079
and this one we named us-22 because the

725
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,079
the terminology had got to that point uh

726
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,960
by this time

727
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,879
so

728
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,480
that we had uh in the last several years

729
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
we've had various strains of

730
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,278
phytophthora infestations usaid is still

731
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,960
around

732
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:28,480
us 20 was dominant in 2009

733
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,038
and more recently us-23 and us-24

734
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,278
are dominant and the reason we can

735
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,119
identify specific strains is because of

736
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,679
asexual reproduction

737
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,879
so we get a clonal lineage it's all the

738
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,600
same thing

739
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,760
and some of these can be um very very

740
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,719
dominant and so it makes sense to

741
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:49,519
understand what they are

742
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,558
so back to 2009

743
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,639
we know that late blight was produced in

744
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,798
production facilities in both new york

745
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
and in maine

746
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,480
after the end of the season we we had

747
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,200
accumulated isolates from other places

748
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,558
and it turns out the same strain us-22

749
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,319
was was

750
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,000
found throughout the u.s

751
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,000
the question is where did it come from

752
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,599
and

753
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,000
here's the picture from lowe's

754
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,000
bonnie plants has a production facility

755
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,398
in alabama

756
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,038
and it's just very clear to me

757
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:26,079
that they shipped infected plants from

758
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:29,599
their production facility in alabama to

759
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,398
the production facilities in new york

760
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,599
and

761
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,519
maine

762
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,278
we met with representatives from bonnie

763
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,240
plants in

764
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,798
in november of 2009

765
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,759
and this is one of their responses

766
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,879
we don't ship plants we ship plugs

767
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,720
can somebody tell me what a plug is

768
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,799
it's a small plant it's a small plant

769
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,880
yeah

770
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,158
so they have they've never admitted to

771
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,679
doing anything

772
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,799
as far as they haven't been sued but

773
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,679
they've

774
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,278
when talks like mine happened they got

775
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
quite belligerent

776
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,200
um but they were the cause of this huge

777
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,278
pandemic

778
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,720
in 2009. they have

779
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,640
subsequently cleaned up their act quite

780
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,679
considerably tom zitter is consulting

781
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,679
with them and illustrating how

782
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,519
to prevent late blind

783
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,360
okay i want to move on to after

784
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,240
2009

785
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,558
and to focus on the needed ipm research

786
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,079
that has been happening what i want to

787
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,038
do is to focus on a tool that i think

788
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,839
can be really quite useful

789
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,440
this is a decision support system

790
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,119
which i think will enable integrated

791
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,200
management a very effective and

792
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,798
efficient integrated management of late

793
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,720
blight it takes into account the weather

794
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,639
and weather is huge in terms of late

795
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,360
blight development

796
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,120
it incorporates cultivar resistance

797
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,918
because there are some cultivars that

798
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,359
are

799
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,960
actually at this point immune there are

800
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,000
some that are quite susceptible and

801
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,919
others that are less susceptible

802
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,519
there are several forecasting schemes

803
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,120
that have been used in the us and it

804
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,079
contains those

805
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,479
is responsive to pathogen type and also

806
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,000
to fungicide sodium it's a tool to

807
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,640
enable a grower

808
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,798
to take account all of these

809
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
factors

810
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,599
what one of the most interesting things

811
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,519
to me is the location specific weather

812
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,398
you can get weather data

813
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,918
from the nearest weather station to you

814
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,599
some growers have purchased weather

815
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,000
stations so they have on-farm weather

816
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,879
data there's a transmitted

817
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,558
via telephone to actually to bradfield

818
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,240
hall

819
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,359
and in addition to getting previous

820
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
weather

821
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,278
uh the

822
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,919
weather center here gets weather

823
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,519
forecast for the next seven days

824
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,000
and those weather forecasts are

825
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,240
automatically downloaded um

826
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,319
to the system and the weather forecast

827
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,278
can be interpolated on a four kilometer

828
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,960
grid

829
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,119
so that you can have a weather forecast

830
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,038
that is specific within probably two

831
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,639
kilometers of view

832
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,079
for what the weather might be and that's

833
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,840
that's really important because late

834
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,918
blight can is very responsive to weather

835
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,079
there are these two disease forecasting

836
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,960
tools that are present in it

837
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,960
there is a late blight disease simulator

838
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,000
on which one can do experiments and i'll

839
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,519
say a little bit more about the

840
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,919
simulator later on

841
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,000
and there's an alert system that can

842
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,399
give you information about what to

843
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,398
expect

844
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
so let me talk just a little bit about

845
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,798
pathogen type

846
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,720
i mentioned

847
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,480
these lineages of phytophthora

848
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,839
infestands

849
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,519
in 2009 almost everything we found was

850
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,359
us-22 and that's because it was

851
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,599
transported on bonnie plants throughout

852
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,558
the northeast

853
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,839
and then

854
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,119
us-8 was also present but it was present

855
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,959
primarily on commercial potatoes and it

856
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,119
gets transmitted very effectively on

857
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
potato tubers

858
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,278
in

859
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
2010

860
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,960
we had a new lineage that began to

861
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,278
appear primarily in the western part of

862
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,720
the u.s it's us-24

863
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:05,519
also us23 began to appear uh wasn't real

864
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
dominant us 22 was still present

865
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,558
and us-8 was present

866
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,359
and the sample size is typically between

867
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:17,918
150 and 200 for each of these bar graphs

868
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,959
i didn't want to do that

869
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,159
in 2011

870
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,720
us24 became more visible and us-23

871
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,120
became even more visible whereas us 23

872
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,960
of 22 became less so

873
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,959
but in 2012

874
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
this last year almost everything we saw

875
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,079
was us 23.

876
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,278
it was

877
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,839
really

878
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:39,839
a surprise

879
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,600
so why is it

880
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:48,240
at all interesting or important to know

881
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:50,319
what lineage you have or that's near you

882
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,558
one of the reasons is that

883
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,599
some of these lineages are sensitive to

884
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,918
methanoxan others are resistant

885
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,079
and here's a figure illustrating that

886
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,679
this is us-8 and these plates are

887
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,359
phytophthora infestations growing on an

888
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,080
agar medium with either 0 5 micrograms

889
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,240
per mil or 100 micrograms per mil of

890
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,079
methanoxan and you can see that there is

891
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,399
some effect of methanoxine on the growth

892
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,359
of us-8 but there's still significant

893
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:16,719
growth

894
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,439
of that

895
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,519
clonal lineage on methanoxin

896
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,278
but if you look at us-22

897
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,399
here's growth in the absence of

898
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,319
methanoxiem at five micrograms per mil

899
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,479
or at 100 micrograms per ml and it's

900
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,439
really severely

901
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
um

902
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,000
restricted by methanoxan this

903
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
we put a five millimeter plug on the

904
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,359
plate so that's just about the diameter

905
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,720
of the plug that we put on the plate

906
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:46,240
us-23 is similarly sensitive to

907
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,600
methanoxime and us-24 is generally

908
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,720
sensitive to methanoxin so that if you

909
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,959
have a methanoxane sensitive strain

910
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,240
then you can use that fungicide

911
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,600
and that could be really quite effective

912
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,240
it also turns out that there's

913
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
difference in terms of host

914
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,038
preference

915
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,799
and what this slide illustrates is the

916
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,559
amount of sporulation that's how many

917
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,079
sporangies are produced on a particular

918
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,000
leaflet

919
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,039
for the various clone lineages here's

920
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,760
us-8 us-22 us-23 and us-24

921
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,679
and whether sporulation is on potatoes

922
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,200
or on tomatoes

923
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,358
and what this graph illustrates is that

924
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,279
a us-8 is

925
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,440
actually a hell of a potato pathogen as

926
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,800
we already knew

927
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,639
but it doesn't do much at all to

928
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,039
tomatoes

929
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,200
us-22

930
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,519
does something on potatoes but look at

931
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,439
what it does on tomatoes it really is an

932
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,679
aggressive pathogen and reproduces very

933
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,240
rapidly on tomatoes

934
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,119
us-23 is even more aggressive on

935
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,519
potatoes than is us-22 and even more

936
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,240
aggressive on tomatoes

937
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,480
and then finally us-24

938
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,959
is somewhat similar to us-11 in that is

939
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,519
a good pathogen on potato sporulates

940
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,920
very profusely on potato but almost not

941
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,519
at all on tomato

942
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,559
and so it really is important are you

943
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,838
are you growing tomatoes or are you

944
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,039
going potatoes

945
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,719
which pathogen is near you

946
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,480
and actually you can learn which

947
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,480
pathogen is near you

948
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,079
because the um

949
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,920
in on the eastern

950
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,920
part of the united states the extension

951
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,119
personnel have collaborated on making

952
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,680
reports

953
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,880
as to whether late blight is present

954
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,719
and

955
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,880
they send those samples to our lab and

956
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,799
we assay those and we can identify to

957
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,440
clone a lineage very quickly

958
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,519
what that um

959
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,679
what that is and for example this is

960
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,759
from 2012 it's a summary

961
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,199
map of the united states from all of

962
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
2012.

963
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,598
and essentially everything we got

964
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,200
from

965
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,240
the northeast part of the united states

966
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,519
this last summer was u.s 23.

967
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,199
again it's

968
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:03,358
that's a really effective pathogen on

969
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,358
both potatoes and tomatoes

970
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,239
um

971
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,639
what we use now are micro satellite

972
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,399
markers to distinguish the

973
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,679
different lineages of phytophthora

974
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,680
infestands

975
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,639
and i have data for

976
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,879
2011 by the end of october 2011 we had

977
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,838
received at least 140 samples

978
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,880
and

979
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,039
we returned around at least 80 of those

980
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,358
within 24 to 48 hours so the person

981
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,320
sending the sample had an idea of what

982
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,319
of what was present

983
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,440
so what i think and what we're hoping

984
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,919
for is to develop a strain specific

985
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
forecast that will be available on the

986
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,559
decision support system and i think that

987
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,160
will enable people to become really very

988
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,559
um

989
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,480
very knowledgeable about what to do

990
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,880
so cultivar resistance and fungicide are

991
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
both huge

992
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
and this is a picture of some field

993
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,519
experiments looking at cultivars at

994
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,799
freeville this is really a beautiful

995
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,358
image don't you think

996
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,960
um ian small took this image ian has

997
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,880
been working really hard

998
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
um and he is i think it's really a

999
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,640
gorgeous image i think he was there

1000
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,880
early in the morning to go fishing

1001
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,199
because the um fall creek is right there

1002
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
and ian is really an avid fisherman so i

1003
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,358
think this is even

1004
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,358
but be that as it may we have a fair

1005
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,519
amount of date about host resistance

1006
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,799
for both potatoes and

1007
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,280
tomatoes

1008
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,240
this is a disease progress curve for a

1009
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,560
susceptible cultivar and what the

1010
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,838
y-axis illustrates is the amount of

1011
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,960
disease that goes up to 100 which is all

1012
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,480
death and this is time along the x-axis

1013
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,800
and you see in a susceptible cultivar

1014
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,838
you get this very rapid increase in

1015
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,640
disease

1016
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,000
for a moderately resistant cultivar

1017
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,000
under the same weather conditions the

1018
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,280
same inoculation condition to get much

1019
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,358
less disease

1020
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,680
so that's that's really important

1021
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,159
fungicides obviously are really

1022
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,519
important these vertical blue lines

1023
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,039
illustrate

1024
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,639
the um

1025
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,559
the dates at which a fungicide was

1026
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,239
applied so if fungus is applied to a

1027
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,039
susceptible cultivar you can suppress

1028
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,399
disease quite significantly with with

1029
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,000
with fungicide

1030
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
but a moderately resistant cultivar

1031
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
doesn't need as much fungicide as a

1032
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,400
susceptible one or put it the other way

1033
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,159
a susceptible cultivar needs a lot more

1034
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,519
fungicide than does a moderately

1035
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,920
resistant one

1036
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,838
the dss now has

1037
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,599
cultivars by name and their their

1038
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,719
category of resistance

1039
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,640
at least 75 or at least 75 cultivars for

1040
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,399
potatoes and we're in the process of

1041
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,400
doing tomatoes but there are at least 50

1042
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,119
cultivars of tomatoes that we can put

1043
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,079
into the dss

1044
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,400
in terms of fungicides

1045
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,400
this is

1046
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,320
there's there's been also a tremendous

1047
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,679
amount of work this is a picture from

1048
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,559
this last year

1049
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,239
um

1050
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,320
the the experiment this year had at

1051
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,319
least 15 types there were several

1052
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,838
different combinations applied to two

1053
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,000
different tomato cultivars and two

1054
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,480
different potato cultivars for something

1055
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,159
like 70 treatments which was a

1056
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,240
tremendous amount

1057
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,319
but we use that information to put into

1058
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,598
the dss and here's uh you don't have to

1059
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,240
look at the you don't understand this

1060
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,240
slide but it illustrates how we use that

1061
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,919
information of different fungicides in

1062
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:20,799
terms of a disease forecast

1063
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,280
and this uh is a picture of steve mckay

1064
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,400
who is doing the fungicide applications

1065
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,839
and steve

1066
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,480
was driving that tractor

1067
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:34,000
about 15 miles an hour between plots

1068
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,000
the boom was bouncing all over

1069
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,960
but steve

1070
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,759
it's my pleasure to recognize you today

1071
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
for

1072
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,079
steve's really significant contribution

1073
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,519
in terms of

1074
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,440
all the kinds of research that goes on

1075
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,199
out at freeville

1076
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,639
that he gets the

1077
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:54,239
2011 excellence in ipm award

1078
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,039
yeah i think anything else would be sort

1079
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,439
of

1080
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,679
anti-climactic so let me uh i'll skip

1081
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,679
this

1082
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,359
it's really cool but i'll skip it

1083
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,119
okay so i think that with potato late

1084
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,519
blight management i think

1085
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,119
highly localized management this is

1086
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,800
that's really targeted it's like

1087
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
personalized medicine is for your farm

1088
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,760
for your for that field for that

1089
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,959
particular cultivar

1090
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,800
uh will be really effective for 2013

1091
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,960
what we hope to do

1092
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,079
is to include

1093
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,519
sort of a targeted forecast which also

1094
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,318
brings into account the pathogen

1095
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:32,559
presence or the lineage that's near you

1096
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,000
and i think that should be able to uh

1097
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,838
really help out

1098
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,639
disease management and finally i'd like

1099
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,719
to say thanks to people in my group

1100
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,400
kevin myers who

1101
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,639
is right back there

1102
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,200
has done all of the microsats

1103
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,199
and people all over the east coast

1104
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,598
know kevin very well at least

1105
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,559
electronically ian small has been doing

1106
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,039
the

1107
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,759
work on the dss which is wonderful

1108
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,639
laura joseph is programmer who is just

1109
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,440
amazing and giovanna danis is the person

1110
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,519
who identified the

1111
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,760
characteristics of

1112
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,440
the strains of phytophthora infestands

1113
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,640
and so with that i'll quit

1114
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,119
and if there are any questions i'll give

1115
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,118
them to steve

1116
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,280
we would all love to know that the

1117
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,480
answer to that question and we're we're

1118
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,079
working on it

1119
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,760
um

1120
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,000
yeah so everybody wants to know where

1121
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,400
are these things coming from and uh

1122
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,039
yeah um

1123
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,119
i think it was present in florida prior

1124
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,960
to 2009

1125
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,240
um but where it came before it was in

1126
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,838
florida we don't know okay so there's a

1127
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,919
twofold answer to that

1128
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:51,039
um the first is that in 2009 us-22 was

1129
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,159
spread throughout the u.s by

1130
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,920
on infected tomato transplants so it was

1131
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,879
just everywhere

1132
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,119
it's not as aggressive as us-23 so we're

1133
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,280
seeing it subside in in terms of its

1134
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,400
prevalence and i think

1135
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,720
um

1136
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,440
so both things contribute you know

1137
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,759
widespread distribution is huge

1138
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,280
but aggressiveness can also uh make a

1139
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
difference and so us 23 is more

1140
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,560
aggressive it's

1141
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,078
it's really going everywhere us 22 is

1142
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,799
subsiding

1143
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,240
um what we do when we have infected

1144
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,318
plants we don't we're not worried about

1145
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:28,479
we get we put them um into

1146
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,559
black garbage bags

1147
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,318
and let them heat up during the summer

1148
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,559
and die that way

1149
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,599
so um that's what we can do on a small

1150
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,199
scale

1151
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,160
but as far as we know again knock on

1152
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,199
wood that that um

1153
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,118
we don't think there's sexual

1154
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,679
reproduction yet in the united states so

1155
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,440
i think the soil itself is not a

1156
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,279
reservoir of this pathogen if there are

1157
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,800
infected tubers or there are other

1158
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,280
infected plants somewhere that they

1159
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,640
could be but we think you know osports

1160
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,400
in the soil are not a source of the

1161
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,440
pathogen as far as we know

1162
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,160
growers do a lot of things um

1163
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,559
some growers have used flame throwers to

1164
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,078
destroy uh plants

1165
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,400
um

1166
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,760
they've sprayed a lot of fungicide they

1167
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,280
after they've

1168
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,720
they disk them up

1169
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,720
what you want to do is get them get that

1170
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,639
plant as dead as you can as quickly as

1171
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,639
possible so the pathogen then dies

1172
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,680
if there are two mating types in

1173
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,440
phytophthora infestands if they come

1174
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,719
physically in contact

1175
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,800
there's sexual reproduction is likely

1176
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,919
because we have clonal populations at

1177
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
this point

1178
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,079
even though we have both mating types in

1179
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,078
the u.s we have one clone of one mating

1180
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,920
type over there and one clone of a

1181
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,160
different mating type over here and we

1182
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,240
don't think they interact that much and

1183
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,559
i think that's why we haven't seen

1184
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,879
uh sexual recombination yet although

1185
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,199
both mating types exist in the states

1186
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,160
that's a com the answer is complicated

1187
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,679
to that

1188
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,000
um

1189
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,039
with the sort of multi-genic resistance

1190
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,480
that we've been focusing on we don't see

1191
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,239
any lineage specific effect

1192
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,838
if there's single arginine resistance

1193
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,598
and yes there can be quite significant

1194
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,519
differential effect

1195
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,680
but at this point

1196
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,519
ph2 and ph3

1197
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,838
are resistance genes that

1198
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,079
seem to be holding up at the moment

1199
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,239
and there are a few tomato cultivars

1200
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,160
with those resistance genes and against

1201
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,318
this population of phytophthora infest

1202
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,519
hands they are immune

1203
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,000
you know how long we'll have this

1204
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,480
population of phytophthora infestan is

1205
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,480
anybody's

1206
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,559
guess this has been a production of

1207
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:43,559
cornell university on the web at

1208
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,559
cornell.edu
