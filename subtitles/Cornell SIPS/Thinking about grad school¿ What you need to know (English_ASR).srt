00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,290
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:06,000
University

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,309
hey guys and I've got a few things I

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,708
want to go through but mostly this is

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:14,518
just information for you so if you have

6
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:16,410
questions at any time you know stop I'll

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,750
be happy to talk as much as you guys

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,698
want about any particular topic so

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,730
basically I'll start telling you a

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,410
little bit about myself so

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,969
you know my family didn't have a lot of

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,439
people that went to college you know we

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,509
had a few that ended up in nursing

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,820
school but certainly nobody went to grad

15
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,480
school so I was really interested in

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,189
science in high school I loved biology

17
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,750
what do you do when you like science in

18
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,729
high school right I didn't know so I

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,049
thought okay I'll try to be a doctor

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,538
because that's what you do and you don't

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,269
know anything about academia or research

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,370
or science so I went to school you know

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,899
thinking I was a pre-med and then the

24
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,339
more I get into it the more I learned

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,370
the more I thought well maybe that's not

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,769
for me so I volunteered in a hospital

27
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,189
and at the same time I got a job working

28
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:03,570
in a lab on campus doing research with

29
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:05,728
streptococcus mutans which probably most

30
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,459
of you have in your mouth right now

31
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,670
causes cavities hopefully not in your

32
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,438
mouth right now and I absolutely loved

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,420
the microbiology research and I

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,548
absolutely hated working in the hospital

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm still not really fond of hospitals

36
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,020
and so the idea of being a doctor it

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,100
just was like no way and but the more I

38
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,709
got into the research the more I

39
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,539
realized I loved it and so then you know

40
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,728
from there it's like I got an advisor

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,649
and I was working with somebody in the

42
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,078
lab you know professor was very helpful

43
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:36,118
and he said yeah you know there's lots

44
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,188
of things you can do with a PhD in

45
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,469
microbiology you know you can do all of

46
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,639
these interesting things and so I went

47
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,019
to grad school and I didn't think I

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,368
wanted to be a professor when I went to

49
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,679
grad school I thought I wanted to work

50
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:48,899
in the biotech industry in particular I

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,149
wanted to clean up contamination in the

52
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,829
environment using microbes but then as I

53
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,269
learned more about myself and as I

54
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,209
learned more about microbiology I

55
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,500
realized I was really fascinated in

56
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:01,288
microbial ecology and what happens in

57
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,180
soils and that basically led me to our

58
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,799
am today and so that's part of the

59
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,659
process of like deciding if you want to

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,819
go to grad school or figuring out what

61
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,340
you want to do right now is getting

62
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,180
experiences so getting internships like

63
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,280
maybe

64
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,829
the Botanical Garden or somewhere else

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,229
you know taking time to figure out what

66
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:20,610
excites you and narrowing down the list

67
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,169
of things you want to do with your life

68
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,459
right I mean that's hopefully what you

69
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,719
guys are thinking about right now and

70
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,459
maybe I'll be able to help you a little

71
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,930
bit but my job today is mostly to give

72
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,819
you some idea about what grad school is

73
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,760
all about and if you're interested in it

74
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,929
how you might get in

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:39,378
so there's a few things I want to cover

76
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,489
what is grad school all about

77
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:44,489
why would you want to go to grad school

78
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,019
what you can do to prepare to go to grad

79
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,959
school and then how that whole

80
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,049
admissions process works and I'll sort

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,829
of take them on in that order so

82
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:57,650
what is grad school grad school is

83
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,329
it's basically

84
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,370
training to become good at doing

85
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,560
research right grad school is much more

86
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,230
focused than undergraduate so an

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,519
undergraduate you're doing credits you

88
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,988
know you're taking courses primarily

89
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,158
they're other things you're doing of

90
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,408
course but you're getting your degree

91
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,328
because of the coursework and credits

92
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:16,858
that you're taking you know there's 120

93
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,260
credits you got to take and you got to

94
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:21,120
satisfy all these criteria that doesn't

95
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,280
really exist in grad school grad school

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,109
is about doing some kind of original

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,269
research right it's like finding

98
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,699
something where you're going to make an

99
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,069
individual impact in a new way and yes

100
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,989
you take courses in grad school but

101
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:36,119
they're very flexible and there aren't

102
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,199
many of them it's mostly focused on a

103
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,879
real practical experience alerting

104
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,560
exercise and the real goal of grad

105
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,328
school you know you're gonna have some

106
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,000
focused area that you're becoming an

107
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,919
expert in but the real unifying theme is

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,959
you're learning how to learn you're

109
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,729
learning how to how to design research

110
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,128
how to perform research and how to

111
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,510
answer a question that it's not

112
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:59,189
something you can just look up in a book

113
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,750
right there's lots of questions out

114
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,848
there that we don't have the answers to

115
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,859
going to grad school is getting the

116
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,388
skills it takes to be able to answer

117
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,859
those questions you just can't look up

118
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,879
in a textbook so maybe you can write

119
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,799
your own textbook someday

120
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,388
so in terms of grad school there's a few

121
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,470
different degrees you might hear about

122
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,319
or think about there's a MPS degree

123
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,040
which is a master's of

124
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,740
professionals these professional service

125
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,510
studies

126
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,660
this is a little bit less common in the

127
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:34,089
sciences typically it's more coursework

128
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,270
focused it's usually a shorter program

129
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,459
one or two years and usually it's for

130
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:42,399
somebody you know if you're interested

131
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:45,879
in going into industry and you want to

132
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:48,159
be a CEO for a company that makes

133
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,069
fertilizer or one of these big AG

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,830
biotech companies like Bayer crop

135
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:56,170
sciences or something like that and you

136
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:58,180
know you're gonna be a manager but you

137
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,310
really want to know a lot about soil

138
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,110
science so you can understand what the

139
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,750
people who work for you are doing that

140
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,850
might make sense to do an NPS in soil

141
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,949
science for example so you're focusing

142
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,870
on a particular area to improve your

143
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,610
knowledge in that area but you're not

144
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,389
going to go on to be a professor in that

145
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:19,170
topic right it's much more focused

146
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:22,329
master's degree is

147
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,890
very much still a research degree you

148
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:26,709
know but what you're doing there is sort

149
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,050
of learning how to be a scientist maybe

150
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:31,359
more than learning how to direct a

151
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,520
research program so if you want to be

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,500
able to direct a research program either

153
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,490
in industry or academia you really need

154
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,230
the PhD so the PhD is sort of like

155
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,000
you know you're able to identify new

156
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,420
research topics design a research

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,250
program to answer that question

158
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,020
get the funding to do it manage it and

159
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,490
then get a positive outcome whereas with

160
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:54,099
a master's degree it's more like well

161
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,139
you're able to do research but you might

162
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,180
not be in a position to sort of come up

163
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,360
with new ideas or sort of direct the

164
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,069
whole research program

165
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,250
any questions about those sort of

166
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,199
different degrees a

167
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,980
master's is usually two maybe three

168
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,079
years a PhD can vary the fastest I've

169
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,910
seen somebody finishes like four and a

170
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,329
half years and the longest I've seen

171
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,860
somebody take was eight years

172
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,719
eight year student spent a lot of time

173
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,310
abroad and he did lots of interesting

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,310
things so he was using his time well

175
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,030
that's a good question so

176
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,220
so

177
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:36,869
that varies by field and so what I'll

178
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,820
and so there are there are slight

179
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,379
cultural differences and practices

180
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,139
across different fields so if you're a

181
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,860
microbiologist or a plant biologist or a

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,529
chemist

183
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,600
you're gonna see some differences so in

184
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,939
general the way I like to describe it is

185
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,770
if you're in a laboratory based

186
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,509
environment like you're doing bench work

187
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,519
in the lab all day those people

188
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,740
typically go right from the bachelor's

189
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,959
degree to a PhD right they don't usually

190
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,329
get a masters whereas people who do

191
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,969
field work you know either ecology

192
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:07,560
Natural Resources Plant Sciences those

193
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,810
people it's more likely that you're

194
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,509
going to get a master's degree before

195
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,699
you get the PhD and it might be more

196
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,409
expected that you do so plant science is

197
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,029
kind of funny because we've got the some

198
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,850
of the plant biologists or like doing

199
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,679
genomics in the lab all day and then

200
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,420
we've got people in horticulture who are

201
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,579
out in the field all day and so you're

202
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,199
generally gonna see you know those field

203
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,629
people it's more common that they'll

204
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,490
have a master's before the PhD whereas

205
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,409
the bench people it's almost exciting

206
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,269
almost

207
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,490
consistently everybody just gets the PhD

208
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,769
without a master's so to some degree it

209
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,360
varies and I and my own personal I don't

210
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:45,479
have never heard a good explanation for

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,509
why that is but the best guess I have is

212
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,360
that if you're in a if you're in a bench

213
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,879
science program you know most of those

214
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,800
research jobs

215
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,870
tend to be directing research rather

216
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,730
than performing it and so if you want a

217
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,470
direct research you need a PhD and so a

218
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,660
master's degree isn't quite as

219
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,700
marketable if you're in a bench type

220
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,560
environment whereas in those field based

221
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,449
environments there are many more sort of

222
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,639
management level positions whether with

223
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,560
government or extension where that

224
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,539
master's degree is a pretty marketable

225
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,910
thing and so I feel like it's kind of

226
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,340
market driven but yeah that is what it

227
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,750
is but so if you have an adviser if

228
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,489
you're thinking about grad school you

229
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,199
know in a particular area that you know

230
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,850
you should ask or try to figure out what

231
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,849
the particulars are for that area

232
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,750
so why might you want to go to grad

233
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,750
school

234
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,960
number one you should you know in the

235
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,408
sciences you should really like science

236
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,649
and really be interested in research but

237
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:46,838
there are some other good reasons so

238
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,639
there's a good reason in terms of salary

239
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,709
if that sort of thing is interested

240
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,278
interesting to you you know there's sort

241
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:57,099
of this old saw out there that you know

242
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,778
if you get too much education it's hard

243
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,730
to get a job or maybe you educate

244
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:03,159
yourself out of a job and that's not

245
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,080
true so if you look at the statistics

246
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,500
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

247
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,120
which are national u.s. statistics if

248
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,470
you got a if you get a doctoral degree

249
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,730
not a medical degree but a PhD

250
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,160
over your lifetime you're likely to get

251
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,610
43 percent more salary than if you just

252
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,309
have a bachelor's alone and the

253
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,639
unemployment rate at least as of 2015

254
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:29,349
for people with a PhD is 1.7 percent

255
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,299
which is about a third of the

256
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,330
unemployment rate for people who have a

257
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,859
bachelor's so if you have a PhD you're

258
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,860
more employable and you're going to earn

259
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,950
more money if that matters to you and

260
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,259
even with a master's the unemployment

261
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,850
rate for a master's is 2.4 percent which

262
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,429
is like half of the unemployment right

263
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,870
right now for everybody else and even

264
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,519
with a master's you're gonna get 18

265
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,250
percent higher salary over your lifetime

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,799
than someone just with a bachelor's so

267
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,419
if you're interested in science you know

268
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,159
if you're thinking about you know these

269
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:02,169
things are important to you yeah it's a

270
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,850
good idea to think about grad school the

271
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:06,939
other thing is in the sciences it's

272
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,700
mostly free right so if you go to get a

273
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,709
PhD if you go to get a masters or a

274
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,709
research degree at a university

275
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,550
generally you're going to get your

276
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,709
tuition covered so your tuition is going

277
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,870
to be paid for by the program or by a

278
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,609
fellowship or some other method maybe a

279
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,500
teaching assistantship and you're going

280
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,970
to actually get paid to go to school so

281
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,559
you're gonna get a living stipend it's

282
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,329
not a ton of money but it's enough to

283
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,739
pay all your bills and cover your health

284
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,359
insurance and everything you need while

285
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,919
you're in school so it's a pretty good

286
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,470
deal you end up with getting your

287
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,389
education paid for you also end up

288
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,430
making more money over your lifetime and

289
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,389
you have a low unemployment rate so if

290
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,489
you think it's something you're

291
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,460
interested in you know it can be a good

292
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,509
choice

293
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,509
any questions about all that stuff

294
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,250
alright so then the other thing is how

295
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,100
do you prepare right so what can you do

296
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,419
to prepare for grad school

297
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,159
in terms of preparing for grad school

298
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,229
and in terms of your application I mean

299
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,689
there are really three things that you

300
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,830
want to think about

301
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,960
one of the things is your coursework

302
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,060
right you've guys have already picked

303
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,680
majors you're thinking about majors

304
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,449
you're thinking about your concentration

305
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,789
probably if you're in the plant sciences

306
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,740
major and so that's going to really

307
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:26,379
dictate your coursework so that

308
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,419
coursework is of course important but

309
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:31,059
probably the single most important thing

310
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,849
in terms of grad school is is real-world

311
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:36,189
experience so like in my case you know I

312
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,840
volunteered in that Hospital I did that

313
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,280
research in the lab you know I joined

314
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,290
the lab as a junior and I worked

315
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,149
throughout my junior and senior years

316
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:45,779
and I had one whole summer where I was

317
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,889
working on the research

318
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,799
real-world experiences so like

319
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,750
internships

320
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,599
you know working in the lab independent

321
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,580
research credits honors project it

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
doesn't have to be just in one lab but

323
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,259
but those experiences are going to help

324
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,790
you to know you know what you like and

325
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,549
what interests you but they're also

326
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,599
going to really help to

327
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,849
give you the skills you're going to need

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,860
and sort of develop your background so

329
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,790
that you can get into graduate school if

330
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,789
that's a choice you want to make

331
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:18,789
and then the other thing to mention

332
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,610
there in terms of real-world experiences

333
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:24,730
a lot of people like to take a gap year

334
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,769
so so you get your bachelor's and then

335
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,149
maybe you're not ready to go right into

336
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:33,009
grad school or maybe for some reason

337
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:35,079
you know you think there's something you

338
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,210
can improve about your preparation for

339
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,220
grad school so a lot of people will get

340
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,500
a job you know it could be a job as a

341
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,960
technician it could be a job on a farm

342
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,639
some people go into the Peace Corps you

343
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,740
know those sorts of experiences if

344
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,970
they're related to your area of interest

345
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,320
you know if they're related to your

346
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,778
professional sort of educational goals

347
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,640
and why you're going to grad school

348
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,889
those kind of experiences are generally

349
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,269
going to help you write because when

350
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,220
you're making an application for grad

351
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,500
school those people want to know are you

352
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,009
really interested in this do you have

353
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,870
skills and so you're gonna develop that

354
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,490
interest and get those skills not just

355
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,669
in the classroom and so those real-world

356
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,049
experiences are really important and you

357
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,599
know if you're a freshman if you're a

358
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,799
sophomore it's definitely a good time to

359
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,690
be thinking about it if you're a

360
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,899
transfer student coming in maybe later

361
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,339
on definitely you want to try to get you

362
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,980
know some of those experiences as soon

363
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,850
as possible when there are lots of

364
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,850
different ways to do that

365
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,899
so the other thing I wanted to talk

366
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:43,759
about is admissions but before I start

367
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,889
talking about admissions you guys are

368
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,199
really quiet and I know you must have

369
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:50,089
some questions so does somebody because

370
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:51,439
I and I know that if you have a question

371
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,290
there are probably ten people in the

372
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,490
room who have the same question so it

373
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,599
would be really helpful maybe if

374
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,600
somebody would ask yeah

375
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:13,338
so you you're asking the question from

376
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,039
the point from your point of view like

377
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,810
where do I want to send my application

378
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,208
yeah that's a great question so yeah

379
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,799
there's a ton of programs out there and

380
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,138
it can be hard to navigate and I would

381
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,838
say the first thing you need to do is

382
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,419
figure out what you want you know what

383
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,769
are your interests you know that that

384
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,328
old question that people ask you that

385
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,528
you hate to get what you want to do what

386
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:35,028
do you want to be doing in 10 years

387
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:37,159
right

388
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,838
you know you need the first thing you

389
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,299
need to do is be answer to answer that

390
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,730
question real well it's hard right and

391
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,379
that's why I say get experiences because

392
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,930
getting those experiences will help you

393
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,909
to answer that question you know you

394
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,649
have to know who you are before you know

395
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:54,889
where you want to go so if you have that

396
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:56,480
bit ready you know then I guess there

397
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,919
would be two things to do the first and

398
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,120
probably most valuable thing is

399
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:03,500
hopefully you've been working with

400
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,139
somebody in the lab maybe that's a

401
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,839
graduate student maybe it's a professor

402
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:11,149
maybe it's your academic adviser but

403
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,339
you've got somebody in a in a sort of

404
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,958
mentor kind of relationship you know

405
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,240
maybe it's Marvin here in this class

406
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,698
right but you've got somebody who you

407
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,230
can talk to who has a network right

408
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:23,448
they're a professional they know the

409
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,938
area if you go to that person and you

410
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:27,919
say hey I'm really interested in this

411
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:29,448
area of study you know they're going to

412
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,948
be able to tell you probably off the top

413
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:32,628
of your head okay here's half a dozen

414
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:34,849
programs you might think about applying

415
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:36,709
to and even if they don't they probably

416
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,920
know somebody who could give you that

417
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:41,179
list right so so tap into that network

418
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,519
when you when you're sort of doing

419
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,769
research you're developing a network of

420
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,889
professionals so tap into your network

421
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,889
and them and they'll provide you really

422
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:52,689
good information yeah and if there are

423
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,220
other people you're working with you

424
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,560
know whether it's an internship or in a

425
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,620
lab you know the graduate students ask

426
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,869
them to write so you know sort of canvas

427
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,879
your your network and get information

428
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,590
and then the other thing is as you're

429
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,360
as you're interested in this area you

430
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,680
should be reading so as you get more and

431
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,700
more interested you want to do more and

432
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,009
more reading and if you're doing

433
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,440
research you're probably getting papers

434
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:19,509
to read maybe you're seeing scientific

435
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,390
papers and your classes or maybe you're

436
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,620
just reading stuff from the internet so

437
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,330
those articles are going to talk about

438
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
the science but you're also gonna see

439
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,259
the names of people who made those

440
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,240
discoveries write those names down write

441
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,700
when you see an article that has a

442
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,500
really exciting conclusion who's the

443
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,990
senior author on that you know what

444
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,029
institution are they at so keep a list

445
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,620
of the kinds of stuff that you find

446
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,509
exciting and then who did the work and

447
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,740
where are they maybe they're all the

448
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,750
people doing this work or at the

449
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,740
University of Minnesota or something you

450
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,110
know that's something you want to know

451
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,580
so if you're reading a lot of papers and

452
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,320
you find that all the papers you're

453
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,090
excited about are written by like five

454
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,710
people you should probably apply the

455
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,470
institution's for those five people are

456
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,269
at write so those are really good and

457
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,350
then the web you know and then you look

458
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,389
online that can be harder but you know

459
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,949
if you look for plant science programs

460
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,440
you know not every place in the country

461
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,210
has one so you find the ones that do if

462
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,940
you're interested in a particular area

463
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,329
you know look at the faculty bios and

464
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,220
find a place like you might look at the

465
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,599
Michigan State and if you're interested

466
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,730
in a particular area maybe they have

467
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,049
only one person really specializing and

468
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,329
when you read their background it looks

469
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,669
really lame and maybe you look at UC

470
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,710
Davis and they have five people in that

471
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,690
area and they're all really dynamic

472
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,370
right then you'd want to make that

473
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,529
application there so I would say use

474
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,779
your network you know do some reading

475
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,269
you know and then and then do that sort

476
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,490
of web-based search

477
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:47,819
yeah good question

478
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,819
you got a question

479
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,360
so that's tricky right so so there are a

480
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:55,329
couple

481
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:57,189
so funding is one of the big things and

482
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,750
we could talk a lot a long time about

483
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,450
this and it's an important thing for

484
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,910
grad school because you do get funded to

485
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,009
go to grad school but whether or not

486
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,990
that funding comes through is one of the

487
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,789
big things that dictates whether or not

488
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,309
you get accepted so when you're getting

489
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,990
accepted to an undergraduate program

490
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,359
mostly they're looking at like your

491
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,339
merit you know your your GPA the

492
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,409
coursework you did you know they're

493
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,449
looking at like that whole piece and

494
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,400
that's certainly important for grad

495
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,350
school but it's only one of the pieces

496
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,630
for grad school you know this funding

497
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:30,549
piece is really important because we

498
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,470
don't have unlimited funding we can't

499
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,049
just I'll pay for anybody to go to

500
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,450
school and so we have to sort of figure

501
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,240
out how to provide that money for you

502
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,279
and so so really in the bigger picture

503
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,620
there's three ways right there's

504
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,109
fellowships there's teaching

505
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:50,739
assistantships and then there are

506
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:52,089
faculty grants and and these all three

507
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,490
of these are the mechanisms we used to

508
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,509
fund students and

509
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,430
when you're admitted you might be

510
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,559
admitted with one kind of support but

511
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,560
over the course of a PhD you might

512
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,480
actually move between all three and if I

513
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,980
admit ten students it's unlikely that

514
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,579
all ten of those students will have the

515
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:13,450
same kind of funding package so with

516
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:15,939
fellowships there are two basic kinds I

517
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,610
would say there's kinds that you apply

518
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,650
for and they're the kinds that the

519
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:23,199
school you're applying to will nominate

520
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,759
you for so the ones that you apply for

521
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,890
you have control over but there aren't a

522
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,299
ton of them so there's like the biggest

523
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,060
one that you guys should all know about

524
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:35,079
is the National Science Foundation

525
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:38,289
graduate fellowship program so that's a

526
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,389
really big program it's competitive but

527
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,740
if you get funded there it's fantastic

528
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,910
right you can almost guarantee that

529
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,220
you're going to get accepted anywhere

530
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,350
you apply if you get one of these NSF

531
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,240
fellowships

532
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:51,639
the due dates are usually in the fall so

533
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,900
you want to plan ahead but I would very

534
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,340
much if you think about going to grad

535
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,780
school you really want to look at this

536
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:57,399
and think carefully about making an

537
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,529
application but there are other things

538
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,288
like the Ford Foundation has fellowship

539
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:05,450
program I

540
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:07,638
notice USAID still have fellowship

541
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,899
programs but there's a lot of programs

542
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:11,629
out there and you sort of have to look

543
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:13,518
around they tend to be specialized NSF

544
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,909
is very broad but but there are a lot of

545
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,380
specialized programs I want to say the

546
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:20,419
armed services have some fellowship

547
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,269
programs maybe than some of the national

548
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,740
labs do so you have to hunt around the

549
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,870
one I would recommend because it's broad

550
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,240
and almost anybody could apply for it is

551
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,979
the NSF program so if you apply for your

552
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,169
own funding and you get that from that

553
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,339
external agency that travels with you no

554
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,480
matter where you go and that's fantastic

555
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:41,298
short of that you don't have to have

556
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,190
that you can apply to school the school

557
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:45,019
can nominate you for a fellowship like

558
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,850
an internal fellowship so Cornell has a

559
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:50,329
lot of internal fellowships we use for

560
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:51,918
recruiting purposes and so like as the

561
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:53,750
director of Graduate Studies I get your

562
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,250
application if I see your application

563
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,769
I'm like oh this would be a great

564
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,690
candidate for this funding you know I'm

565
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,329
gonna nominate you for that you won't

566
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,639
even know I nominated you for that if

567
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,960
they don't accept you then okay I'll try

568
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,668
to fund you some other way but if they

569
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,440
do then I'll send you a letter that says

570
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,909
congratulations you know you've received

571
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,759
this fellowship you know please come to

572
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,590
Cornell so you don't necessarily know

573
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,139
that that's happening but that's one way

574
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:20,240
that we could fund you so that's sort of

575
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:23,479
fellowships and then the teaching

576
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,788
assistantship so faculty teach we teach

577
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,370
courses and so we need assistance with

578
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:31,099
that and so teaching assistantships are

579
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:32,959
a way that the university pays graduate

580
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:35,089
students so that for some of their time

581
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,190
they're helping with teaching and it's

582
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,798
capped at how many hours a week you can

583
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,110
be expected to be teaching I think the

584
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,480
maximum is like 15 hours for most

585
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:46,729
assignments in reality you spend

586
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,000
spending a lot less time than that

587
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,980
actually teaching but but that would be

588
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,308
a way to sort of pay your salary and

589
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,870
tuition as well in the sciences you do a

590
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:59,329
little bit less of that if you are in

591
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,369
the humanities they actually usually

592
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:04,699
have to that they don't have as many

593
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,199
fellowships and and grants as we do in

594
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,769
the sciences usually and so they can

595
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,179
spend a lot more teaching but but ta

596
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,160
ships aren't that onerous in the

597
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,870
sciences you but so that's one way I

598
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,870
might be able to provide your funding is

599
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:20,239
my unit might have five or six ta lines

600
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,729
and so that means five or six people I

601
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,839
can support with those ta lines and

602
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,849
again you wouldn't know anything about

603
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,409
that you're gonna make the application I

604
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,329
know I have so many slots I'm gonna try

605
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,820
to put people in them and then the

606
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:34,210
faculty grants so Cornell doesn't give

607
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:37,009
faculty any money

608
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,500
to do research right they give us space

609
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,059
and offices but that's it

610
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,440
when we get hired they give us some

611
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,210
money to buy equipment but then they

612
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,590
don't give us any more money so after

613
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,539
that if you want to do research you need

614
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:51,109
to get grants so National Science

615
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:54,230
Foundation USDA AG and food research

616
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,179
initiative Department of Energy you know

617
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,099
NASA

618
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,750
you know international agencies we need

619
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:02,149
to hustle to get grant money to support

620
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,599
our research the biggest component of

621
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:08,000
that money is usually people you know

622
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,429
it's salaries its tuition its health

623
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,259
insurance and so that's how we pay for a

624
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,509
lot of grad students so but that's

625
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,579
tricky because many of these funding

626
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:18,529
programs might reject ninety percent of

627
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:20,929
the applications that you make and so a

628
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:23,450
faculty member is constantly submitting

629
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,830
grant applications and they can't always

630
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,740
predict when and want is going to be

631
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:30,019
funded and maybe to get funded just by

632
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,910
chance right so one year that faculty

633
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,529
member might need to admit to students

634
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,210
and then the next year they might admit

635
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:38,359
none or maybe three years in a row they

636
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,069
might admit none so so that's a source

637
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,240
of funding but it's also somewhat

638
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:43,369
unpredictable so when you make an

639
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,569
application you know I can't tell you

640
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,909
where your money is going to come from

641
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:49,159
but I need to have a source of money to

642
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,870
admit you whether it's a fellowship or a

643
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,840
teaching assistantship or a faculty

644
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:55,099
grant

645
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,509
and there's a lot that goes on there so

646
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,959
I'm happy to answer any follow-up

647
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,960
questions

648
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,999
any other questions

649
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,558
good so in terms of then in terms of

650
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:16,368
Admissions and getting into graduate

651
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:19,450
school I would say that really there are

652
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:23,418
sort of three pieces to that

653
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,419
the the one piece is sort of the merit

654
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,028
of the applicant

655
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:30,350
sort of what you bring to the equation

656
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:31,089
the second piece is something I would

657
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,428
call

658
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:35,778
your fit with the program and the third

659
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,980
piece is the funding and I think we

660
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:39,109
already talked a little bit about the

661
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,139
funding funding is usually a big

662
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:45,038
constraint so I would say that you know

663
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:48,048
we usually get more applicants

664
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,249
who are who are high quality and and the

665
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:50,918
other thing I would say is that at the

666
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:54,558
graduate level

667
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,909
you know if you if I if I think there's

668
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:57,470
a reasonable likelihood that you're

669
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:59,629
gonna be successful in graduate school

670
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,220
I'd like to be able to admit you right I

671
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:03,168
mean obviously we use merit as a

672
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,589
criteria we want the best and brightest

673
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,600
but but really I'm only going to exclude

674
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:10,069
you for sure if I don't think you're

675
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,178
gonna be successful in graduate school

676
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:14,210
if I think you're going to be successful

677
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,710
I want to try to admit you and so but

678
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,749
the reason I can't admit everybody is

679
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,278
usually funding right so funding puts a

680
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,200
cap on who we can admit and then we're

681
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,319
trying to admit the people who have the

682
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,940
highest merit and have the best fit and

683
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,599
we can talk about merit in a second but

684
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,740
this fit thing is interesting because

685
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,109
you know gets back to the question you

686
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,769
had earlier about where do you apply

687
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:38,329
right so let's say you know maybe you

688
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,159
didn't do your homework when you decided

689
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,048
where to apply and you applied to a

690
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,639
university and you're really interested

691
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:47,528
in let's say you're really interested in

692
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:50,329
using drones to you know measure

693
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:52,759
plant health in some way right which is

694
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:54,349
a cool thing to do and you apply to a

695
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,990
university where there's absolutely

696
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:58,969
nobody working with drones right and

697
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,980
they look at your application and

698
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,079
they're like holy crap this person has

699
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,628
an NSF fellowship you know they have a

700
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,460
4.0 GPA they've got this wonderful

701
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:09,108
internship and they want to work with

702
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,999
drones we don't have anybody doing

703
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:12,419
anything with drones do you think they

704
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:14,559
should admit you

705
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,870
they probably would not be doing you any

706
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,700
favors by admitting you because if they

707
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,839
admit you they might they might admit

708
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,549
you because you're just a great

709
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,409
applicant you have your own money and

710
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:24,669
they might hope that they could convince

711
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,070
you to work on something other than

712
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,509
drones but if they don't have a faculty

713
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,039
member working on drones and if that's

714
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,329
what your heart beats for you really

715
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,329
have no business going to that school

716
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:36,039
right so they should reject you because

717
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:38,919
there's no fit they don't have somebody

718
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,569
who can properly advise you and direct

719
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,910
you and mentor you in the area that

720
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:44,889
makes you excited you know what you're

721
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,290
trying to learn and so I would say that

722
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,490
in general

723
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,930
fit is important so if you're applying

724
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,660
to a school and they don't have

725
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,400
expertise in that area

726
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,230
that can be a problem so more often what

727
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,570
happens is you might be applying and

728
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,120
let's say they do have somebody working

729
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:04,480
on drones but that person is going to

730
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,799
retire in a few years and because

731
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,230
they're retiring in a few years they're

732
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,639
not taking students again you know

733
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,160
you're not likely to get accepted

734
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,210
because they can't suit you know there's

735
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,500
going to be nobody there to work with

736
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,840
you

737
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,700
you know let's say there's a couple of

738
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,500
people working at that program but both

739
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,120
of them just took five students last

740
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,740
year and they can't possibly take

741
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,149
another student you know they're not

742
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,920
going to be able to admit you right

743
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,960
because they want you to work with those

744
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,009
people if those people can't take

745
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,259
students you're not going to get

746
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:33,099
accepted right so this fit question

747
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,660
they're going to look at your

748
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:37,179
application and try to figure out you

749
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,370
know who with this university would the

750
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,980
student be best suited to work with and

751
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:44,229
if they can't find anybody who's well

752
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,150
suited to advise you then they're not

753
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,710
going to admit you right even if you're

754
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,360
a great student even if you have funding

755
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,539
you know they need to have that fit

756
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:55,569
piece and sometimes it's hard for you as

757
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:57,789
an applicant to predict that but you can

758
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:59,950
help yourself by doing your research

759
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,690
right if you're applying to a place that

760
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,519
there's only one person doing that

761
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,230
research or no people doing that

762
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,059
research you probably might want to be

763
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,740
careful about that whereas if there's

764
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,569
like five or six people all doing the

765
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,150
same thing your odds of making a match

766
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:15,250
are much better right if there's only

767
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,840
one person by all means reach out to

768
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,910
that person say hey you know I think

769
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,789
your research is great I want to make an

770
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,490
application you know are you taking

771
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,529
students at the moment

772
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,450
do you have funding for new students at

773
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:29,309
the moment and if they say wow this is

774
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,500
great I would love to have a student but

775
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:33,659
I haven't had a grant in 20 years and I

776
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,730
have no idea how I would fund you that's

777
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,500
a red flag right you know you might

778
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,210
think let's not make an application

779
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,769
there so you can sort of weight things

780
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,140
in your favor by doing your legwork

781
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:45,150
right you can look at that who's there

782
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,280
how many people are there you can reach

783
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,900
out to them you don't have to like ask

784
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,690
them to make a commitment all you have

785
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,759
to say is are you do you think you'll be

786
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,200
likely to take students next year you

787
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,079
know do you have funding for a new

788
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,519
student at this time and it's possible

789
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,379
faculty are busy they might not get back

790
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,849
to you but it's an easy question and so

791
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
most often they'll say yeah you know

792
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,059
there's a good chance I might be taking

793
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,350
someone and then you sort of put that in

794
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,710
your notes and you say okay that's a

795
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:13,919
good school to apply to

796
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,110
so so the funding the fit and then and

797
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,390
then the merit so the merit I mean the

798
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:22,369
the pieces of the application that

799
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:25,890
relate to merit or your coursework right

800
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:27,359
GPA is an important thing in getting

801
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,000
into grad school but probably not as

802
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,549
important as getting into undergrad I

803
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
would say there's a wide range of GPAs

804
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,019
that we accept into graduate school and

805
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,109
partially we're not as concerned about

806
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,730
GPA just because you don't spend as much

807
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:42,809
time in the classroom you know what we

808
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,450
want to know is are you going to be

809
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,970
successful in research you know the book

810
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,500
learning isn't as important anymore we

811
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,720
are very interested in what courses

812
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,180
you've taken so if you've taken really

813
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,009
easy classes if you've sort of not taken

814
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,529
important classes that we think are

815
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,180
crucial to getting into grad school in

816
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:02,160
our area that's going to be more of a

817
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,370
problem than if your GPA was a little

818
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,870
bit lower than a 4.0 right

819
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,699
and you guys are all going in the right

820
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:10,889
direction because you're plant sciences

821
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,630
majors you know got good core

822
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,009
requirements you know you're doing the

823
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,840
background that you would need to get

824
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:17,400
into a lot of different programs in the

825
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,709
sciences so that's probably not going to

826
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,720
be an issue for you

827
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:24,840
so there's coursework you know we do

828
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,940
look at GRE scores right but Giri scores

829
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,909
again we don't expect perfect GRE scores

830
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,880
you know most of the students we admit

831
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:35,279
tend to be in the top quartile

832
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,160
but but people below and you're not in

833
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,470
the top quartile can we'll get accepted

834
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,300
it's sort of a balancing game you know

835
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,920
if you have a really high GPA but your

836
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,059
GRE is a little lower you know that's

837
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,009
probably gonna be okay

838
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,389
so those are two components we look at

839
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:51,640
but neither one of them are sort of

840
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:54,500
determinative in its own right and then

841
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,900
the letters of recommendation are really

842
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,150
important right and so this is why again

843
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,830
you want to have real-world experiences

844
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,009
because if you take a course with

845
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:06,159
somebody and they you know they you're

846
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:08,269
one of 200 people and

847
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,890
you know they can say oh they did really

848
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:11,240
well on the final that's not a really

849
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,190
good letter of recommendation right

850
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,509
whereas if you do an internship or a

851
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,640
research experience where you're working

852
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,619
with that person closely over a whole

853
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,570
semester or maybe multiple semesters

854
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,969
that person's gonna be able to write a

855
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:25,069
much better letter that recommends you

856
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,259
for who you are for your capabilities

857
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:30,819
and your strengths and your interests

858
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:33,470
and so getting to know you know

859
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:35,240
professionals is a good way to be able

860
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,490
to get good letters of recommendation

861
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,299
and then the last part of your

862
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:44,660
application itself is your

863
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,549
your statement of purpose and so you

864
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,430
have to write a statement when you get

865
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:50,809
into undergrad -

866
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,090
but that's a little bit more of kind of

867
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:56,240
like an essay I think the statement of

868
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:58,539
purpose for grad school you know I like

869
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,130
to describe it as more like

870
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:04,039
you know it's more you telling your

871
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,170
story it's you talking about where

872
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,329
you're coming from and where you're

873
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,970
going and filling in the gaps in between

874
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:12,470
so what I like to say with a statement

875
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,360
of purpose and going to grad school is

876
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,519
you're trying to convince the admissions

877
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,949
committee that you're really interested

878
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,769
and passionate in this area that you're

879
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,900
trying to get a degree in and that

880
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:25,759
you're well prepared to be successful in

881
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,160
that endeavor so usually you want to

882
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,650
start off with where you're coming from

883
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,850
so how did you learn about this topic so

884
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,040
you guys are all interested in plant

885
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:36,079
sciences so you might say oh I got

886
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,029
interested in plant sciences because I

887
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,309
had this really remarkable experience

888
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:42,559
once that involved a plant right and so

889
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:45,579
whatever that is anybody why are you

890
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,579
guys in plant sciences

891
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,400
did anybody have a formative experience

892
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:52,450
or it's like this is the only thing the

893
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,450
cows would accept you for

894
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:59,889
yeah why'd you guys pick plant sciences

895
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:02,889
death by the pool

896
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,890
yeah

897
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,730
that would be a superb way to start that

898
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,730
kind of statement yeah somebody else

899
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,730
yeah

900
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:24,570
yeah why can't you be a florist oh

901
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:28,070
okay okay and they wanted more and

902
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,069
better things okay good

903
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,460
awesome time pathology there you are

904
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,460
yeah

905
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:49,589
sure and these are all great right so

906
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,779
this is how you sort of start talking

907
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:53,639
about it you know it's your interaction

908
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,349
with professionals right your real-world

909
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,420
experiences you know these are the

910
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:59,549
things that ground you and you say hey

911
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,170
this is how I got excited and then the

912
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:04,259
next step is what did you do with that

913
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,610
information so okay I applied to one of

914
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,619
the best schools in the world to study

915
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:09,418
plant sciences you know I went there and

916
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:11,398
I worked with professionals and I did

917
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,440
these research experiences and I

918
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,759
understood that you know this is really

919
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,789
what I want to do I want to learn about

920
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,770
plant pathogens or I want to learn about

921
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:21,119
agronomy and I took coursework and I did

922
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:23,009
this internship and then I did this

923
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,509
other internship right and so you're

924
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,399
sort of telling your story and then you

925
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:31,020
say and what I've really realized is I

926
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:33,089
want to do X you know you then sort of

927
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,668
project forward you say in 10 years 15

928
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:38,579
years I want to win the World Food Prize

929
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,949
by you know increasing productivity of

930
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:42,389
something or other right so you project

931
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:45,509
forward what you want to be and you say

932
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,570
to get there what I really need is a PhD

933
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,889
in plant sciences from your school all

934
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,269
right so you're telling that story so

935
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,370
where did you start what's your interest

936
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:56,009
how did that interest grow how did you

937
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:58,589
develop your skill set where do you want

938
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,450
to get and why is the degree at this

939
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,210
program that you're targeting the

940
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:05,659
natural inevitable next step for you on

941
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,260
your trajectory to a Nobel Prize

942
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:09,989
unfortunately we don't have a lot of

943
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,230
Nobel Prizes and the plant sciences you

944
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:15,539
can get them you can get them a little

945
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,039
harder yeah so that statement of purpose

946
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,900
is important and it's also important in

947
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,110
terms of telling your own story if

948
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,329
there's something in your application

949
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,860
package that you're worried about or

950
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,989
something that you want to emphasize

951
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,380
this is your chance right if you're

952
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:31,909
really proud of thing you did you want

953
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,440
to fit that in there if there's

954
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:35,328
something that was really important you

955
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,039
want to fit that in if there's something

956
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:39,980
you're really nervous about I mean it's

957
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,750
quite common that you know maybe you had

958
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,000
a real hard time in that organic

959
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,929
chemistry class or maybe you know you

960
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,679
got a D in calculus that would be me

961
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:53,750
sorry but maybe maybe you did badly on

962
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,549
the GRE test right you don't want to

963
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,500
ignore that because somebody's gonna see

964
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,589
it right but you can tell your own story

965
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,599
you can say you know I got a D because

966
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:04,429
you know it was really a big adjustment

967
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,230
you know going to college and my

968
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:09,108
girlfriend dumped me and my grandma died

969
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,429
and all this bad stuff happened but you

970
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:12,049
know the next semester I turned it

971
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:14,449
around and got straight A's you know so

972
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,519
I owned that and I made sure I doubled

973
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:17,808
down and I improved so then you take

974
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:19,489
this thing that looks like a weakness

975
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,470
and you turn it into a strength in a

976
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:23,088
story of personal development right and

977
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:24,949
so the statement of purpose lets you do

978
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:26,239
that so I think frankly that's the first

979
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,088
thing I look at when I look at an

980
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,709
application because if somebody is

981
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:32,058
passionate and committed about what

982
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,699
they're doing and they know who they are

983
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:36,650
that's usually pretty obvious as soon as

984
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,239
I read that and if they're just adrift

985
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,500
and they don't know what they want to do

986
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,269
and they're going to grad school because

987
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,099
they don't know what else to do that's

988
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:44,210
obvious too so that statement is

989
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:46,730
something I think that's really

990
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,380
important but those other components are

991
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,219
the you know statement the GRE is the

992
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,690
coursework and very much

993
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:55,308
well I guess your letters of

994
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,780
recommendation and then that real world

995
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:58,250
experience piece so we're going to look

996
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,369
for that but that'll also help you to

997
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,289
write that letter

998
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:05,119
good

999
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:08,088
other questions about grad school or

1000
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,210
applications I'm so you brought up what

1001
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:12,389
I'm grad school they're like this word

1002
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,340
whatever color

1003
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:17,549
hmm so it's that that can vary I mean it

1004
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,160
you you really

1005
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,539
you have to look and read the

1006
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,379
description of what the fellowship is

1007
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:27,849
all about number one and think about it

1008
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,769
and then I would take that fellowship

1009
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:31,569
application to some professional you

1010
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,909
work with or an advisor and get their

1011
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,590
opinion on it and then all of those

1012
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:38,259
programs are going to have some kind of

1013
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,019
coordinator or project manager or

1014
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,300
program officer and I would very much

1015
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:45,130
touch base with that person you know it

1016
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,810
might be that those guidelines are

1017
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,970
really straightforward and you feel

1018
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,009
comfortable if you have any question or

1019
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,379
even if you think it might be helpful

1020
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,970
you know it's okay to contact the person

1021
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,590
in charge of that program and say hey

1022
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:58,389
this is who I am this is what I'm

1023
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,980
interested in you know can you give me

1024
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:02,440
advice in what you're looking for you

1025
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,840
know is this suitable and that can be

1026
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,329
very helpful right rarely ever would

1027
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,130
that be detrimental

1028
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:11,289
so that can help to get information so

1029
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,019
each program has different you know some

1030
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,389
of them are designed for you know maybe

1031
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:18,039
they're designed for trying to enhance

1032
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:20,799
the number of people doing international

1033
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,710
research or you know people with a

1034
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,840
certain background

1035
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:28,360
you know NSF tends to have different

1036
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,550
focus areas like biology or chemistry or

1037
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,920
engineering so you'd want to sort of

1038
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,990
suss that out

1039
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,420
yeah yeah yeah I mean the other thing

1040
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:39,099
you could do I don't know we must have

1041
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,210
these resources at Cornell certainly for

1042
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:45,279
NSF but you can find out sort of who who

1043
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,139
has gotten these awards in the past and

1044
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,200
you should be able to sort of figure out

1045
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:51,670
sort of you know you know get some sense

1046
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,699
as to how those people have been

1047
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,559
successful I

1048
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,939
know we have a few programs that are

1049
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,799
aimed to trying to help students get

1050
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,690
those NSF fellowships but they're sort

1051
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,950
of all over campus so I'm not sure that

1052
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,950
I could point you towards one

1053
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:17,708
where should I start

1054
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,619
so you can take it as many times as you

1055
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:29,000
want hi

1056
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,859
the only score that you really see in

1057
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,559
the application is the highest score so

1058
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,910
they don't show you

1059
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,860
like every time you've taken the test

1060
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,319
usually they show you the highest score

1061
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,550
so if you get a low score and you want

1062
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,740
to take it again there's really no

1063
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,269
penalty because if you do worse it's not

1064
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:47,000
going to show up if you do better it

1065
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:49,159
will and the bad one will go away I mean

1066
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,820
it costs money and time and effort to do

1067
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:55,190
that so you don't just take it 20 times

1068
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:58,700
but no I mean you can take it when you

1069
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:01,010
feel like you're ready it's not it's not

1070
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:03,019
really it's not a real heavy content

1071
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,300
based exam you know so it's kind of like

1072
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:08,030
the SAT in that regard where it doesn't

1073
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,460
require a lot of coursework you know you

1074
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,870
don't have to have like knowledge and

1075
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,690
the plant sciences to do well on that

1076
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,309
test it is unfortunately one of these

1077
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,619
things where test prep makes a

1078
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:20,809
difference so you know getting a book

1079
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:22,579
and reading about questions practice

1080
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:25,519
questions if you want to take a course

1081
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,349
on how to do it those those things do

1082
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,849
help

1083
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:33,049
but but yeah early and often potentially

1084
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:35,829
you know there's there's no downside I

1085
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,830
think to doing that

1086
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:43,710
they in the past they have had some

1087
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,899
Subject Tests you know we never get

1088
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,480
those scores and so I we don't require

1089
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,099
them it used to be that some

1090
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,010
universities did I don't even know if

1091
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:55,799
they still offer those but they have in

1092
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,900
the past had some so so if so generally

1093
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,090
they're not required if your program

1094
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,550
requires it you'll actually see you know

1095
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,440
and that's a good reason to look out you

1096
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,210
know for what programs you're interested

1097
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,250
in because there might be a particular

1098
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,139
program you want that requires a

1099
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,719
particular subject test but in general

1100
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:14,190
no they're not no not a lot of programs

1101
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,629
I'm familiar with and particularly in

1102
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,670
the plant sciences I'm not aware of

1103
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:21,200
anybody who would require a subject test

1104
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,200
just the general GRE

1105
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:31,289
I've covered most of the things I want

1106
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,769
to talk about so do you guys I mean do

1107
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:37,049
you have other questions so so

1108
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:38,458
what grad school is all about I guess I

1109
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:40,199
didn't talk a whole lot about what you

1110
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:42,208
can do with a grad degree that's

1111
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,599
something we should talk about but

1112
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:47,719
preparing for graduate school or getting

1113
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,099
admitted

1114
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:52,130
anybody anybody have any suggestions

1115
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:54,630
what can you actually do with a PhD

1116
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,729
besides be a professor because you can

1117
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,869
be a professor you have to get a PhD if

1118
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:59,998
you want to be a professor what else do

1119
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:01,369
you do with a PhD what are people with

1120
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:04,918
PhDs do

1121
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:07,939
anybody know anybody know anybody who's

1122
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:11,478
not a professor at Cornell who has a PhD

1123
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:11,478
yeah what does he do

1124
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:19,640
mud mud floods

1125
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:19,639
MD PhD oh

1126
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:25,798
so so are they a sort of academic like

1127
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,219
professors or are they actually doing

1128
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:31,469
just research not just research okay

1129
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:34,708
good you know it's actually it's sort of

1130
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:37,048
ironic but if you get a PhD you can look

1131
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:39,629
at the salaries of PhDs and then you can

1132
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:41,880
look at the salaries of I'm sorry MDS

1133
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,588
and PhDs PhDs always get less than md's

1134
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,568
which we're not disgruntled about that

1135
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:48,538
at all but if you get an MD and a PhD

1136
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:50,849
you actually get less money than if you

1137
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,449
had just an MD it gives you a sense of

1138
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:56,130
how the MDS think about the phd's right

1139
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:58,039
if you get the PhD they're like ah come

1140
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,659
on what's wrong with you

1141
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,278
anybody else anybody knows somebody with

1142
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:05,419
a graduate degree and what they do for a

1143
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:05,418
living yeah

1144
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,190
Oh

1145
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,018
super cool so that's you know very much

1146
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:15,639
you know sort of a business kind of

1147
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:19,419
environment so it like aerospace stuff

1148
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,798
yeah that's super cool so my my I was

1149
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,159
the first person in my family to go to

1150
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,969
grad school but mine one of my cousins

1151
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,848
you know she actually went to the

1152
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:29,919
military and then she got a master's in

1153
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,740
physics so she's working in a hospital

1154
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,048
now working on these giant machines that

1155
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,548
image your body you know sort of look

1156
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:39,099
basically repairing them and make sure

1157
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:41,889
whom they work properly which is kind of

1158
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:44,559
cool it's not aerospace yeah so so

1159
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:46,058
academia is pretty common I think boy

1160
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,369
you know I think I had some statistics

1161
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:53,440
on this yeah so like 30 to 50% of your

1162
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:55,660
PhDs are going to be academic you know

1163
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,269
professors or instructors of some sort

1164
00:43:55,659 --> 00:44:01,239
about twenty to thirty percent or in the

1165
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:03,088
private sector so like Boeing one of my

1166
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:06,098
PhD students is

1167
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:09,179
working at Bayer crop sciences he's

1168
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:11,859
working in their sort of

1169
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,868
genomic research area so he's doing

1170
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,489
genome analyses of plants and microbes

1171
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:18,130
to try and find things that are valuable

1172
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:20,048
for the company you know I've got other

1173
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,210
people who came through my program who

1174
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:24,429
are working at biotech startups in

1175
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,380
agriculture or biotechnology kind of

1176
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:28,598
industries so a lot of people get

1177
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,500
research either research administration

1178
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:35,048
or sales or technical or data positions

1179
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,579
or even writing a lot of PhDs you know

1180
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,920
you get a lot of writing skill doing a

1181
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:40,930
PhD and those scientific writing skills

1182
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,400
are quite marketable so about 20 to 30

1183
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:45,219
percent of PhDs are in the private

1184
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,960
sector maybe about five to ten percent

1185
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:48,578
in government so we have a lot of

1186
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,309
scientists and particularly plant

1187
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:58,048
sciences and EPA USDA NRCS

1188
00:44:53,309 --> 00:45:00,369
the National Science Foundation USGS

1189
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:02,500
even the Department of Energy right so

1190
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:04,869
so these these government agencies

1191
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,989
employ a lot of scientists right and so

1192
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,769
that's opportunities nongovernmental

1193
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:12,058
organizations as well there are

1194
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:15,608
international research organizations or

1195
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:18,420
sort of conservation organizations that

1196
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:21,329
you get a job with with a PhD so there's

1197
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,409
lots out there in fact probably the

1198
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:27,059
majority of jobs are outside of academia

1199
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:29,579
but they're all related to research and

1200
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:32,820
and sometimes they may not even you know

1201
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,860
you get a PhD in the plant sciences you

1202
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,119
know the skill set you have of course

1203
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,099
it's a natural for you to get a job

1204
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,619
relating to plant sciences or

1205
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,809
agricultural biotechnology but that

1206
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:44,789
skillset translates in a lot of ways so

1207
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:46,230
you know there are jobs and like you

1208
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,789
could get jobs probably in the Patent

1209
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,219
Office right if you've got this

1210
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:51,989
knowledge you know they need people with

1211
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:53,459
knowledge because you're patenting stuff

1212
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:55,618
that relates to plant science all the

1213
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,449
time and so somebody with a PhD and the

1214
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,850
plant sciences would be marketable there

1215
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:02,489
you also have that skill set in terms of

1216
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:04,019
research maybe that data analytics

1217
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:06,000
there's a lot of big data and plant

1218
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,880
sciences and if you know how to work

1219
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,829
with big data a lot of the ways you work

1220
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,800
with data whether it's DNA sequence data

1221
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:15,900
or census data or some corporate kind of

1222
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,390
data you know those computer skills are

1223
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,150
going to translate pretty well so so

1224
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:22,618
even if you're going into the graduate

1225
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,630
degree in the plant sciences of course

1226
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,460
you probably like plant sciences you

1227
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,930
know but that degree is still somewhat

1228
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,240
flexible you know you're not you're not

1229
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:32,099
necessarily pigeon-holed and there are a

1230
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:36,049
lot of and that's why the unemployment

1231
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:36,049
rate for PhDs is so darn low

1232
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,599
good

1233
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,599
yeah

1234
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,700
that's a great question

1235
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:53,890
that's a great question and I would say

1236
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:56,750
yes and no so I think where you go

1237
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:58,690
where you go is probably somewhat less

1238
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,909
important than who you work with

1239
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,250
and so the reason for that is because

1240
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:06,799
your training is going to be very

1241
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,599
strongly influenced by the program of

1242
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,480
the of the person you're working with

1243
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,099
your mentor they have a professional

1244
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,630
network they're known for a certain

1245
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,889
thing they're good at a certain thing

1246
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:20,539
and they're gonna be training you in

1247
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:22,849
that area so if the world expert in and

1248
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:25,539
using drones to measure agronomic

1249
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:29,509
variables is at

1250
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:31,309
you know Humboldt State in California

1251
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:33,590
not to like to mean Humboldt State but

1252
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:35,599
but say you're at Humboldt State you're

1253
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:37,130
probably better off going to Humboldt

1254
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,199
State if that's your area of interest

1255
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,970
rather than like going to like a Harvard

1256
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,799
Stanford if there's nobody doing that

1257
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:44,719
thing at Harvard or Stanford I mean yeah

1258
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,090
you'd have this fancy degree you know

1259
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,529
but if you're interested is being a

1260
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,470
leader in that area you want to get

1261
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,580
trained from the leader in that area and

1262
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:55,219
professionals know that you know like so

1263
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:57,110
I'm a microbiologist I know you know

1264
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:59,000
there aren't so many microbiologist out

1265
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,460
there that I don't know the people in my

1266
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,199
field I know them and so I know if you

1267
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,000
came from a particular area I know

1268
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,619
something about you you're gonna have

1269
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,960
certain skills I'm gonna have certain

1270
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:10,839
expectations and that's based on the

1271
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,220
person not the place

1272
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,289
it might differ a little bit if you're

1273
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:17,269
interested in industry you know if

1274
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:19,400
you're working in an area outside of

1275
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,960
your focus so if you're in the plant

1276
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,760
sciences and you're staying in the plant

1277
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,099
science is who you work with is probably

1278
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,780
more important than where you go but the

1279
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:28,789
further you get away from that core

1280
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,010
discipline so if you're getting a job in

1281
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:33,380
a biotech industry where they don't know

1282
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,150
anything about Plant Sciences or you

1283
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,740
want to get a writing job you know they

1284
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,840
might be more impressed by the place

1285
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:41,689
rather than the person right so I won't

1286
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,490
say that the place doesn't matter but it

1287
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,409
matters more the further you get away

1288
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:47,539
from the focus and the more you're

1289
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:48,980
maintaining that focus probably the less

1290
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:51,690
the place matters and more the person

1291
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,150
matters good

1292
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:56,190
and that's again where as a student you

1293
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,568
don't always know who the best people to

1294
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,190
work with are but that's why you want to

1295
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:01,048
develop a network while you're here at

1296
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,760
Cornell because the people who you're

1297
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:03,989
going to be working with your advisors

1298
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,789
and the graduate students and the

1299
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:07,858
postdocs they'll have a sense and

1300
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:09,150
they'll be able to tell you oh if you're

1301
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:10,469
interested in this you probably want to

1302
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,910
work with one of these three or four

1303
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,909
people yeah

1304
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:21,680
oh

1305
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:21,680
that's great

1306
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:30,469
yeah starting your own companies that's

1307
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:34,059
another thing yeah yeah

1308
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:36,419
and you want to make your own job

1309
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:39,539
we were having that

1310
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,980
gives you a level of credibility yeah

1311
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:44,380
because you're able to you know you're

1312
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,329
you've got a director level position you

1313
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,280
can identify a research project and then

1314
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:50,860
lead that project and and whether that's

1315
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,990
in academia or starting a company it's

1316
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,660
the same same skill set I mean in a lot

1317
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:57,429
of senses you know being a faculty

1318
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,049
member is kind of like running a startup

1319
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:01,210
you know cuz all of your funding comes

1320
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,620
externally and that's like capital

1321
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,199
investment right so you're basically

1322
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:06,699
always drumming up capital to do your

1323
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,409
research so there's a lot of

1324
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:10,389
relationship between starting up the

1325
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:12,839
small company and being an academic so

1326
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:14,519
oddly enough and the science is at least

1327
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,710
yeah

1328
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:20,130
yeah other questions again I think I've

1329
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:22,389
covered everything I wanted to cover

1330
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:24,630
there's probably a million questions we

1331
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,629
could answer

1332
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:30,500
yeah

1333
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:31,599
so I like to tell people you know if you

1334
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,679
want to take

1335
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:37,489
it depends on what you do with the time

1336
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:39,980
so so the best case scenario if you're

1337
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:43,250
taking time off is you're doing

1338
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:47,389
something that relates to your area of

1339
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,369
interest so for example and it might

1340
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:51,500
actually be strategically important for

1341
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:52,699
you to do that so the best case is let's

1342
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,489
say you came in as a transfer student

1343
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:57,289
and let's say you didn't have a lot of

1344
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:59,569
opportunities to do research while you

1345
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:01,489
were here at Cornell and you remembered

1346
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,660
you know Dan Buckley at this talk told

1347
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:03,769
me that I should have a lot of research

1348
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,929
experience before I go to grad school

1349
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,250
okay well you know with your

1350
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,440
undergraduate degree you can probably

1351
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:11,300
get a job as a technician either in a

1352
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,920
company or maybe in a research lab

1353
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,930
somewhere on campus maybe here at

1354
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,420
Cornell so then you work for a year or

1355
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:19,549
two doing research in the plant sciences

1356
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,260
something related to it doesn't have to

1357
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,450
be exactly the same but something close

1358
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,800
to what you're interested in so then you

1359
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:26,750
apply for grad school you're actually

1360
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,700
gonna be much stronger you know with

1361
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,230
those two years break then you would

1362
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:32,359
have been right out of undergrad because

1363
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:35,000
now you're coming with this background

1364
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,309
the skill set another good letter of

1365
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,050
recommendation and probably a stronger

1366
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:40,340
statement of purpose because you you

1367
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,650
know better who you are and what you

1368
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,590
want to do so to the degree that that

1369
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:48,530
you take a gap year or years and you're

1370
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:50,600
doing something relevant and that's part

1371
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,220
of your story part of your arc you know

1372
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:54,159
to get you where you want to go then

1373
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:58,039
it's a great idea

1374
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:00,049
if it's totally unrelated then it's not

1375
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,150
as good of an idea right the longer

1376
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,730
you're out of grad school doing

1377
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,410
something that's not relevant to this

1378
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,210
goal you know people are gonna be like

1379
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:10,369
well what were you doing you know if

1380
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,650
you're really interested in going to

1381
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:14,299
grad school for X why did you spend five

1382
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,920
years doing something totally different

1383
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,180
you know I mean and maybe you have a

1384
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,860
good reason for that maybe you can

1385
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,419
justify it but it's going to raise some

1386
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,160
question marks people are gonna be like

1387
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,809
well why did you you know go mountain

1388
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:25,789
climbing in the Andes for five years

1389
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:28,789
what you really want to do is molecular

1390
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:30,259
biology in the lab right so maybe your

1391
00:52:28,789 --> 00:52:32,360
mountain climbing in the Andes because

1392
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,310
you're trying to find a rare plant that

1393
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,030
you want to study you know the molecular

1394
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:38,039
biology of then it make sentence rate

1395
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:41,300
but but you just have to think about how

1396
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:41,300
that fits into your story

1397
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,230
anything else

1398
00:52:55,989 --> 00:53:04,779
this has been a production of Cornell

1399
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:04,780
