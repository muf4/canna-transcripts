1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,638
University but I'm going to start this

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,199
talk out differently than ever

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,679
before uh so who in this room likes

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,079
landscape

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,800
paintings who doesn't like landscape

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,559
paintings I was somebody who didn't love

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,640
landscape

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:31,118
paintings um but I have turned around um

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,640
and you'll see why I'm talking about

11
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:37,200
this in a minute but I mean my work is

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,840
all about biomass but um the Hudson

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,640
River School of Art right was in the mid

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,199
1800s they were American painters uh

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,320
whatever that meant to be an American in

16
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,320
1800 um they were landscape painters and

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,960
they the school was sort of along the

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,480
Hudson River um but they also went out

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,120
west uh some famous names are Thomas

20
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,719
Cole Friedrich Church Albert stat Asher

21
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,118
derland and George

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,798
NF so what do you think of this one

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:13,879
what's what's what's the feeling in this

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:20,118
image EP epic God

25
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:24,039
Grandeur immense huge hunting

26
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,040
wild what's the feeling in this

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,719
one for

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,719
boing Heat

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,759
ominous oid

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,040
oxidation I should do this more

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,040
often um how about this one what's going

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,079
on in this

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,680
one yep agriculture of course you're the

34
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:54,399
first to say that the first time

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,240
impending doom impending doom and

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,799
there's also this little umbrella that's

37
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,798
forming and a little Top Hat down here

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
how about this one what's going on in

39
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,640
this Oney

40
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:11,878
windy battle there's a battle what do

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,159
they wearing those people in Battle Red

42
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,159
Coats there's

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,878
smoke how's this one

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,120
feel peaceful

45
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:31,839
bucolic tick what tick infest tck not

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,840
yet that comes later

47
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:38,280
how about this one how's this one

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,280
feel

49
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,359
what expansive prospecting maybe right

50
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,800
some

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,800
civilization how's this one

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
feel

53
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,280
settled and how does that settling feel

54
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,599
compared to this

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,120
one this is indust industrialization

56
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,359
right it's running on cold the trees are

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,920
cut off there's like it's not just

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,239
bucolic landscape it's like the

59
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,318
beginning of a

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,878
city and then this

61
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,798
one right this is on the

62
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,919
Hudson right the industrial action of

63
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,920
the

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,640
Fisheries so the Hudson River School of

65
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,519
Art reflect on three themes of America

66
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,318
in the 19th century Discovery

67
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,239
exploration and settlement and covers

68
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,280
these ranges of experiences of you know

69
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,840
you come here and this diabolical fear

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,479
of nature this heavenly admiration of

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,438
nature the coexistence with nature the

72
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,878
utility of Nature and the Mastery of

73
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,878
Nature and since my talk is about

74
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,840
biomass I'm fundamentally talking about

75
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,158
the Mastery of nature but I want us all

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,878
to remember that all these other

77
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,000
experiences of New York I showed you in

78
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,158
these images you could think of them as

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,959
just Fantastical paintings but they are

80
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,199
actually documents of other ways of

81
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,039
being on this same landscape right and

82
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:11,359
we are making real choices here

83
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,359
as uh environmental scientists about

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,879
structuring the next generation of what

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,000
our landscape looks like because

86
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,039
certainly New York City where I live

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,399
doesn't look like any of the images I

88
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,680
have just showed you right horizontal

89
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,519
line it's like the first thing I do for

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
the first hour on the bus when I'm

91
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,240
coming here it's all I'm looking for is

92
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,600
the horizontal line and that doesn't

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,439
happen any New

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,479
York

95
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,600
um and the reason why it's happening

96
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:41,839
right

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,400
is we're at such a huge population when

98
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:48,560
I was born in 1973 there were like half

99
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,120
as many people as there are now so we

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,839
have the same land mass but we have

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,360
twice as many people as when I was born

102
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,359
and those paintings I just showed you

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,639
were when we had you know between one

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,639
and two billion people

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,240
and that's the whole earth when you came

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
to the new world when you came to

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,079
America back

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,919
then there were some real ethical

109
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,560
questions about what to do I mean it was

110
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,758
so beautiful but then there were all

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,600
these resources that you could utilize

112
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,319
and so there was a battle between

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,720
becoming wealthy whatever that means and

114
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,240
keeping it

115
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,400
pristine

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,519
okay so here's now the you know the

117
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,000
formal part of the talk but I wanted to

118
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,879
frame it that

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,959
way so how do we manage our landscape

120
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,038
for food feed fiber and Fuel and this

121
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,000
goes back to my early work with John

122
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,159
Duxbury and what I'm continuing to do

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,439
work with

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,720
Peter and specifically I'm going to

125
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,719
focus on the fuel

126
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,879
component

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,400
so uh a couple years

128
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:01,959
ago uh with Peter and many other people

129
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,000
uh we did did a analysis of the New York

130
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:07,879
State biomass feed stock

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,160
production um sustainable feed stock

132
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,240
production uh and it was based on land

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,479
availability land suitability and

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,240
biomass

135
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,639
yield and you know we applied all these

136
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,639
different constraints I'm not going to

137
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,759
go over them I'm sure um you know Forest

138
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,199
will stay as forests protected lands

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,560
meaning state and federal are not used

140
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,960
right existing Wood Products were Main

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,519
mained dead and 35% of tops were left in

142
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,159
the forest for biodiversity right we

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,159
didn't consider equan use not all land

144
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,720
owners are going to want to grow biomass

145
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,039
right so only 50% adopt or roughly you

146
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,840
know herbaceous will remain

147
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,079
herbaceous you know we had all of these

148
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:56,478
factors that we put into this in order

149
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,000
to get this biomass feed stock um number

150
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,000
that could be sustainably produced in

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,800
New York state

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,800
so here's that graph in sum it's 14.2

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,918
terram of biomass for bioenergy per year

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
this is our existing production it's

155
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,000
roughly the same amount and this is what

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we think we could sustainably produce in

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,439
2020

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,279
okay so this is you know if this is what

159
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,598
we're producing in the state already and

160
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:27,318
we're doubling it it seems like a kind

161
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:30,399
of a large Endeavor it's going to change

162
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,360
certain things and practices but

163
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:36,359
to give you some context of what 14.2

164
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,400
teragrams of biomass is this is the New

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,598
York State energy flow chart from nura's

166
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,079
2015 publication but it's based on

167
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,079
2013 New York State

168
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,079
consumes

169
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:56,158
3,665

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,000
uh Terra BTUs so funny I use the T all

171
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,079
the time um and then you have these

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,680
conversion and losses which is basically

173
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,079
only considering the electricity so that

174
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,439
our net consumption is

175
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,639
2,655 all

176
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:16,199
right uh you know this is petroleum is

177
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
purple natural gas coal other fuels

178
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,919
which has nuclear Hydro wind these are

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,400
sort of proportional shapes so you can

180
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:27,918
get a sense of what's going

181
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:30,279
in so this 14.2 teragrams if we just

182
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,838
convert it to a BTU

183
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,519
value right just as raw

184
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,519
biomass accounts for

185
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,120
7% of this

186
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,200
number

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:50,200
okay so all of our sustainable biomass

188
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
7% of our current energy

189
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,639
consumption so what we did was instead

190
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:05,480
of looking at Returns on investments we

191
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,639
looked at how much how we could look at

192
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,240
the processes that this biomass would go

193
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,319
through to do the most work for society

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,079
right you can make gallons of ethanol

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,160
you could make kilowatt hours right

196
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,599
those are products in themselves but

197
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,600
what we want to do since we've got this

198
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,720
finite land base with this finite

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,639
biomass on it we want to do the most

200
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,480
work for society so we this whole

201
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,958
analysis is about uh fundamentally

202
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,120
focused on the work so it's a simple

203
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:40,759
sort of input output analysis we use the

204
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,919
basic unit of the jewel it is a measure

205
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,519
of comparing the quantity of energy and

206
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,199
it misses something of the quality of

207
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,759
energy right not all energies are the

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,839
same when you compare them on a jewel

209
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,000
basis right they might have the same

210
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,519
Jewels but you can do a lot more with

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,919
electric Jewels than you can do with

212
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,560
heat Jewels right so just keep that in

213
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:04,278
mind and then we looked for two types of

214
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,199
Works two types of work um heating for

215
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:09,919
homes or buildings and transport as

216
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,920
measured by distance traveled in a

217
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,159
vehicle so what are the steps in the

218
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,278
boundaries well we have to plant and

219
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,919
grow and harvest the biomass then we

220
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,000
have to move the wet biomass to a

221
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,399
processing plant then we have to convert

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,839
the biomass to a usable form and then we

223
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,078
move that energy product to the

224
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,399
consumer so there are many Energy

225
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,958
Products right that we could get out out

226
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,720
of the cellulosic

227
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,078
biomass um it could be ethanol pellets

228
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,040
grain

229
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:40,638
electricity but then we do one more step

230
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,838
which is we convert that energy to work

231
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:47,039
to think about the end use

232
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,720
efficiency so for growing and harvesting

233
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,360
just to give you an idea I mean this

234
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
list is really long I'm not going to go

235
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,639
through the whole list with you I'm just

236
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,320
showing you three attributes of

237
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,600
comparing you know what happens with

238
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,440
maze versus Willow you know you have to

239
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,360
plow maze a year you you plow for the

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,720
grass one every 10 years and that

241
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,959
affects the energy for the plow and the

242
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,240
boded energy in the

243
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,239
plow so those are some of the attributes

244
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,159
that go into looking at the energy at

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,120
growing and harvesting the

246
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,838
biomass across the different types of

247
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,839
biomass then we have to look at the

248
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,839
moisture content of the biomass cuz that

249
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,519
affects the weight when you're

250
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,760
transporting it to the processing center

251
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,120
we look at the btu content or the gigle

252
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,879
content of that biomass to you know

253
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,399
calculate our raw energy resource these

254
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,519
are the Harvest cost that I just sort of

255
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,000
alluded to in the last slide and then

256
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,720
distances that the biomass is

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,559
transported okay to uh a site so you

258
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,440
know you can see that maze grain was

259
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,919
based on our two ethanol plants so we

260
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,720
only have two ethanol plants in the

261
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,360
state so there's a farther distance that

262
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,079
the corn has to travel whereas um in the

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,919
other scenarios we have

264
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,679
24 smaller biomass plants around the

265
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,000
state so they have a shorter distance to

266
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,399
travel right but I'm just giving you

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,639
some of

268
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,559
the um and this calculates this

269
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,879
translates into how much of the dry

270
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,198
biomass is spent towards Transportation

271
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,439
energy right I'm just there are many

272
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,479
attributes but I'm just trying to give

273
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,399
you a sense of what's going on then you

274
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,399
get to the processing plant um we uh

275
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,600
there are two existing maze grain

276
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,559
ethanol plants but you could also use

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,199
that same maze grain for pellet stove

278
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,278
there's one existing uh combined heat

279
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:45,278
and power plant that uses what wood

280
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,399
chips in lionsdale New York so you losic

281
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,958
ethanol this was in collaboration with

282
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,480
our group for the analysis for

283
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,000
nerta um which is a Next Generation

284
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,959
cellulosic ethanol production and but

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,600
then you could also use that same

286
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,039
cellulose and make pellets which could

287
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,639
go into a pellet stove or you could make

288
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,958
those pellets go into a combined heat

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,600
and power plant to generate electricity

290
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,159
so these are some of the scenarios that

291
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,440
we saw for this

292
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,480
biomass or processing

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,399
scenarios what you need to know about

294
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,879
these scenarios or these processes is

295
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,919
that they have different numbers of

296
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,320
steps right and the more steps you do in

297
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:26,439
a process generally you lose

298
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,320
energy so maze grain is interesting

299
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,480
right because at its 15.55% moisture

300
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,278
content you could just pop it in the

301
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,959
stove you don't have to do anything

302
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,720
before you get heat but all you're

303
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,599
getting out of that product is heat

304
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,160
right you're not getting electricity so

305
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,879
it depends on what you

306
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:44,838
want some others were one step so

307
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,759
biomass was pelletized for pellet stove

308
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,560
the wet wood chips were combusted in a

309
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,919
real plant to generate electricity and

310
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,399
that um plant was 22% efficient in

311
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,198
generate electricity the maze grain is

312
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
converted to ethanol or the cellulose

313
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,078
biomass was converted to ethanol again

314
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,959
one step in the you have a product that

315
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,638
people can use and then we went one step

316
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,278
further and we did two steps where you

317
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,360
take that pelleted uh cellulose and you

318
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:13,519
generated electricity at 30% efficiency

319
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,240
or you put the ethanol in to generate

320
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,440
electricity at a slightly higher uh

321
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,440
conversion

322
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,880
efficiency

323
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,560
oops um so once you have your product

324
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,559
whether it's megawatts it has to go

325
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,638
through the grid and it loses 15 percent

326
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,039
of its energy through the Grid or you

327
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,519
use a truck to take it to the

328
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:41,039
Distribution Center I.E gas station

329
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,039
whatever um that was

330
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,919
calculated and then you have to look at

331
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:47,879
the end use efficiency and this is kind

332
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,639
of where the Crux of our analysis comes

333
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:54,639
down I hope you'll see it later but you

334
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,919
know we put maze in a 75% uh efficient

335
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:03,000
pellet stove the cellulose pellets we

336
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:05,759
put in an 80% efficient stove um the

337
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,320
ethanol and an 80% efficient home boiler

338
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,680
electricity is 99% efficient in

339
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,000
generating heat in a

340
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:17,838
home uh for distance we did ethanol in a

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,278
20% efficient internal combustion engine

342
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,360
and uh we did Distance by you know

343
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,360
electricity and a 75% Efficient Electric

344
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Car

345
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,838
okay in addition there are potential

346
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,639
co-products and I say

347
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,759
potential because there's always

348
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,120
products whether or not they're used and

349
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,399
considered products is another matter

350
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,000
right we call it waste generally because

351
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,799
we have very poor imaginations we use

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,519
waste very frequently so maze ethanol uh

353
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,958
makes dried distillers grains uh that

354
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,480
has a high value for feed animal feed

355
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,758
but remember this analysis keeps

356
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,039
everything on the jewel level we're

357
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,800
comparing everything with jewels so even

358
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,278
though this might have more value in

359
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,039
terms of producing beef or milk or

360
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,039
whatever this is just kept in terms of

361
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,639
jewels as pellets that could go into a

362
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,159
pellet stove okay cellulosic ethanol has

363
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
a small amount of electricity that's

364
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,120
generated as a

365
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,039
co-product um and when you generate

366
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,919
electricity in a power plant you

367
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,480
generate tons of heat um and you could

368
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,759
potentially capture that waste Heat so

369
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,879
the lionsdale biomass plant which runs

370
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,120
on wet wood chips up in Lions Fall New

371
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:41,078
York and it's only 22% efficient it used

372
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,720
to sell its waste heat to a neighboring

373
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,120
paper plant and it would dry the paper

374
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
at the paper

375
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,240
plant something happened and they no

376
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,439
longer do that and the paper plant now

377
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,318
has a natural gas heater to dry their

378
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,959
paper so even though these two companies

379
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:59,919
are close proximity again when energy is

380
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:03,879
cheap you don't have to cooperate right

381
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:07,240
uh you don't and that's a very real

382
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,119
reality um The Maze grain has no

383
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,038
co-product right you're just combusting

384
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:16,359
it straight for heat uh and same thing

385
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:19,038
with the pelletized uh cellulose for

386
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,639
heat um

387
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,400
so the summary table that's coming up is

388
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,120
based on these five characteristics so

389
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm going to try to go through

390
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,000
this I mean just

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,679
this is important is what I guess I'm

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,919
trying to say um so we start out with

393
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,038
this biomass right it's it's got a

394
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,160
volume it's got a character it's it's

395
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,879
got so many BTUs in it uh has a certain

396
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,279
moisture content

397
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,600
whatever and when we want to convert it

398
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,000
uh we're going to go through some

399
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,399
processing losses okay it's just that's

400
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,240
what's going to happen it's going to

401
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,519
lose things in the

402
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,880
process we also had to put things in

403
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,918
right we we had to use energy to apply

404
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,919
nutrients to the field we had we had to

405
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,919
transport it by car right so those are

406
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:13,840
external inputs

407
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,600
okay then we want to do work with that

408
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,158
biomass right we want to heat our homes

409
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,079
and we want to travel

410
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:25,000
distances that's the end goal that's the

411
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:27,558
product but when we do that we lose

412
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,679
energy right you lose it's not an

413
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,798
efficient system turning you know

414
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,320
ethanol into miles driven it's an

415
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,519
inefficient system so there are these

416
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,000
end use

417
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,798
losses and then there are these

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,119
co-products that I just listed that

419
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,798
could be used but if we don't use them

420
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:49,439
then they're wastes right so these five

421
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:53,119
attributes that I'm talking

422
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:59,240
about um oops I guess it's coming

423
00:18:53,119 --> 00:19:02,439
up not next I'll come back to it um

424
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,279
I I want to just talk about the scale at

425
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,519
which we're we're doing this these

426
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,158
analyses because you know scale matters

427
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:13,759
so one scenario is just Greenwood chips

428
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,200
an existing power plant of 20 megawatt

429
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,960
um and it has a simple conversion

430
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,798
efficiency of

431
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,440
22% um maze grain to existing power

432
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:27,400
plants right it's 54% efficient and when

433
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,360
I say simple conversion I mean you're

434
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,240
getting you're getting

435
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,719
all this ethanol out without thinking

436
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,640
about any of the inputs that went into

437
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,120
it okay so it's 54% of the biomass BTU

438
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,919
but not of the total Energy System BTU

439
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,239
right it just means you put in this much

440
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,480
corn you got this much ethanol out but

441
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,679
you also put lots of other things in so

442
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm just giving you these simple

443
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,960
conversion efficiencies to show you the

444
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,918
range at the very first step without

445
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,319
considering any of the other things so

446
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,919
of course mayze grain in a pellet stove

447
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,439
right you're not talking about the

448
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,600
energy that went into making the maze

449
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,759
grain it's 100% efficient because you've

450
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,678
got the corn grain already in the form

451
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,038
that you want or you need to use in your

452
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,038
pellet

453
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,038
stove

454
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,279
um and this is just sort of a

455
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,440
summarizing chart also of inputs and

456
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,158
products

457
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,000
so there's the biomass energy content

458
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,640
this is the energy within the biomass

459
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,880
that we harvested and this is the

460
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,200
supplemental energy that we had to add

461
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,000
to it in order to be able to make the

462
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,919
products okay and then we get these

463
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,279
primary products which is you

464
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,520
know uh electricity ethanol grain

465
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,480
pellets electricity ethanol and

466
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,240
electricity and then these co-products

467
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,240
that I was just talking to you about

468
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,200
before oops so here's the chart and I'm

469
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,558
going to do it in three doesn't have

470
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,279
labels because that comes in the next

471
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,279
one I'm just trying to orient you to

472
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:05,158
this graph

473
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:07,480
so each one of these bars is is a megag

474
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,120
or a unit of

475
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,640
biomass when it's above zero it's work

476
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,839
that is accomplished by by Society for

477
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,038
society like distance traveled or homes

478
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,439
heated when it's below zero it means

479
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,319
that it's been lost somewhere in the

480
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,278
process right it either was lost as an

481
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:29,519
input it was lost in the processing it

482
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:32,000
was lost in the Nu sufficiency

483
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,440
all right and to orient you again these

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
are all about transportation and these

485
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,840
are all primarily about your primary

486
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,720
product being heat okay so next slide

487
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:45,319
adds more

488
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,558
information

489
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:53,158
so this is the processing loss while

490
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:57,240
you're converting um The Maze grain into

491
00:21:53,159 --> 00:22:00,120
ethanol this is the process loss this is

492
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,240
how much product you make

493
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,079
okay whenever it's all this green

494
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,640
whether it's striped or not that's the

495
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,119
amount of product you make so when

496
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,640
you're making

497
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:16,918
ethanol I don't know like

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,960
50% right I said 54% for Maze grain so

499
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,919
this is 54% of the biomass it's turned

500
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,558
into ethanol however you had to use this

501
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,200
much energy input so I'm sort of

502
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,480
deducting that even though you could

503
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,720
sell that ethanol you actually need it

504
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,720
to make the next generation of

505
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,720
ethanol this is when you take that

506
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,798
ethanol and you put it in your car and

507
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,600
you go miles but it's only in a 20%

508
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:48,839
efficient internal combustion engine so

509
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:51,079
that means only 5% of the Corn grain is

510
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,399
going to traveling distance in

511
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,038
miles the rest of it is going off as

512
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,080
waste heat into the atmosphere or maybe

513
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:03,720
heating your car in the winter right

514
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:06,759
now this is the co-product if we don't

515
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,720
use this co-product it should come down

516
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,480
here in most of these scenarios we don't

517
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,240
actually use the co-product but this is

518
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,480
the potential in this case it's dried

519
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,919
distiller grain and it is actually used

520
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,640
for animal feed

521
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:28,600
okay so the point

522
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:31,159
here is that these numbers right here

523
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:34,639
that's the proportion of the biomass

524
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,640
that it's actually doing work for

525
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:42,439
society so if you and then this up here

526
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,359
is the co-product that could do work for

527
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,278
society if we're clever about it if

528
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:55,000
we're not already using it

529
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:58,440
okay so clearly using the maze grain or

530
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,558
the pet pelletized cellulose is going to

531
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:05,400
do the most direct work from the primary

532
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,798
product okay 64 or 69% of that biomass

533
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,320
is going to heat

534
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:15,079
homes you know using 5% of it doing

535
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:19,119
Transportation if it's ethanol cor

536
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:21,359
ethanol all right if we pelletize this

537
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,439
cellulose and we put it in a combined

538
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,599
heat and power plant and we generated

539
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,600
electricity 19% of it could go towards

540
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,398
driving

541
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,918
now if we would just use the waste heat

542
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:37,959
right the whole Collective would be 60%

543
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,399
utility for society now we have two

544
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,640
products we've got heat products and

545
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:45,278
transportation products all right we

546
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,159
like this potentially if we would use

547
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,038
right because electricity is very

548
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:54,240
versatile it's a really powerful fuel

549
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:56,440
type right if we could just be effective

550
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,319
at using the waste heat then this would

551
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,600
be a great percentage that's like 62% of

552
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,720
the biomass is going to products for

553
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,879
society but it requires some

554
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,159
coordination so that that waste heat is

555
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
actually used so even though this is

556
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,320
like the bigger number it's a bigger

557
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
number for heat

558
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:19,319
products right

559
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,000
so the value the quality of the energy

560
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,038
is very

561
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,440
different all

562
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,960
right uh this moved down but this is

563
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,759
supposed to be highlighting this line

564
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,640
but basically the same biomass um can

565
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,158
use 5 to 19% of its photosynthetic

566
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,080
energy to drive miles versus the same

567
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,880
biomass can use 12 to 69% of its

568
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,319
photosynthetic energy to heat homes

569
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,159
right if the objective is to do work for

570
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:50,519
society how do we want to move what

571
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:52,840
kinds of things do we want to support

572
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,839
and move

573
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:02,360
forward so to bring this home and a 25 M

574
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,159
per gallon car I think the average was

575
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,079
23 recently I don't know

576
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:13,240
I uh meant to check on that

577
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:16,678
but at an average of $323 this is

578
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,798
averaged across uh the last three years

579
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:24,278
okay now I recognize when I took my bus

580
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:29,158
it was $157 in New Jersey so you can

581
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:32,278
divide this by two and get your number

582
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,840
but I don't think a157 is forever but

583
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:38,359
anyways gas at 323 a gallon electricity

584
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:42,918
at 18 cents per kilowatt hour ethanol at

585
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:45,599
$3 a gallon and E85 at 294 a

586
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,799
gallon would cost

587
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,038
$12.78 to use gas to go 100

588
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,398
miles versus

589
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:58,519
$67 to go 100 miles in an electric

590
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:01,798
vehicle okay now I just reduce this by

591
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,119
half $157 so right now they're equal in

592
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:10,000
terms of the cost

593
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:12,759
right uh but I you're getting it

594
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,079
right look at it at a different

595
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,759
perspective so if we took all the

596
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,480
cellulose all the sustainable cellulose

597
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,038
from New York

598
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,480
State and we converted into

599
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:26,960
ethanol and we made this many gallons of

600
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,159
ethanol at $3 a gallon it would cost the

601
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,759
consumer 4.2 billion

602
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:35,360
to buy those gallons right if we pallet

603
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,079
all the cellulose for electric cars and

604
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,479
we converted it to electricity at 18

605
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,720
cents per kilowatt hour it's $3.7

606
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:49,399
billion to the consumer kind of the same

607
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:53,720
price but you can only drive 35 * 10 9

608
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:56,479
miles versus 60 * 109 miles on the same

609
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,480
price right is everybody kind of getting

610
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,480
this

611
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,320
so these are my modest

612
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:08,158
conclusions our biomass only accounts

613
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,278
for 7% of primary energy consumption we

614
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,399
could increase efficiency and all kinds

615
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:14,159
of levels but in this particular case I

616
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,359
hope it makes it clear the electric

617
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,399
vehicle versus the internal com com

618
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:19,798
combustion

619
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:22,398
vehicle and then thinking about

620
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:24,798
diversity of end use right we're moving

621
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,518
away from just fuels for transportation

622
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,200
and thinking more cohesively about the

623
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,200
whole system and what we want to deliver

624
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,880
to

625
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,640
society meanwhile we have to think about

626
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,440
seasonal um changes and be sensitive to

627
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,080
climate changes and how this

628
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,440
intensifies the land base and what are

629
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,879
the competing uses for this land base

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,880
right we could all go back to the colic

631
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,519
images of the Hudson River School that

632
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,559
would be a choice or we could get really

633
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,038
inefficient cars and have that right I

634
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,558
mean we have many choices um there are

635
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,599
there's tons of competing land uses

636
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:06,319
um and generally less conversion means

637
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:08,439
greater social benefit um uh but it's

638
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,038
remember it depends

639
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,120
immediately

640
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:16,278
uh and more salable product does not

641
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:19,319
mean more societal work right that's

642
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:21,480
kind of the point and this last one I

643
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,359
apologize I just couldn't help myself

644
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:29,278
but I'll just move

645
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:31,809
on um so that is that um I would love to

646
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:35,480
entertain questions thank

647
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:38,918
[Applause]

648
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,919
you for New

649
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:45,519
York I at this point I really like the

650
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,399
pel

651
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,839
C right

652
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:54,158
um because even though it doesn't get

653
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:57,278
the maximum out of the

654
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,600
umuse in the biomass it gives us two

655
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,440
products

656
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:04,000
and I think uh I think that's two very

657
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,759
important parts heat we live in a

658
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,079
freezing cold Society we need the heat

659
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:13,519
it's a serious necessity right it's as

660
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:16,038
important as food right um but

661
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,319
electricity is incredible it has so much

662
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:23,679
capacity so while the easy answer is to

663
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:28,798
say you know pellet stoves and and P you

664
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,798
know for porn or for pel cellulose

665
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:37,199
I I live in New York City um I grew up

666
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,639
with a wood stove I have no interest in

667
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
necessarily going back to Wood I think

668
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,320
it's a lovely thing but a lot of people

669
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,359
aren't going to accept that but this

670
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,038
electricity is very useful so we just

671
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,319
have to be clever we've got all kinds of

672
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:53,679
industries that could use that waste

673
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:55,720
heat right or we could just uh have

674
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,038
smaller combined heat and Power Systems

675
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,440
all over the place and looking at a

676
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,558
bonson New York City he and I met with

677
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,960
norta a couple of weeks ago to figure

678
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,200
out how you identify locations that have

679
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,120
combined he and Power Systems so that

680
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,639
your electricity is cogenerating your

681
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,518
heat it's very simple and in fact New

682
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,918
York City was based on combined heating

683
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,720
power back in the day but we used coal

684
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,919
which made so much particulate matter

685
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,558
that it was actually powerful to

686
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,880
everybody but we have other fuel choices

687
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,398
and what does it mean when you generate

688
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,720
your electricity and you use your waste

689
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,959
heat you've just reduced your impact by

690
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,240
50% because you lose so much off that

691
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,399
rais teeth right you don't have to lose

692
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,278
another energy source to heat that same

693
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:44,038
are so I I am very much of the mind that

694
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,278
to provide heat and power not just for

695
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:50,200
biomass products but for all of our

696
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:53,278
Energy Products it's a very I don't know

697
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,000
why we

698
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:59,679
can't um yeah with sort of with the way

699
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,359
that this is set up with growing biomass

700
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,000
and

701
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,719
expg it raises questions for me about

702
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,720
nutrient Cy

703
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:14,919
um meaning extracting nutrients from the

704
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,600
fields or the for these are okay so in

705
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,799
our analysis that we did at the very

706
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:25,079
beginning of this presentation and fora

707
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:27,158
we do replacements for those systems

708
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,519
what that means though at the consumer

709
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:33,039
end like happens to the nutrients in the

710
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,278
combined he power plant Ash or in the

711
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:40,679
pelis of Ash that is not Incorporated in

712
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,398
this analysis right so it's not fully

713
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,679
cycling it's just getting nutrients from

714
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,678
another source to maintain the

715
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,240
quity a question about this simple

716
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:56,119
question one from the right has some

717
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:00,558
byproduct or product and yet it's used

718
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:03,719
for PE and sure what that would

719
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:06,798
be okay so you're talking about yeah the

720
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,798
one that says 26

721
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:13,278
on right so all of this all of these

722
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,919
co-products up here could easily be

723
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:19,599
added down here because we're going to

724
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:22,000
use them okay this is a Hy so the green

725
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,879
is what actually is a product that we're

726
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,079
using in society this could be a product

727
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
we're using so like the cellulosic

728
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,158
ethanol

729
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,038
it makes electricity that most

730
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,799
definitely is getting used that's not

731
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,410
the specifically on the heat there are

732
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,480
some like

733
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,660
[Music]

734
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,200
one7

735
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:46,440
[Music]

736
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:50,159
could the is he oh this is waste he

737
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,558
waste heat so in these two scenarios so

738
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,760
the windship plant it used to use the

739
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,038
waste heat to dry paper of a neighboring

740
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:01,798
paper plant and it doesn't and and then

741
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:04,759
this scenario um so this is based off of

742
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:08,079
a combined heat and powered pellet plant

743
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:11,000
that is done in

744
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,519
as Canada I don't know but they don't

745
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,039
use the waste heat but it's an

746
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,960
industrial site and it could it could be

747
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,559
used J I think what might maybe what

748
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,240
you're getting at is what's the

749
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,480
difference between the primary and the

750
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,279
secondary product for that is cu it says

751
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,918
heat up top

752
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:36,760
oh okay confus

753
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:41,158
H so the transportation is it's green

754
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,879
part right here um uh transportation is

755
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,679
a screen part here and then heat is the

756
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:47,799
green part here and then these are

757
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,960
co-products which are variable according

758
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,519
to each system and they may or may not

759
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,800
be used so in this case the drve dis

760
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:58,320
stealer strands are used in this case

761
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,519
electricity is used uh

762
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
in this case it would be waste heat that

763
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,440
is

764
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:08,480
not just just for the one he picked out

765
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,639
just explain what the actual scenario is

766
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,838
right okay what what's the product

767
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:17,279
what's the primary product on the

768
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:20,679
secondary okay so in this scenario okay

769
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,200
wait I see I

770
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:28,679
see okay in this scenario we take peled

771
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,358
cellulose we turn it into electricity

772
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,078
you move it through the grid it comes to

773
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:36,358
your chome and you convert it into heat

774
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:39,960
at 99% efficiency in your home so that's

775
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:41,838
the green part this is for clone Heat at

776
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,159
the power plant where you converted it

777
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,759
there's all this waste heat on that all

778
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,559
right and I'm just trying to point out

779
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,640
right this P cellulose right here for

780
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:57,199
electric ke is the same thing as the p

781
00:35:53,639 --> 00:36:00,799
and cellulose for an electric vehicle so

782
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:04,399
this column and this column are the same

783
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,359
electricity process and product but

784
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,838
different and usess okay so we're using

785
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:16,719
19% here in Jing miles and 26 here for

786
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:20,480
getting deliver to your home

787
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,639
okay I I still think you I mean it seems

788
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,800
like you should

789
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:27,960
probably um also reduce even the height

790
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,960
of the gray bars according to to the

791
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,240
efficiency of whatever system would be

792
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,519
used for the waste products because that

793
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,719
I think that's a little bit misleading

794
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:41,039
because if you I mean if the efficiency

795
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:42,879
for for heat for some heat is only 26% I

796
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,079
mean maybe the efficiency for the waste

797
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,000
product is only 26% that doesn't look as

798
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:52,200
attractive you know understood saying in

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,760
in okay so then I'm opening this up for

800
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:58,358
suggestions on improving this

801
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:04,359
graph because actually I love this graph

802
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:06,199
your s all right um and I did this in a

803
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:08,480
light gr sort of match this grade

804
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:11,078
because for all intens and purposes you

805
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,280
know this should be adding up down here

806
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:17,000
okay CU most of the cases it's not even

807
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,440
being used this is a potential use and

808
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,679
yes there are going to be efficiency

809
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,639
losses but I don't know what those are

810
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,399
but this is the range I get the

811
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,358
criticism I'm totally on board with it

812
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,599
um

813
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,598
that's why the green is

814
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:39,039
darker yeah so it might be possible to

815
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,879
add another bar in the upper gray if

816
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,159
there are cases where this

817
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,400
is you can identify this is

818
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,318
freeable you know this is actually sort

819
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,160
of this is being done now kind of cost

820
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:56,000
effectively that might be one way to

821
00:37:52,159 --> 00:38:00,000
say there's some evidence of some small

822
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
wheel function with a

823
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:08,400
laral what is the major limitation as to

824
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:10,599
why that secondary is not why why are we

825
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,599
calling

826
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,400
it uh

827
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,358
well I'm just going to go back to the

828
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,760
one scenario that I know which is so why

829
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,799
so why did that power plant not why

830
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,200
can't they use it for papers you know I

831
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,318
there was a time when I was really very

832
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,318
long those guys was really fun and

833
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,200
um uh and they just they just wouldn't

834
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,160
they wouldn't doubled and so I don't

835
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:48,239
know but I think that they really must

836
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:51,559
something disre because the paper plant

837
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,039
was using the r heat to dry their paper

838
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,920
I mean can you imagine of course when

839
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,679
you make paper it's going to use lots of

840
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,920
heat in order to get all that moisture

841
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,559
off to make papor what a brilliant thing

842
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,400
plus all your waste wood product you go

843
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,920
straight into the biomass net to

844
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,838
generate more electricity I mean it's

845
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,838
it's an industrial

846
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,880
area

847
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,559
gasal

848
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:19,399
gas yeah I don't I don't know but still

849
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,199
there should be some negotiation about

850
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,000
the price of that was te give so it

851
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,480
seems like there needs to some better

852
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,239
understanding what's going on there why

853
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,880
that they're not going if it comes down

854
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:35,039
to Greed they're not going to be putting

855
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,559
in gas furnaces to drive their paper if

856
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,639
they can use this at a che okay but the

857
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,960
other scenario I can tell you is for New

858
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:45,358
York City which used to all be CHP

859
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,800
com but we're running on full and we

860
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,679
moved it out because of a particular so

861
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,839
there's a reason why it's not being used

862
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,399
right that's the reason why it's all

863
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:59,318
being made at remote power plants where

864
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,318
who cares about

865
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:11,400
this is exactly my point these are the

866
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:15,400
problems in doing now meanwhile so the

867
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,240
14th Street in New York City right the

868
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,720
one that went out when we had sanding

869
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,399
and the whole lower half of Manhattan

870
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,078
had no electricity right well that 14th

871
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,720
Street power plant all the way up to

872
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,039
60th Street all the way down to

873
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,799
Chinatown all the we heat the steam

874
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,039
Heats all those

875
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,599
buildings

876
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:39,679
okay it runs on natural gas so it

877
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,880
doesn't have a particular matter b

878
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,759
and you know it also happens to be very

879
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,039
close

880
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,240
to which is why was a problem you just

881
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:53,039
made the case of why it is being used I

882
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,078
would like to understand why it's not

883
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,759
what other efficiencies so that was in

884
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,800
the context of historically in the St

885
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,359
in New York City you had all kinds of

886
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,640
combined power plants but they were cold

887
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,719
and the was making too much smoke in the

888
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,318
city with the high density population so

889
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,000
it

890
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:16,800
out right that is a reason why they from

891
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,599
those old cold PL and longer in the city

892
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,960
we could put in others that are not how

893
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,960
about

894
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,000
smaller Corel Corell comp find heat and

895
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,559
power PL right I mean there's all kinds

896
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,159
of locations there's there's an there's

897
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,318
a ex military building in New York City

898
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,920
which is provide heat power because it

899
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,880
was built in the'

900
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,519
40s and it's 3,000 units and they're off

901
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,519
the great they don't have

902
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,359
oh absolutely but you could also think

903
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,279
that it's a good strategy instead of

904
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,880
having 60 power plants you've got 200

905
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,760
power plants they're smaller and they're

906
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,640
all over the place they're getting much

907
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,720
better overall efficiency you're

908
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,679
collectively burning less fossil fuels

909
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,279
cuz probably for the most part it's

910
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,039
going to be fossil fuel so if you're

911
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,680
using if the waste heat typically is

912
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,358
like 50% of the biomass or the energy

913
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,558
product that goes in is waste heat

914
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:30,119
you've just reduced your energy Bud

915
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,839
budget by a half because you're no

916
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,358
longer reduplicating the heat lost from

917
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:37,480
the Electric Plant and the heat used to

918
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,078
hit your Ro so are you saying that

919
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,000
theoretically part of this problem is

920
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,039
because we're power plant that P yes

921
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,400
okay so this is really a locational

922
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,199
problem PL located where they actually

923
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,750
could use that

924
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,960
generation it's also

925
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,400
[Music]

926
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,400
econom they think

927
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:03,719
so you know I

928
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:12,000
mean that wood chips why don't we use

929
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:15,119
the to drrive

930
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
chips I think the volume which the chips

931
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,000
go in come out I mean I think they run

932
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
out of chips I think that plant has lot

933
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:28,159
of I

934
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,719
gu operation

935
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,159
years

936
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:35,679
ago you always had

937
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,719
excess the problem was what you do with

938
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,879
this

939
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:44,838
heat problem do

940
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,838
electricity but that means that society

941
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:47,838
and

942
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:56,169
[Music]

943
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:07,558
to me what this indicates right is that

944
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,558
this much F or some

945
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,639
fraction if you want to address clate

946
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,440
change right this is a really fast

947
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,879
effective way of doing it I will tell

948
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,720
you for New Year this year I was walking

949
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,079
in my heart and I picked a ro I know I'm

950
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,799
that's in my part but it was an

951
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,880
extraordinary situation so I afforded

952
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,640
myself freedom of picking the rose in my

953
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
Park on New Year's Day because until

954
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:36,879
that

955
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,720
moment I had never conceived of being

956
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,680
able to pick a rose on my birthday now

957
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:44,118
my birthday is on on New Year's my

958
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,838
birthday is on the 10th and so for the

959
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,160
first time my entire life I maybe I'll

960
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:51,279
be able to pick a in my birthday didn't

961
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,558
happen we had a huge free spell and all

962
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,040
the verses but the point here is that

963
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,319
we're living in a conceptually different

964
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,599
moment like it was absolutely

965
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,880
inconceivable for me to think the on

966
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,119
myth or on on my birthday it is no

967
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,920
longer an inconceivability because the

968
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,599
system is rapidly changing so if we want

969
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,800
to address climate

970
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,800
change I would argue that looking at the

971
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,200
waste heat from our electricity system

972
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,960
and I don't mean it necessarily has to

973
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,799
be from biomass right clearly I hope you

974
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,639
recognize that all of this biomass right

975
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,680
we could have bucolic Landscapes instead

976
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,679
of 7% of our energy don't you think you

977
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:29,799
could out 7% of your energy to have

978
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,039
callic

979
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,119
Landscapes right I I I you know these

980
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,239
are real choices that we can actually

981
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,440
make and we're not making those kinds of

982
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,318
choices speaking of choices how do you

983
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,159
put a price or a cost on the ethical

984
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,159
issues of burning

985
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:59,279
corn so let's burn our food so we can

986
00:45:55,639 --> 00:46:02,440
have M I have no problem with burning

987
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,800
formn because you walk out there today

988
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,599
and if I had to choose like I have

989
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,960
enough calories on my body right now to

990
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,519
make it through the next couple of days

991
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,720
but if I had to be out there with no

992
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:15,199
heat I would really like to burn that so

993
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,078
like I don't have that issue but I think

994
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,199
the issue is is that corn is so energy

995
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,599
intensive to produce that you could

996
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,519
produce all other kinds of things

997
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:25,039
alternatively so I don't really think

998
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:27,800
there's a food and fuel

999
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,759
argument right there's like you could

1000
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,160
have corn or you could have corn ethanol

1001
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,559
to run in a Hummer you could have an

1002
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,558
emaciated dog and he could Chase his

1003
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,239
tail seriously that's what we're talking

1004
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:49,400
about so can I just add to

1005
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:52,759
your maybe or maybe I'll subract

1006
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:56,119
kind I mean on a sort of a literal sense

1007
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,680
so the calculation of the this large

1008
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,480
potential

1009
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,519
biomass that's in addition to the food

1010
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,400
feed and fiber we're producing in the

1011
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,800
state already so we' be growing this

1012
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Mar they're not

1013
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,359
growing so well it's yeah so it's it's

1014
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,400
growing on land that's not currently

1015
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:17,199
producing the product all right now that

1016
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,960
doesn't

1017
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:22,358
mean you're still making a choice to use

1018
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,599
all that land to produce biomass instead

1019
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:27,358
of additional you know food or food

1020
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,240
within within the food

1021
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,239
with

1022
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,599
theity cor c a

1023
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,960
COR okay

1024
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,880
yeah corn price wood

1025
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:59,279
pallets and other energy sources and

1026
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,280
forms

1027
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,960
of but then I well Steve's argument

1028
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:22,199
about using you could sort of extend

1029
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,920
that to say using nutrients to produce a

1030
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:28,118
fuel you don't need nutrients in a fuel

1031
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:32,200
but you do in a food or F so could we

1032
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:35,440
change that so then I look to see any of

1033
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:40,399
G anybody in G is

1034
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,200
looking breeding corn plant or any grain

1035
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,639
you get a lot of grain but no

1036
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,719
nutrients so that's the advantage of a

1037
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:51,039
tree right is that the

1038
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:54,000
trunk is it's

1039
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:58,599
not and and this is the disadvantage of

1040
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,719
the Agricultural Parts because we them

1041
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:05,480
and actually there there has been a

1042
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:08,879
little bit of done you know starting

1043
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,880
workout just

1044
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,599
one but I could I got

1045
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:23,440
frustrated I could find no nothing

1046
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,440
relevant to L Lang

1047
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,079
I mean what you want

1048
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,329
[Music]

1049
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:53,039
is we should stop it

1050
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,040
here another

1051
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:00,440
hand this has been a production of

1052
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:03,440
Cornell University on the web at

1053
