1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,919
okay hi

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,838
I'm Silva Hansen I'm excited to talk

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,179
with you all today about uh

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,618
participatory plant breeding and to get

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,719
a chance to be a part of the Cornell

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,339
plant science Community

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,500
um so today I'm going to talk to you

10
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,300
about participatory plant breeding and

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,278
variety trialing which are themes that

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,019
have connected my doctoral and

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,299
postdoctoral work in vegetable breeding

14
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,619
and that I now get to explore in my

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,500
current role with the cover crop reading

16
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:40,439
Network

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,378
so by way of introduction I've passed to

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,839
plant breeding started on the land I

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,820
grew up in Southwest Wisconsin

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,280
um where my Norwegian and German

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,399
ancestors settled in the mid to late

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,480
1800s on on Ho Chunk land

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,698
I was an outdoor kid I still am

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,738
I went to college and caught the organic

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,539
farming bug and then I spent eight

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,840
seasons as co-owner of a direct Market

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,439
vegetable farm in Northeast Iowa

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,700
for me farming tied together

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:15,118
environmental care working outside

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,359
business and marketing and caring for my

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,219
community I I saw it as a way to put

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,519
ethics into action and ethics into

33
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:26,099
tangible even edible form

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,938
but after selling that Farm after about

35
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,798
eight years I moved to Western New York

36
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,899
I got a job at Harris seeds up in

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,159
Rochester New York as organic product

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,259
manager

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,420
as a farmer I had

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,439
known

41
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,259
I'd observed the difference between

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,118
varieties and that a choice

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,459
the choice of variety made a lot of

44
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,799
difference in how well my farm was going

45
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,478
to do that year but as a product manager

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,159
I got to observe these differences

47
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,959
systematically

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,960
I didn't

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,859
however know how these differences came

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,438
about

51
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:05,640
but then came an organic plant breeding

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,179
Workshop in 2012 where I heard

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,098
um

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,000
folks including professors here at

55
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
Cornell

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,139
um

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,420
describe population creation selection

58
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,799
reproductive biology and I started to

59
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,439
think maybe this is something I could

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,420
learn also

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,859
so I made some contacts at University of

62
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,359
Wisconsin

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,220
um and

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,520
long story short ended up earning a

65
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,280
doctorate in uh in a beach breeding with

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,439
Dr Irwin Goldman at um at University of

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,360
Wisconsin and then I went on to do a

68
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,659
postdoc in participatory professional

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,379
breeding at UBC

70
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,598
foreign

71
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,699
before starting my plant breeding

72
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,500
stories I'm just going to take a beat to

73
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,280
recognize that I've

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,620
um

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,140
farmed and done research on the

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,879
ancestral traditional lands and

77
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,279
coercively acquired lands of many

78
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,979
different indigenous groups

79
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,598
land acknowledgments have gotten have

80
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,179
been aptly critiqued for being

81
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,098
perfunctory or performative

82
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,920
but I do think it's appropriate just to

83
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:10,079
hold the space to acknowledge that seed

84
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,539
as a way of literally making space on

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,519
the land for the people who eat those

86
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,799
crops and the farming systems that grow

87
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,459
those crops to

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
um

89
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,979
to sustain themselves

90
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,619
and that seed is used as a tool of

91
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,799
control and colonization even as it's

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,300
also used as a tool of sustenance

93
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,300
um so I'm just going to invite us to

94
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,219
hold that in awareness and to

95
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,140
hold an awareness who and what we're

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,500
making room for on the land when we do

97
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,500
our work

98
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,479
early in my plant breeding journey I

99
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,219
heard Bill Tracy was a farm breeder at

100
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,719
Wisconsin

101
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:51,239
uh talk about plant breeding as

102
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,158
conversation a multi-species

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,459
conversation most obviously between

104
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,318
humans and crop plants but with input

105
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,939
from the many other species that compose

106
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,759
an agro ecosystem

107
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,620
so this conversational Motif captured my

108
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,719
imagination and reminded me of my

109
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,060
experiences as a farmer where I'm

110
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,098
learning my land by trial and error by

111
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,780
my asking a question and getting an

112
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,818
answer from my land about what it could

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,620
do with what I was giving it

114
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,238
so when I learned that participatory

115
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,060
plant breeding was not just a concept

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,399
but a field with a literature and

117
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,720
researchers and practitioners I knew

118
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,478
that this was something I wanted to get

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,060
involved in so today I'm going to tell

120
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,579
two stories uh a participatory beat

121
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,319
reading story a participatory variety

122
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,319
trialing story and then talk about

123
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,639
possibilities for ways we can use these

124
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,639
techniques to um

125
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,379
to enhance

126
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,939
covering networks understanding of the

127
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,459
crops we're working with and help

128
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,459
Advance varieties toward farmer adoption

129
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,840
so participatory plant breeding is a

130
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,560
crop development strategy that

131
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,119
facilitates farmer-involved selection in

132
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,978
environments that diverge from

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,800
conventional plant breeding environments

134
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,258
it was developed in the global South

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,900
um with Farmers cultivating marginal

136
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,419
land but it's been adapted widely for

137
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,339
use in the global North specifically for

138
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:20,579
Farmers using organic and low input

139
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,478
practices so it facilitates

140
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,859
um

141
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,019
direct selection in the Target

142
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,639
environment which is often an organic or

143
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,500
low input environment instead of

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,079
indirect selection in a conventional

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,418
environment which in certain cases and

146
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,060
for certain traits can lead to better

147
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,359
response to selection for complex traits

148
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,899
like yield climatic adaptation and

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,900
flavor

150
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,120
ppv allows for marketing to start while

151
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,340
cultivars are being developed and it

152
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,899
also allows for Creative space and

153
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,299
relationships to build that can pay

154
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,899
dividends both during and after the

155
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,900
breeding process

156
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,460
participatory breeding projects take a

157
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,340
lot of different shapes uh there's a new

158
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:08,418
review of ppb in the global North by

159
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,859
Michaela Kali and she notes that

160
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:12,599
agronomic crop Improvement is only one

161
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,680
reason that people use participatory

162
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:20,160
techniques folks want to they may want

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,978
to preserve prep genetic diversity they

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
might want to pursue seed sovereignty or

165
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,180
seed security goals

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,220
or they might want to more closely

167
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,400
control the breeding techniques that are

168
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,400
used

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,100
my first story

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600
is about beets and it's going to require

171
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,699
a little bit of background on beet

172
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,570
flavor

173
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,439
which is coming now

174
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,659
[Laughter]

175
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,279
reference for table beef is very

176
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,500
Divergent my favorite thing about

177
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,379
working on table beat is that upon

178
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,079
learning such many people would tell me

179
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,180
that they love beats or hated beets

180
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,000
there hasn't been a lot of systematic

181
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,360
study of a holistic beet flavor but it's

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,478
generally agreed that sweet earthy

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,520
bitter and harsh attributes are are

184
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,099
present in beat and each associated with

185
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,698
one or several compounds

186
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,720
the earthy flavor is the one most

187
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,460
associated with preference or

188
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,500
non-preference for me so people think

189
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,459
beets are dirt candy or that they just

190
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,459
taste like dirt

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,660
earthy flavor and beat is conferred by G

192
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,579
Osmond this 12 carbon volatile molecule

193
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,080
which is synthesized by a wide variety

194
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,439
of soil microbes

195
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,598
it is the scent of freshly turned Earth

196
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,800
and it can be present in water and a

197
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,379
variety of different foods but it's

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,478
usually recognized as a contaminant

199
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,519
humans are very sensitive to this

200
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,519
molecule more so than many others

201
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,839
and a study that's almost as old as I am

202
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,538
connected Jasmine

203
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,818
earthy Aroma and the perception of quote

204
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,879
signature beet flavor

205
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,439
and So based on based on these

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,598
assumptions that Jasmine is present

207
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,180
people think beets are earthy and people

208
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,740
either do or don't like that earthy

209
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,780
flavor

210
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,418
um my lab at the University of Wisconsin

211
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,418
decided to investigate the um

212
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:23,519
the origin and genetic control of

213
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,439
geosmin and table B I could talk for a

214
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,939
long time about that but we are going to

215
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,279
cut to the chase

216
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,918
Yasmine is heritable and endogenously

217
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,259
produced by beep instead of being

218
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,338
absorbed by beet from the soil

219
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,158
environment

220
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:41,279
so despite the low resolution this

221
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,319
figure shows two two qtl two large

222
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,620
effect qtl for

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,940
um associated with GSM concentration in

224
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,759
table B

225
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,800
we've also shown Jasmine heritability in

226
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,439
both GB studies and this recurrent

227
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,000
selection experiment but this recurrent

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
selection experiment

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
um

230
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:06,360
dividend and that it produced these cool

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,360
beat populations with both extreme

232
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,379
geosmin concentration and segregating

233
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,019
color

234
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,720
so I looked at these and thought this is

235
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,100
a cool population for participatory

236
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,778
selection because it's that unique

237
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,159
flavor and it's got unique color and

238
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:22,159
both of those things are engaging

239
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,239
so the participatory beat breeding

240
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,759
project sought to develop some specialty

241
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,259
cultivars for particularly particularly

242
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,200
relevant in the organic and direct

243
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:38,879
Market uh Farm sector

244
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,060
and to gauge Jasmine preference in

245
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,580
non-laboratory conditions so I ran two

246
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,500
models and they each had three groups of

247
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,420
selectors so a farm group that would

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,600
select for Horticultural characteristics

249
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:53,458
and then two groups of hedonic selection

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,680
participants or people who told me how

251
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,838
much they like to eat the beets

252
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,338
um within the farm model all these

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
people were associated with a single

254
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,480
Farm south of Madison

255
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,119
and then in the Outreach model

256
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,519
all of the group that I took a survey of

257
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,799
farmers about two dozen farmers and then

258
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,379
both chefs and consumers convened by the

259
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,778
seed to Kitchen collaborative

260
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,759
um helped with this hedonic selection

261
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:19,740
and that's a program of the UW Court

262
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,958
department specifically Julie Dawson's

263
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,940
program

264
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,059
the first two cycles of participatory

265
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,000
selection followed this model

266
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,739
you'll see that it started with 30 half

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,379
of families of either high or low

268
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,019
Jasmine character that families were

269
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,759
eliminated at each step leaving which

270
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,399
I'll say more about in a bit

271
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,958
leaving five families to intermate and

272
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,958
create seed for the Next Generation

273
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,980
to guide Horticultural selection uh

274
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,560
Farmers rated the importance of various

275
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,120
traits on a one through five scale on a

276
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,879
survey or just in a conversation with

277
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,879
Steve Pincus The Farmer in the photo

278
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,458
um

279
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,100
Farmers indicated not unexpectedly that

280
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,199
high germination ability to out-compete

281
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,379
weeds and disease resistance were top

282
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,839
priorities uh for selection so I made a

283
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,659
selection index that waited traits by

284
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,180
farmer uh by farmer priority and then

285
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:23,278
also added qualitative comments

286
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:24,899
so using farmer priorities and and uh my

287
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,519
comments

288
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:32,159
a third of the families were eliminated

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,940
the remaining families I sorted into

290
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,860
groups based on their visual appearance

291
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,740
and then my hedonic selection

292
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,680
participants uh went to work I presented

293
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,720
all four groups to the core the core

294
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,578
group of selectors so that was chefs in

295
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,040
the Outreach model and Farm staff in the

296
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:51,778
farm model they narrowed it down to two

297
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,699
then I presented the last one to the

298
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,860
consumer group and they picked their

299
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,700
their favorite thing to be Advanced to

300
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,700
the Next Generation

301
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:08,100
we didn't find any uh any differences

302
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,319
between like in liking between high and

303
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,720
low geosman groups taken in aggregate

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
which is interesting given that um G

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Osmond and earthy flavor have been have

306
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,759
a were assumed to play a role in

307
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,039
preference or non-preference for B

308
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,659
we did find two big disparities in

309
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,879
liking and that was around appearance

310
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,338
and those came when we compared a white

311
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,559
bead group to a pigmented feed group so

312
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,380
on the order of 25 of people liking the

313
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,239
white group and about 80 percent liking

314
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,338
the pigmented group

315
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,919
but after trying them those differences

316
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,920
evened out they were both equally liked

317
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:46,379
suggesting that a favorable flavor made

318
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,919
up for this difference in in appearance

319
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,759
liking so this is interesting

320
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,879
um

321
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,159
in studies of expectation

322
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,740
um well

323
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,019
food with low color is often associated

324
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,680
with it with an expectation of low

325
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,820
flavor and if that happened here

326
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,739
um this would be a positive

327
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,620
disconfirmation of expectations or

328
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,539
getting more than you thought you would

329
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,480
which people like so that could explain

330
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:17,879
some of this phenomenon we saw

331
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,519
um notably both of these groups were

332
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,278
selected by chefs both of the groups

333
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,139
were acted by chefs whose job is to

334
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,620
create both Cuisine and expectations

335
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,419
around Cuisine so this is one of those

336
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,339
serendipitous benefits of having people

337
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,439
involved who think differently than you

338
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,560
do I wouldn't have selected the white

339
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,500
bead groups necessarily but they did and

340
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,219
consumers really liked them this is the

341
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,220
yes

342
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,820
after two generations or two two cycles

343
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,860
of that collection process that I showed

344
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,300
um the visual phenotypes were set so we

345
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,399
knew what we were heading for visually

346
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,078
so that same process didn't quite work

347
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,339
because there weren't colors to sort by

348
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,679
really

349
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,540
so we turned our participatory work

350
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,359
toward flavor

351
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,519
um flavor characterization

352
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,800
um and ended up with some cultivars so

353
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,139
on the low Jasmine side we had snow

354
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,539
globe and Evansville Ember

355
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,360
they're low Jasmine but it turns out

356
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,860
that many commercial cultivars are low G

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,539
Osmond that's just kind of what's out

358
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,120
there so they're not really unique in

359
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,338
that aspect but they're unique in the

360
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,078
fact that they were the result of

361
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,639
participatory selection which is

362
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,859
interesting some seed companies

363
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,899
especially those that

364
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,259
um that focus on the story of plant

365
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,600
breeding along with the products of it

366
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,120
one of those companies is fruition seeds

367
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,180
up in Naples really close to here they

368
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,919
serve gardeners and small-scale farmers

369
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,179
and

370
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,240
um

371
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:54,599
Evansville Ember they took on as part of

372
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,698
their offering but in a different form

373
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,339
um it really wanted to keep segregating

374
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,559
and the the farm uh

375
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,540
constituency kept saying we want a mild

376
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,879
red beet so we're selecting out the

377
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,458
other the other colors but clearly there

378
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,919
were recessive alleles at the two main

379
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:13,018
color locion beet and then a third one

380
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,479
that confers this

381
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,578
um blocky or dappled or tie-dyed

382
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,139
appearance so it's a really unique

383
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:21,359
population at this point and they're

384
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,459
letting it segregate because

385
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,680
um they think it's novel and it allows

386
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,659
them to tell a story about how about

387
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,879
plant breeding how populations change

388
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,799
from generation to generation and they

389
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,860
really want to embrace that and I love

390
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,159
that the cultivar is continuing to

391
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,680
evolve after it left my hands

392
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,500
and the hygiasmine side we had three

393
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,019
cultivars come out two Zone selections

394
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,940
one with a few more like uh coral and

395
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,799
magenta tones one selected to be a

396
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,779
little bit lighter and then this white

397
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,259
beet with pink petioles

398
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:57,240
so these are unique in their flavor

399
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,698
characteristics so they are higher

400
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,240
giosmin than basically every other beat

401
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,240
out there

402
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,120
um they're also unique in appearance so

403
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,578
the Zone beats are different in both

404
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,459
their Vigor and their pigmentation than

405
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,319
the the kyosha beat and the blushing

406
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,899
that bashful is the only pink pretty old

407
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,060
white meat that I know of

408
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,179
um flushing up bashful is being offered

409
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,679
by fruition seeds and Evansville orbit

410
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,958
um has been picked up by high mulling

411
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,458
organic seeds and that is in seed

412
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,599
production

413
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,578
um

414
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,000
so that's exciting to see them going

415
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:32,000
somewhere

416
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,659
so a range of intellectual property

417
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:42,360
agreements or Arrangements can be made

418
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:44,399
in participatory breeding programs the

419
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,440
best solutions for each situation are

420
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,559
highly context dependent

421
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,240
but the general goal is to share with

422
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,819
Farmers both

423
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,220
um money material benefits from the

424
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,220
varieties and also recognition for their

425
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,500
for their work in co-selection

426
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,600
our context was that this work was done

427
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,160
at the University of Wisconsin under a

428
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,380
federal hatch Grant using University

429
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,980
resources so the university Tech

430
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,319
transfer office Wharf had the first

431
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,179
first right to say what they wanted to

432
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,338
do for an intellectual property

433
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,540
Arrangement

434
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,899
um

435
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,459
they declined to PVP or use a plant

436
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,600
variety protection

437
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,179
um

438
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,939
certificate on these beats which is not

439
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,780
uncommon in the vegetable world

440
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,460
um

441
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,660
but they did reserve the right to

442
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,940
license them

443
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,580
uh which is

444
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,380
a common method that they use so in the

445
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:43,079
case of the farm

446
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,360
model the farmers were easily

447
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,939
identifiable as Steve finkus and Beth

448
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,399
casmar of pp produce

449
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,500
um but they decided they would love to

450
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,120
be recognized for their work but they

451
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,940
don't really they don't care about any

452
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,599
proceeds coming out of this

453
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,460
um

454
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:04,279
in the Outreach model the people

455
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,279
involved were really too numerous to um

456
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,840
to recognize this substantially and

457
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,640
certainly in terms of monetary payment

458
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,319
but the organization that seen them the

459
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,940
seed to Kitchen collaborative does uh

460
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,859
benefit from the royalties that come

461
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,980
through War so those royalties are

462
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,959
divided basically three ways between UW

463
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,360
Horticulture Department The Graduate

464
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,100
School and the inventors

465
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,859
um which are myself Irwin and Lynne

466
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,899
Mayer Who did the pre-breeding work

467
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,000
you know if you do the math like we

468
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,600
don't get to know

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,279
um

470
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,159
how much royalties are that's between

471
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,859
Wharf and the seed company but a fairly

472
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,980
nominal percentage of an overall sale

473
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:45,359
20 of that divided three ways is going

474
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,120
to be enough to like

475
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,918
get a coffee on

476
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,178
um which is fine I wasn't doing it to

477
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,740
get rich but um

478
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,660
my next participatory plant reading

479
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,558
story takes place north of the Border in

480
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,419
Canada

481
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,879
where I worked with the Canadian organic

482
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,919
vegetable Improvement project for Kenobi

483
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,919
this is a farmer collaborative project

484
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,200
launched in 2018 by the UBC Center for

485
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,120
sustainable Food Systems and the about

486
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,460
to family Initiative for Canadian seed

487
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,699
security which is a nationwide nonprofit

488
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,340
that works with several Regional

489
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,960
non-profits including Farm Folk City or

490
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:27,000
BC quite a mouthful and quite a network

491
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,759
well the beak breeding project was

492
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,380
driven by me a researcher with some cool

493
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,119
populations and some questions about

494
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,820
beet flavor

495
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,079
Kenobi was driven by farmers and farmer

496
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:41,279
advocates so the bout initiative had

497
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,538
coalesced farmers who are interested in

498
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,339
seed from both

499
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,099
um a biological and Horticultural

500
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:50,339
perspective but also an economic uh

501
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:53,219
political and ethical perspective so

502
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,839
they were very interested in um in seed

503
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,839
security

504
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,839
um

505
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,819
even though there are a lot of

506
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,980
um good seed companies serving organic

507
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,879
growers in North America there is a

508
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,819
border

509
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,679
and uh we've just been reminded recently

510
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:13,918
that um

511
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,080
various types of disruptions can

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,240
um can interrupt Supply chains right and

513
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,678
and borders do matter for that reason so

514
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,380
these folks are interested in building

515
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,179
both the knowledge and the community to

516
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,020
either Source or grow seed that they can

517
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,519
use

518
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,619
um north of the Border where they have

519
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,900
more control over it

520
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,178
um they were particularly interested in

521
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,220
sourcing uh open pollinated varieties

522
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,080
especially to compete with Workhorse

523
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,819
hybrids that they didn't want to rely on

524
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,918
since they can't

525
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:42,899
um count on them being on the market

526
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,940
from year to year

527
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,940
they're very interested in adaptation

528
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,120
regionally which obviously varies widely

529
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,519
across a place as big as Canada

530
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,719
so their goal was to identify and

531
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,480
develop

532
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,460
um vegetable varieties for for Canadian

533
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,798
Organic Farms so identify meaning

534
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,798
trialing and developing meaning breeding

535
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,519
the program did support a couple of

536
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,678
predatory plant breeding programs one in

537
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,900
sweet pepper one in carrots

538
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,480
but the biggest locusts of grower

539
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,720
engagement was in variety trialing

540
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,038
so or pvt for participatory variety

541
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,500
trialing

542
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,480
it is valuable in its own right in that

543
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,279
it just allows people to see varieties

544
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,620
on their farm when we survey people that

545
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,599
was the number one biggest benefit like

546
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,879
I get to see these things and also get

547
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,019
some Community to trade ideas with about

548
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,659
what we're seeing in our different

549
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,918
places

550
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:39,240
but getting to know more varieties than

551
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,980
you might if you had to purchase all the

552
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,259
seed yourself

553
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,960
um empowers people to shift varieties

554
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,759
more easily when there is a seed

555
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,058
shortage or when they just want to

556
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,919
diversify their crop offering

557
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:55,740
it helps them hone their observation

558
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,280
skills so we also heard on surveys that

559
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,839
um

560
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,399
you know I pay attention to what's

561
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,678
happening in my farm but I don't take

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,600
notes or like I never I wouldn't

563
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,220
discipline myself to go out every week

564
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,839
or every couple weeks to see how these

565
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,000
things were changing and this got me to

566
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,639
pay attention in a different way

567
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,679
um so that's a value

568
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,299
participatory variety trialing also

569
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,280
serves as an entry point for

570
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,139
participatory plant breeding

571
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,519
um in that it can identify Market niches

572
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,280
where there isn't anything on the market

573
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,400
that's really serving the purpose in a

574
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,379
given region or for a given Market it

575
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,840
can identify germplasm depending on what

576
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,299
you're trialing and it can build those

577
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,099
critical Pharma researcher relationships

578
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:38,720
which is where these good ideas for

579
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,719
projects uh get started

580
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,259
so variety Trail participants well we

581
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,759
can so there are participants spread all

582
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,220
the way across Canada we had about 60

583
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,599
participants per year some of whom

584
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,600
perfect thank you so much

585
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,340
um

586
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,559
some of them proud local crops in any

587
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:58,038
given year these were our 2022 trial

588
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,038
crops

589
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,940
oh how do I get back on here

590
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,240
okay

591
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,819
so the structure of Kenobi variety

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,339
trials were shaped by balancing the

593
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,678
Nationwide scale of the project with a

594
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:16,558
particular Regional interests so in the

595
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,019
case of this rutabaga trial we had a

596
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,579
core set of five varieties that everyone

597
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,500
was asked to trial and then they could

598
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,399
add on these other varieties that may be

599
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,720
more

600
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,820
um relevant to one region or another

601
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,279
especially Atlanta Canada has a strong

602
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,298
attachment to rutabaga

603
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,099
um

604
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:35,519
for ridicul trials we took a different

605
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:38,158
strategy and grouped the varieties by

606
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,839
days to maturity and Market class so

607
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,240
that say growers in Northern Canada

608
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,678
could only trial the short day varieties

609
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,359
which are the only ones that have a

610
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,360
chance of finishing during their season

611
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:54,779
we designated the plot size and the

612
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,279
approximate in-row spacing and suggested

613
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,259
planting dates for folks but we asked

614
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,819
them to use their normal their normal

615
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:01,319
maintenance techniques so these are all

616
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,178
organic farmers but whatever they would

617
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,000
normally do to maintain a crop so we

618
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:10,580
could get uh the most external validity

619
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,579
or the most uh real world validity

620
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:15,000
we use the seedlinked trialling platform

621
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,798
for data collection and results

622
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,740
visualization

623
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,538
this helped with uh consistency of data

624
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,620
formatting and just ease of data

625
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:27,779
collection compared to Google sheet

626
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:29,219
methods and you know taking a picture of

627
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,940
the clipboard where I took the notes

628
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,339
methods that had been used previously

629
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,080
for the years before I was there uh

630
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,019
participants used intuitive one through

631
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,899
five ratings on various traits

632
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,179
when I got there and found myself

633
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,620
equivocating over the course of a trial

634
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,620
session I thought like I would really

635
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,779
like I would like a rubric to tell me

636
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,359
um what each level is supposed to mean

637
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,918
so we piloted that we put out a rubric

638
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,959
like this

639
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,759
um specifying what levels of Trades

640
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,220
means and and what we're actually trying

641
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,319
to measure with each trait

642
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,140
and we got really good response so on

643
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,500
our season exit survey about 80 of

644
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,940
people uh said that rubric was easy to

645
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
use that had helped them in

646
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,179
understanding difference between trait

647
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,519
levels that helped them rate more

648
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:19,620
consistently among levels and I think

649
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,839
most importantly that they would trust

650
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:26,418
the data more this year knowing that

651
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,418
everyone had the same reference to use

652
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,259
also in response to a request for more

653
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,000
in-season communication that wasn't an

654
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:35,339
email because emails are often

655
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,319
overlooked during the busy season I

656
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,599
started making these trial videos from

657
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,579
the field when I would do ratings on my

658
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,219
own plots I would just give examples

659
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,119
this is one I'm giving a two and here's

660
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,860
why

661
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,979
people really liked this they were

662
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:54,019
conversational my face was dirty but it

663
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,019
was very very real

664
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,940
so after collecting data from

665
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,220
participants we presented results in a

666
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,740
few ways one of the benefits to using

667
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,558
seedlink is that immediately upon the

668
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,359
trials being closed interactive uh

669
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,519
visualizations are available for people

670
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,619
to play with so there are bar charts for

671
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,599
each trait there are these pie charts

672
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:18,199
that show the number of people who would

673
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:22,079
or wouldn't grow a certain variety again

674
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,360
there are also photo galleries and

675
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,980
uh comment galleries that are fun to

676
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,199
look through and really kind of flesh

677
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,099
out what might not be captured in

678
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,100
numeric ratings

679
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,100
we also heard from people though that

680
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,798
they wanted a printed report to be able

681
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,139
to refer back to without having to wait

682
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,720
into a website and play with variables

683
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,520
and as a researcher I wanted to subject

684
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,278
these things to some kind of statistical

685
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,339
analysis so we just did simple simple

686
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,798
anovas bar charts heat maps of means

687
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:56,220
tables and then a little

688
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,139
um simple explanation of uh what

689
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,298
statistical significance means

690
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,120
my

691
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:05,278
my phrase was the more bling the more

692
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,959
real the thing like the more chance it

693
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:07,980
is to be a result of Real differences

694
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,900
instead of

695
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,659
variation

696
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,278
okay just a couple examples of results

697
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,559
that we would offer so this was from our

698
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:19,319
carer trial this past year shows that

699
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,678
all traits accept appearance

700
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,019
um were more positive in

701
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,240
oh no all trades the subject appearance

702
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,278
showed some region effect

703
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,740
um and all the ratings were higher in

704
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,380
western Canada you'll notice that my

705
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,778
environmental variable is a very blunt

706
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,820
instrument of west or east because it

707
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,619
was I tried that in hardiness Zone and

708
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:44,158
hardiness zone or grouped hardiness

709
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:46,619
zones didn't show much effect but

710
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,020
um well I guess we did see the the same

711
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,699
ranking of varieties in both West and

712
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,639
East

713
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,140
um we saw no cases of G by e but that of

714
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,340
course doesn't mean that it wasn't there

715
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:01,020
it means that we only had Farm locations

716
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,298
um we we weren't integrating

717
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,158
environmental variables and that leaves

718
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,200
a lot of questions unanswered and a lot

719
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,600
of insights um

720
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,019
unseen I think so we'll say more about

721
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,019
that later

722
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,200
I like produced a variety somebody

723
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,080
summary for each for each variety this

724
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,000
is an example of the the butter of the

725
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,439
two

726
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,819
uh orthodontist carrot varieties that we

727
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,880
trialed

728
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:31,439
so taken together the numerical ratings

729
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,900
um we did some

730
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,940
some quantitative yield data with a

731
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,120
subset of Growers

732
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,400
you can you can get an idea of of what

733
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,678
the variety is of how much variation you

734
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,960
might see so a lot of variation in shape

735
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,640
for this Friday Also quite a bit of

736
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,079
variation in flavor ranging from

737
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,240
comments of water nothing flavor to two

738
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,639
is the best tasting care in the trial so

739
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,259
where it worked it really worked but it

740
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,820
was not consistent

741
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:03,619
um some some of the hybrids were very

742
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:06,538
consistent as you would you would expect

743
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:09,538
so we learned several things about

744
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:12,599
increasing trial completion rates

745
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:14,879
it's essential for Farmers to have input

746
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,099
into and feel enthusiastic about the

747
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,380
trial goals and the specific varieties

748
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,240
that that they're trialing

749
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,278
contact throughout the season is really

750
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,079
important because everybody's got a back

751
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,058
burn or something and you need to stay

752
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,639
in contact to make sure it's not the

753
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,200
trial as often as possible

754
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,000
um data collection needs to be easy

755
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
because people are balancing really busy

756
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,839
lives

757
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,058
and if possible a stipend or some kind

758
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,398
of compensation really helps these

759
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,678
farmers were compensated 300 Canadian

760
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,538
for a completed trial

761
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,059
um and when I did interviews everybody

762
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:50,879
but one person mentioned unprompted that

763
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:52,859
they really appreciated the payment

764
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,500
um but that's an end of nine so go

765
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,538
figure I know I know sometimes people

766
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,700
participate in Trials like this for free

767
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:02,240
it really just depends on what the

768
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,240
context is

769
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,360
from these those interviews I also

770
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,120
gleaned a couple

771
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,319
important points and one are that you

772
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,439
know I was asking all these questions

773
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,658
about like is this information useful to

774
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,759
you and one woman said well you know

775
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,200
it's really whether it's usable rather

776
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,359
than useful because like just because

777
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,500
I've participated in a Radicchio trial

778
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,898
this year doesn't mean I'm really

779
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,000
necessarily in the market for an eqc

780
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,619
next year but if I needed the

781
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,778
information's there I can interpret it

782
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,359
easily and that's the goal I thought

783
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:34,140
okay that makes sense

784
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,240
um

785
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,700
and also just over and over it hit home

786
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,399
that these trials are part of very busy

787
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,340
lives and farm businesses so we need to

788
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:47,099
come we need to come humbly with easily

789
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:48,720
with Easy instructions and um and just

790
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:50,158
know that people are juggling a lot to

791
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,778
be able to give us

792
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,960
um the the feedback that we're looking

793
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:58,079
for and that in order to maintain the

794
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,679
relationship we need to reciprocate with

795
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:05,359
um useful or usable information

796
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
um in a timely manner

797
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,538
so I didn't cover the details of the

798
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,038
Kenobi participatory breeding programs

799
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:12,720
but I just want to highlight a different

800
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,819
option that they used for

801
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,399
commercialization

802
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,538
um these the open source seed initiative

803
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,898
pledge

804
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:24,480
which is um modeled over after open

805
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:27,898
source software is any anyone familiar

806
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,519
with Aussie I imagine some folks are

807
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:35,579
um so basically it's that anyone is uh

808
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,980
permitted to use the seed to grow it to

809
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:40,079
sell the seed to breed with it but then

810
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,880
any derivatives from that seed also need

811
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,759
to be open source

812
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,580
so this is clear well it's clearly not

813
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,099
appealing to larger commercial interests

814
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,500
oh it's not legally binding

815
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:55,379
um but the effect has been to create a

816
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,599
pool of Open Source germplasm that is

817
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,960
used by and curated by smaller scale

818
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,798
breeders on Farm breeders who value

819
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,960
um

820
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,480
Regional variety adaptation and

821
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,200
preservation of culturally important uh

822
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,200
cultivars

823
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,599
the osteopledge doesn't preclude

824
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,918
charging royalties

825
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,219
um they have not they're not interested

826
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,000
in that but the kitchen table seat house

827
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,100
um

828
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,839
is offering the Renegade red pepper and

829
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:23,459
that they were one of the main Pharma

830
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,558
breeders involved the carrots have yet

831
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,740
to meet the market but hopefully they

832
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:27,740
will

833
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,240
and so now we're in the present what

834
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,239
we're doing on time I'm okay uh yes

835
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,440
so as many of you know the cover crop

836
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,798
reading Network since 2015 has been

837
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,659
reading fall zone legume props legume

838
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,058
cover crops for traits like fall

839
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,179
emergence Winter survival spring Vigor

840
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:54,058
High biomass hard seed not shattering

841
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,460
pods and just last year we began

842
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,940
breeding cereal Rye specifically for

843
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,399
cover crop purposes

844
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,620
the Network's first uh Harry vetch

845
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:07,678
variety and the first few pea varieties

846
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:10,798
winter pea varieties are moving toward

847
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:15,120
release this year which is exciting

848
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:18,298
this map shows sites of uh

849
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,579
University and ARS breeding and trialing

850
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,220
sites in purple and pink and then a few

851
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:25,439
orange orange dots with some on-farm

852
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,839
reading sites

853
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,600
so the Growers at those orange pins

854
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,759
worked with Lisa kissing Cusick who is a

855
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,759
Cornell grad who's now at the ARs in

856
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,419
Wisconsin on a winter pea participatory

857
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,579
reading project from 2016 to 2018.

858
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,200
of the six pea varieties that are

859
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,359
consistently beating checks in our

860
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,519
Advanced line trials or we're actually

861
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,719
farmer selections

862
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,720
so

863
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,919
the method briefly was that each farmer

864
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,360
received five F4 P crosses from the

865
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,100
heiress breeder that we're collaborating

866
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,859
with in Washington

867
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:04,500
according to the the their breeding

868
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:08,639
priorities for Peas on their Farm

869
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,858
So the plan was to um

870
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,960
plant them out care for them according

871
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:15,358
to the farmer's normal practices and

872
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,460
then use a flagging system to select

873
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,619
plants for various traits in each

874
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,398
quadrant of the plot

875
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:25,139
and and then like the best 10 of of the

876
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,079
plots for

877
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,059
um recombining and another selection the

878
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,539
following year

879
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:35,519
the weather had different plans

880
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:36,659
a more parsimonious solution

881
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,639
um

882
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,619
to just freeze everything except for

883
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,019
about 10 of the plants so that was a

884
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,639
much simpler selection process but

885
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,280
really did produce some remarkably

886
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,179
winter hardy lines

887
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,820
um

888
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,320
and the the plan was to bulk seed and

889
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
replant the next year for various

890
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,260
reasons that didn't work out but we

891
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,940
still got a really

892
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:02,060
um we we got an effective results

893
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,059
um

894
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:09,440
yes so four of them are on our list for

895
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,439
release this year

896
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,539
intellectual property arrangements for

897
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,599
these peas will be guided by the ARs

898
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,980
System since the initial crosses for all

899
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,019
but one of the varieties came from the

900
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,219
ARs breeder Rebecca McGee out in

901
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,259
Washington

902
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,078
so we're hoping to make them public

903
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,720
releases such that a deposit will be

904
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,519
held in grin and will be available

905
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,618
publicly but that we can maintain stock

906
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,320
seed and provide it to seed companies

907
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:40,079
for trialing Etc

908
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,220
um for the farmer selected lines

909
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,320
two of the farmers who participated run

910
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:49,078
uh one run the seed company prayer Road

911
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,519
organic seed in North Dakota

912
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,039
right yes

913
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,300
um and then do the farm sells various

914
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,639
farm products out there Farm in

915
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,980
Wisconsin so they are the first right of

916
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,779
refusal for using those varieties on

917
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,179
their farm and then they can choose to

918
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,260
also make them available to other seed

919
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:05,879
companies

920
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,579
and then they

921
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,680
they also have a right to we we haven't

922
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,180
been aiming to collect royalties on any

923
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,659
of this but if we did they would receive

924
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,659
a share of that

925
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,280
so while our trial Network allows

926
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,440
trialing

927
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,060
um selection and trialing in many

928
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,980
environments there are only a few

929
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,380
locations that are cold enough to really

930
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,559
provide selection pressure or evaluation

931
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,440
pressure for winter survival so to more

932
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,480
thoroughly test it and to introduce

933
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,358
these winter peas or winter peas as

934
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,880
cover crops at all to Farmers

935
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,119
this fall we are planning small scale

936
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,920
winter pea trials with uh we're hoping

937
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,780
to roll out with 60 farmers and we're

938
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,119
hoping to get data back from 40 of them

939
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,859
we'll see how that ratio plays out

940
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,599
we're going to use the seedling platform

941
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,279
that I described previously but we're

942
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,338
going to use a

943
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,619
a model where each farmer will receive a

944
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:03,719
subset of three varieties from the total

945
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,180
of six along with one consistent check

946
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,639
so this is a variation of the tricot

947
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,919
design which stands for triadic

948
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,539
comparison of three which was proposed

949
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,380
by Jacob Bennett and Lacey knotting

950
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:19,880
heads a few years ago and it basically

951
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,559
conducts statistical analysis by uh

952
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,740
comparison

953
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:28,139
by comparing rank among uh among

954
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:31,919
cultivars instead of by asking Farmers

955
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:33,539
to to phenotype or things like that

956
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,019
I guess it creates ranks out of

957
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:36,019
phenotype

958
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,460
but beyond those trials

959
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,380
um this season which will be on a

960
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,780
relatively small scale

961
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,240
how could we use participatory methods

962
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,300
or Community science methods to inform

963
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,699
our work and to expand the reach of

964
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,079
these cultivars that we're producing so

965
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:57,739
we already have plans for the

966
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,240
participatory work so three of the most

967
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:03,059
engaged viable Growers from the

968
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,159
participatory P breeding project have

969
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:08,099
re-engaged they have peas in their

970
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,259
fields this year and we are excited to

971
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,338
see what comes out of it

972
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,640
um

973
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:16,980
and in addition some ideas are

974
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,259
coalescing in the literature and in

975
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,358
practice around a community science

976
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,820
approach to participatory variety

977
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,980
trialing some of some elements of which

978
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,579
showed up in the Kenobi project and even

979
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:33,119
the the beat reading project

980
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,119
um so features of this approach are

981
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,338
having multiple points of Entry so not

982
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,380
everybody has to have a full-on

983
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:43,078
selection experiment at their Farm every

984
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,579
year variety trials especially smaller

985
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,800
scale ones where you maybe only have

986
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:48,839
three things to compare

987
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,260
um are often easier for Farmers to

988
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:54,179
commit to they're also even lower Stakes

989
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,900
ways to engage like participatory field

990
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:59,699
days where Farmers might flag or rate on

991
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,338
a survey

992
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:04,739
um breeding lines or varieties that they

993
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:06,539
find particularly appealing

994
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:08,459
okay

995
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:10,500
these Community science approaches make

996
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,260
use of um

997
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:17,039
the ubiquitous digital technology that's

998
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,780
around us so data submission using

999
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,539
various manners of smartphone apps

1000
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:26,220
sometimes soil monitoring devices that

1001
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:28,279
are low cost and and easy and small

1002
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:28,279
um

1003
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,720
using modern data science to derive

1004
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:39,259
meaning from Big noisy decentralized

1005
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,358
on-farm data

1006
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,420
this method was was introduced by Jacob

1007
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:47,400
Bennett's group at seat in 2019 or at

1008
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,740
least that's when it was published and

1009
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,980
several several recent Studies have

1010
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:54,919
built on this design

1011
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,119
one using Bean in Central America

1012
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,780
integrated weather data with farmer

1013
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,640
observations to discover drivers of

1014
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,800
environmental variation and then predict

1015
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,319
variety suitability for various regions

1016
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,960
in much more precise ways than than

1017
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,960
could have been done before a group

1018
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,300
including Jean Luke recently published

1019
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,400
on the way data-driven decentralized

1020
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,920
breeding can improve genomic prediction

1021
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,940
you folks worked on wheat

1022
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,139
um

1023
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,599
because this decentralized model allows

1024
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:30,480
scaling of environmental and management

1025
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,599
data to meet the scale of genomic data

1026
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,300
which is very interesting

1027
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,000
and Holly tupon was also part of the

1028
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,500
brand new pnas paper describing how

1029
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,159
these data-driven approaches can

1030
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,599
incorporate social data

1031
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,858
environmental data

1032
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,180
um

1033
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:52,500
even economic data so like being able to

1034
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:53,940
reflect some of these values that

1035
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,280
surround breeding

1036
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,079
um in addition to crop agronomic

1037
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,940
performance so these are all very

1038
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,859
intriguing ideas and could have

1039
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,838
relevance to our work

1040
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:05,880
I'm I'm interested in the Big Data

1041
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,799
approaches potentially because we have a

1042
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,680
big Network right so we're spread over

1043
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,720
all these institutions who each have

1044
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,578
connections with groups of farmers that

1045
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,679
are already coalesced and already have

1046
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,140
interest in in cover crops

1047
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:21,779
so

1048
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:24,299
convening the people is

1049
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,220
um is possible

1050
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,619
these approach approaches have been used

1051
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:32,159
in the global South thus far but cover

1052
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,980
crops provide somewhat of a parallel use

1053
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,420
case in the global North in that these

1054
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,699
crops are

1055
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:42,539
not as far along the domestication

1056
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:45,598
spectrum and it's common to find both

1057
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,719
name varieties and farmer-saved seed or

1058
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,579
a variety not stated seed

1059
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:54,199
coexisting in this seed system so so in

1060
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,200
that way the situations are similar

1061
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,259
um a lot of elements of the network that

1062
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,260
we that are not skilled to this level

1063
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,060
but in terms of an initial idea I think

1064
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,859
it's an initial idea

1065
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,358
um and we are parting the tri-cut

1066
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,460
technique in our in our smaller scale

1067
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,679
trials this season we'll see how that

1068
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,079
goes we'll see what responses what we

1069
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,940
need to do to you know maximize

1070
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,019
engagement

1071
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,760
um

1072
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:19,800
and one potential I see is that we're

1073
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,720
just starting to work with Rye

1074
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,119
um which has a lot more genomic tools

1075
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,739
available at this point than our legume

1076
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,559
cover crops

1077
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:31,618
um but last point is

1078
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,960
however big our data gets and however

1079
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,320
refined our predictions can be

1080
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,900
we know that um

1081
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,599
trust between farmers and researchers is

1082
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,980
absolutely essential in determining the

1083
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,359
way

1084
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,858
um any information that comes out of our

1085
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,219
Network and any varieties that come out

1086
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:51,299
of our Network actually meet the land

1087
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,299
um

1088
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,060
so that's what I've got thank you for

1089
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,400
your attention and to all the funders of

1090
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:03,139
all these projects I've presented on

1091
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,139
and I'll be happy to take questions

1092
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,199
yeah

1093
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,200
um well for the Kenobi trials

1094
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,199
um

1095
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,920
the benefit of working with these

1096
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,900
Regional groups is that they each have a

1097
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,400
there are five about to initiative

1098
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,519
Regional coordinators and three of them

1099
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,099
work for these Regional orgs so and they

1100
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,900
have a lot of longevity in their

1101
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,640
position so they have these trusted

1102
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,780
relationships

1103
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,818
um

1104
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,500
so they were recruited through the

1105
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,659
through those networks

1106
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,818
um we would give uh you know Season

1107
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:44,219
kickoff webinars for folks who are

1108
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:46,318
signed up or folks folks who are um on

1109
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,598
the fence to communicate directly

1110
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,699
between like me as the project manager

1111
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,140
and the farmers but like the biggest

1112
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:53,699
connections came through the regional

1113
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,799
coordinators

1114
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:58,019
um

1115
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,700
yeah so like coordinating with groups

1116
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:02,519
that already exist is really essential

1117
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,659
because like a network that big is

1118
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,000
really

1119
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,598
it's not wise to make it hinge on one

1120
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,539
person or one coordinator yeah

1121
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,240
yeah before the cover crop Network I'm

1122
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:18,119
assuming most farmers who you're having

1123
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,098
participated haven't run these mixtures

1124
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,318
before making them management

1125
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,660
recommendations on how to manage that

1126
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,179
bot yeah

1127
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,318
I mean I'm newer to the cover crop world

1128
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,618
so like

1129
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,858
but what I'm gathering is some people

1130
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,539
have grown false own cover crops and you

1131
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:38,639
know are

1132
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,920
are used to the growing cycle a lot of

1133
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,598
people haven't so yeah we'll we'll give

1134
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,280
um we'll give sewing recommendations for

1135
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,960
sure

1136
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,400
um and I don't know we'll have to talk

1137
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,500
about how we structure it in terms of

1138
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,358
there will be some Regional specificity

1139
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,639
so we can like suggest planting dates

1140
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,460
for your region but um like what we did

1141
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,559
with Kenobi was

1142
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,119
you know if you if you learn by

1143
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,380
conversation that

1144
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,240
a different planning date is better

1145
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,099
please do that because like bottom line

1146
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,679
is we want them to survive and then like

1147
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:11,039
tell us what you did

1148
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,899
um yeah so like enough guidelines that

1149
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,338
so that they get a crop to survive if

1150
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,780
it's going to you know if winter doesn't

1151
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,880
kill it

1152
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,099
um but

1153
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,500
so that it

1154
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,579
so that our results reflect

1155
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,139
um

1156
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,060
the kind of on-farm management people

1157
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,219
could actually do

1158
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,659
um yeah

1159
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:33,118
yeah

1160
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:35,159
um very cool talk thanks so much

1161
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,059
um something that surprised me I guess

1162
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,338
is how much you talked about

1163
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:40,858
intellectual property yeah and I

1164
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:43,259
wondered how soon you begin that

1165
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:46,199
conversation with you start working with

1166
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,300
Margaret like ideally right away like

1167
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,358
before you agree to do it

1168
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,359
um

1169
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:55,259
again it really depends on the context

1170
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,779
um but if you're working especially

1171
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,520
through an institution like like this

1172
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,619
like it's really important to make sure

1173
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,480
that you know the tech transfer folks

1174
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,000
are on board with what's your what Your

1175
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,818
Ideas are are you received from them

1176
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,099
what your restrictions might be

1177
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:12,960
um so that you don't get surprised

1178
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,240
um because it I think the saddest thing

1179
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,280
is to make something cool and then

1180
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,858
have it either not get out into the

1181
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,960
world or have it get out in a way that

1182
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:23,578
ruptures that relationship between you

1183
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,019
and the farmer

1184
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,119
um so yeah

1185
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:32,239
as soon as possible

1186
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,240
but it's a complex landscape so yeah

1187
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:36,480
yeah related is it something that you're

1188
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,338
interested in or is it just like oh my

1189
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,639
God I have to do this

1190
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:43,139
um no in fact I those slides are new as

1191
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:45,118
of yesterday because I gave a practice

1192
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:47,219
presentation to

1193
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,740
um the CCB lab group and they were like

1194
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,500
host but IP and I was like oh God okay

1195
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:54,779
so um

1196
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,318
I mean it's a

1197
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,119
it's inescapable in the in in the seed

1198
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,338
system as it is now we can't pretend it

1199
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,519
doesn't exist and um

1200
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:07,440
it's a great place to like have to put

1201
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,599
into practice

1202
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,338
whatever values we want to bring to this

1203
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,260
thing and like and to negotiate

1204
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:13,858
compromises because

1205
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,200
um

1206
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:17,818
you know the the Wisconsin beefs like

1207
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:19,318
you know royalties are going back to the

1208
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:21,179
university and people can have various

1209
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,519
feelings about that but we just decided

1210
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:26,159
Well it's

1211
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,838
funding more grad work and you know I

1212
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,098
was indirectly funded by things like

1213
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,179
that through the grad school and the

1214
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,180
court department so

1215
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:43,740
this has been a production of Cornell

1216
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,740
