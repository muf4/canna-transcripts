1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,199
i want to thank the committee and allen

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,759
for this opportunity to

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,719
give an update on some of the things

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
that

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,839
we have going on with compatibility uh

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
for fungicides and insecticide seed

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,839
treatments with rhizobia and biocontrol

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,598
agents i think this is a really

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,278
interesting topic

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
and a lot of times when i'm asked to

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,799
give a presentation

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,159
uh these type of talks

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,000
to groups like this are really

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,439
interesting to me because it's

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
a topic that's a little bit different

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,759
than i'm normally used to talking to

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,679
which is

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,359
more about how our products work and

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280
efficacy and things like that but

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,799
when i give one of these talks i do

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
quite a bit of research and i tend to

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,280
learn a lot about

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,198
uh this this new topic and it was in

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
this case too that i really

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,558
felt like i was able to learn some

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
things so i hope that

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,239
through this time that we spend here in

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
the next few minutes i can

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
give you some of that information that i

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
learned and that you'll find it

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
interesting

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,759
so rhizobia are

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
important in legume crops for increased

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,879
nodulation

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,719
and nitrogen management their use

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,920
decreases the need for synthetic

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,359
fertilizers

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,200
and helps growers far more sustainably

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:34,239
rhizobia products are often

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,560
seed applied and the advances in seed

43
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,039
applied bio control agents have

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,719
also occurred in recent years and many

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
new products are being brought to the

46
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,840
market and are often seed applied as

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
well

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
fungicide insecticide seed treatments

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
are still very valuable to growers and

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,438
the compatibility of these different

51
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,599
products are very important

52
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,438
to ensure that growers are getting the

53
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,718
expected benefit of all the products

54
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,239
applied

55
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,239
rhizobia and bio control compatibility

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,239
begins with the design of the fungicide

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,158
or insecticide formulation

58
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,038
and includes the active ingredient as

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
well as the choice of inert ingredients

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,079
the compatibility is evaluated at

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
several stages

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
which i'll go through through the

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
development products

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,080
process and is often checked by rhizobia

65
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,679
product companies as well before

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
commercialization

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
and also responsible bio-controlled

68
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,919
product companies are also testing for

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
compatibility of their products

70
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,719
when it makes sense and they believe

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
that their product is going to be

72
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,519
applied as a seed treatment

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,879
and by working together the industries

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,439
really trying hard

75
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,199
to make sure that these products are

76
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,800
working together in effect can be used

77
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,878
effectively

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,680
to uh the best maximize the yield and

79
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,679
farm

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,560
sustainability so that's uh in a summary

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
really what i've been trying i want to

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,199
share with you today and i'm going to go

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,479
into a lot more

84
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,959
detail now about about these so

85
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,639
as you know rhizobium is a genus of soil

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
bacteria

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,199
and the fact that it's bacteria means

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
that this is a living organism that's

89
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,359
being applied to the seed and that

90
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,119
brings

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
certain considerations that we need to

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,120
think about

93
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,199
an important feature of these rhizobium

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,400
is that they're very specific

95
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,679
to the the legume

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
or that they're being applied to so some

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
of them

98
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,839
have very are only specific to of a very

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
small

100
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:41,199
amount of the crops for example

101
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:45,280
some of them are only only

102
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,439
nodulate on alfalfa species

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
whereas other rhizobium can be very

104
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,120
broad broad spectrum across a number of

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,959
of crops

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,000
for for us there's a rhizobium legume

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,438
sorum is nodulates on pea crops

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,719
and brady japonicum nodulates in

109
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,560
soybeans

110
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,318
this is important because we're not just

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
talking about one specific

112
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,518
uh bacterial organism that

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
is applied across all crops that we need

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
to worry about

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
but there's many different

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,918
rhizobia species that we have to think

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,320
about and test for when we're talking

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
about compatibility with

119
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,839
seed treatments that are also going on

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,839
that same space on the seed

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,800
and i just have a picture here of you

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,280
can see the nodulation on the roots

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
so what we're talking about is the uh

124
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,319
these rhizobia that are applied to the

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
seed and then

126
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:47,040
or in furrow in some cases and then

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,639
cause these nodulations and what this is

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
really doing is this uh

129
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
rhizobia bacteria is colonizing the

130
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,119
plant cells

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,959
within root nodules and they're they

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
convert atmospheric nitrogen into

133
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,359
ammonia causing the enzyme

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,759
nitrogenase and then provide organic

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,560
nitrogenous compounds such as glutamine

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
or urides to the plant so it's really

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
helping the plant

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
the plant in turn is providing the

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,519
bacteria with organic compounds

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,840
made by photosynthesis and this is a

141
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,879
mutually beneficial relationship

142
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,519
and it is true of rhizobia which is

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,759
example

144
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,839
which of which the genus rhizobium is a

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,360
typical

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,079
so this mutually beneficial relationship

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
is something that we really want to make

148
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,758
sure we're protecting and

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
make sure that we're taking advantage of

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,038
especially when we're trying to reduce

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
fertilizer

152
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,719
use synthetic fertilizer use as much as

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,399
possible

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
we want to try to increase our soil

155
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,719
health

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
so rhizobium can be formulated with

157
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,038
other micro microorganisms

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
as well to improve or add additional

159
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,519
benefits

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,879
and i i've just taken a snip here from

161
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,359
a nova zyme's document and you can see

162
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,159
that there's a rhizobian legion of sorum

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,038
but there's also penicillium on here as

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
well

165
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,639
and these uh rhizobium products can

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
actually take different

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,400
carriers or different forms you can have

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
peat

169
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,679
you can have granulars or you could have

170
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,519
liquid inoculants

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
so all of these need to be considered as

172
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,839
well

173
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,000
so that's a little bit about the

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,079
rhizobium

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
but what about a seed treatment and

176
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,800
although it sometimes might seem like it

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
uh

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
you know you just had a nice talk from

179
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,159
peter marks and

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
you can make these seeds look really

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
nice and it might seem like it's about

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
the colors and the shiny

183
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,600
shiny appearance it's it's more about

184
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,959
the how what what the products are doing

185
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
to protect them against

186
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,478
insects nematodes and diseases which are

187
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,918
mainly

188
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,918
mainly fungi and these have been very uh

189
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,598
useful to growers and they're getting a

190
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,240
lot of benefit out of them you can see

191
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,879
here

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
if you have an untreated seeds and you

193
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,159
have planted

194
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,279
in the presence of pythium sometimes

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
you'll

196
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,598
basically get no plants but a treated

197
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,719
seed can protect you from

198
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,519
pythium and this can be demonstrated in

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,039
little rhizotrons like this where we've

200
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,198
inoculated the soil

201
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,240
we can also do petri plate studies you

202
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,840
can see here

203
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,160
an untreated petri plate with

204
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,399
rhizoctonia in the center and the

205
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
rhizoctonia mycelium growing out across

206
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,758
the seeds

207
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,519
whereas the treated seeds are protected

208
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,080
from the rhizoctonia

209
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,439
and this is the benefit that these seed

210
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,800
treatments are

211
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,680
are giving to growers so we want to be

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,598
able to

213
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,639
combine both of these technologies

214
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,680
together and be able to use them

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,598
efficiently we want them both to perform

216
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,759
well when we're talking about the

217
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,240
pesticide formulation

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
there is the pesticide active ingredient

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
that is the main

220
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,959
component that we're talking about

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
that's the thing that's going to be

222
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,399
controlling the pest there's carriers

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
uh water or organic solvents that are

224
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,359
also in those formulations

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,080
these are all the inner of the inert or

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
other ingredients and we're when we're

227
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,478
talking about compatibility with

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,199
something like a

229
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,000
rhizobium or bacteria we really need to

230
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
consider

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,079
all of these inert ingredients as well

232
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,478
as the

233
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,240
active ingredient other things that can

234
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,680
be in there are surfactants

235
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,918
or adjuvants stabilizers you can have

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,959
dyes or colorants

237
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,478
and safeners as well as antifreezes to

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,199
keep it from freezing

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
in cold temperatures another thing that

240
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
is often or

241
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,120
almost always put into a

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,639
pesticide formulation or a seed

243
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,519
treatment formulation

244
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,519
are synthetic biocides so the synthetic

245
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,000
biocides are placed in there so we don't

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
get bacterial contamination growing in

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
the

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,919
in the jug if you've ever opened a jug

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
and it smells really bad

250
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,759
you know you have some bacterial

251
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,399
contamination

252
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,879
and the biocides weren't doing their job

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,919
so

254
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,159
these are all uh components of a

255
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,519
seed treatment formulation and you can

256
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,799
see that some of these are going to

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,639
cause some problems

258
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,159
when you're trying to be compatible with

259
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,039
an organic or a

260
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,120
with an organism that's a living organic

261
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,399
solvents uh biopest

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,759
biocides could be could be an issue

263
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
and so we need to uh take care of that

264
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,519
and how

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,399
how are we gonna do that um

266
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
i just wanna say you know syngentis has

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
a long history of developing these

268
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,479
things we've been

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
doing this for over 40 years and we

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,278
spend a lot of money and time

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,200
investing in our formulations nearly 4

272
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,679
million dollars a day and we don't want

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,879
to

274
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,958
have a product that is going to

275
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,720
come to the market and not be successful

276
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,799
or not be able to be used

277
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,040
because of its incompatibility with

278
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,958
with the rhizobium or another bio

279
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,319
control product that our growers

280
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,239
really want to apply to help us with

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
this we do have dedicated seed care

282
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,560
specialists around the country that

283
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,480
listen to grow listen to growers and try

284
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,199
to understand how our products are

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
working

286
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
and there also can be resources for you

287
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,078
if you're having an issue with one of

288
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,039
our products or have questions about

289
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,159
them you can always

290
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:29,360
contact one of them we have

291
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,879
a facility in minnesota which is a seed

292
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,079
care institute where we do a lot of

293
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,559
training

294
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,838
but this is also where we do application

295
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,399
testing

296
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,959
like peter was talking about and we have

297
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,720
uh inoculum testing program as well as

298
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,719
our seed safety testing program

299
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,600
so what does syngenta do to keep our

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,600
products compatible with inoculants uh

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
actually in the formulation development

302
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
of a new

303
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,439
seed treatment we do do tests for

304
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,480
compatibility

305
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:08,160
and these tests are might primarily

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,320
to put the product on the seed after

307
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,240
well we applied treat the seed and then

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
we put the inoculum on top

309
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,039
and then we'll see how long those uh

310
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,479
inoculum last on the seed or how long it

311
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,399
survives on the seed

312
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
and we have a certain threshold that we

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,639
want to maintain

314
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,320
for the number of a bacterial

315
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,720
bacteria that are still alive on the

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
seed after a certain amount of time

317
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,560
and so we do test that in the

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,320
development process

319
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,919
we only test a few of those to make sure

320
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
that this products

321
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,679
not not a significant issue and if it

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,360
passes that test

323
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,120
then we'll continue with the development

324
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
of that formulation and we feel that it

325
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,759
will be successful

326
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
we'll go ahead and freeze that

327
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,120
formulation and

328
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,519
commercialize it however before

329
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,039
after kind of after the the products

330
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
frozen or we've got a good

331
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,559
idea of what that product is going to be

332
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,679
we've gone through some tests

333
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,559
we will offer our products for testing

334
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,278
to other

335
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,119
inoculant manufacturers for testing

336
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,120
prior to commercialization and if we

337
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,240
come back and there's some big issues

338
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,560
we will uh withhold that

339
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
product from the marketplace currently

340
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,039
the only company that's really been

341
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
taking us

342
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,879
up on this offer is novazymes so i'm

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,759
going to be sharing some

344
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,759
information from novazymes but we do

345
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,120
they do test the compatibility of all

346
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,759
our new formulations and

347
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
treatments with with their inoculant

348
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,679
products and

349
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,519
it's something that syngenta doesn't

350
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,399
really have the expertise to do in-house

351
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,399
so we have

352
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,078
the inoculant companies are really good

353
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,159
at testing those things

354
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,879
and we have them them do that and when

355
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,199
they give us back the information

356
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,000
and then they publish it in a guide so

357
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
you can download

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,679
this guide you know i did last week from

359
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,120
from novazymes and it's a compatibility

360
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,399
guide and it gives you

361
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,000
by crop all of the different products

362
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,958
that they have i've just taken a snip

363
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,360
of one of them which is tag team pete

364
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,399
and then it lists all of the

365
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,519
products that have been

366
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,078
tested by syngenta or i'm

367
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,039
tested by novazones i'm sorry and you

368
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,199
can see there's a

369
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,799
pretty big list of those products here

370
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,480
and i just want to highlight a few

371
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,559
this one is a apron max rfc the rfc

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,440
actually stood for rhizobium friendly

373
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,319
constant concentrate we did make some

374
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,680
modifications to the formulation

375
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,240
to help it be more uh friendly to

376
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,719
to rhizobium actually than the original

377
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,919
aprimax rta formulation and you can see

378
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
that it did

379
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,120
seem to improve the planting window and

380
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,039
this planting window is actually

381
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,879
the maximum amount of time that can

382
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,799
elapse between the date the seed was

383
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,000
treated with the bio

384
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,799
bioenhancer or rhizobium

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,159
and when it can be planted within

386
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,599
expectation

387
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,480
that the rhizobium will remain viable

388
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,278
and generally this is uh i've seen these

389
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,959
really the the maxim here is 48 hours on

390
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,198
all of these

391
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,879
tests that they do however we know from

392
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,399
some of our internal testing that they

393
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,519
do last on the scene

394
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,879
they can last one seed longer but

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,720
generally the the greatest limit here is

396
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,600
48 hours

397
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
there are some products older products

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
sometimes or other formulations that

399
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,159
you'll see are not recommended at all

400
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,560
for whatever reason they were not

401
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,679
compatible with the

402
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,198
inoculum product and so those are ones

403
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,759
that you really need to

404
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,078
to look at and watch out for and maybe

405
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,480
choose a different inoculant that was

406
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,559
more compatible with the product that

407
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,600
you want to apply

408
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,078
or potentially choose a different c

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
treatment

410
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:04,638
product like i said we do do

411
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,320
testing you know we offer our products

412
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
for testing so these are products that

413
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
aren't on the list or on on the guide

414
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,639
yet so these are new

415
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,440
syngenta products that have been

416
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,399
recently commercialized and we've done

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,560
testing with those and you can see that

418
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,198
they're also 48 hours

419
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,958
for the simultaneous sequential and tank

420
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:29,198
mixed

421
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:31,838
timings application timings and

422
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,319
if you don't see one of the products on

423
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
the

424
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,440
application guide from the inoculant

425
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,919
company the

426
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
manufacturer of the seed treatment may

427
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,159
have this information

428
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,479
with them and we do put this information

429
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,159
in our technical bulletins and technical

430
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,159
presentations so it

431
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,480
it is available because we know that

432
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,480
those guides aren't updated all the time

433
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,039
so how do we avoid problems with the

434
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,958
seed treatment and inoculants

435
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,319
we want to avoid using products with

436
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,638
negative effects of course

437
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
when the formulation process we're

438
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,879
trying to use the

439
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
products that would be trying to avoid

440
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,439
the ones that are really

441
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,719
negative and there's always the acute

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
toxicity

443
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,040
the exposure dose and the length of the

444
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,879
exposure and if you see this uh

445
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:24,559
lady girl sitting here this is a

446
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,399
famous painting from the from 1800s

447
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,719
and there's a really nice green

448
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,440
wallpaper in the background

449
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,879
and she's lucky that she has the window

450
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
open here because

451
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,320
this green wallpaper in the victorian

452
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,679
areas was

453
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
color was due to arsenic and they used

454
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,278
arsenic to make that green color in the

455
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:47,120
wallpaper and they had a lot of problems

456
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,519
with people actually getting sick

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,198
when in the winter was closed up and

458
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,278
they would be in here and

459
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,240
actually get sick from the arsenic in

460
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,559
the in the wallpaper that was coming out

461
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,159
so if she had she's lucky she had the

462
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,359
window open if she'd been outside or

463
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,720
away from that

464
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,679
she could have avoided it or taken down

465
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,880
the wallpaper

466
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,160
eliminated that then you're able to

467
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,959
not be exposed to that toxic

468
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,400
toxicity so in

469
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,279
similarly for to test compatibility

470
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,839
we have different ways we can apply the

471
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,240
the

472
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,798
inoculum or the the bio control agent

473
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,679
you can do a simultaneous application

474
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,879
a sequential application or a tank mix

475
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
application

476
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
tank mix application is kind of like

477
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
being right in the room with with the

478
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,080
product

479
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,079
this is uh a diagram that i got from a

480
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,798
bsf

481
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,359
document from canada and it shows very

482
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,440
nicely what a sequential application is

483
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,479
where the seed treatment must be applied

484
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,200
and allowed to dry

485
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
before the inoculant is applied the

486
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
simultaneous

487
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,279
application the seed treatment can be

488
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
applied

489
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,558
at the same time as the inoculant but

490
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,880
separate applicators must be used

491
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,798
and then the tank mix application

492
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
basically the inoculant is mixed

493
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,079
directly with the

494
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,678
diluted seed treatment and applied as

495
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,558
one solution

496
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,200
however they do recommend that the

497
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,240
maximum

498
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,160
hours of the slurry that's mixed up in

499
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
it you have to be applied within six

500
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,519
hours

501
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,640
and some other uh people recommend

502
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,639
within four hours

503
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:38,558
there is also a best practices guide so

504
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
novazyme says produced a bio egg best

505
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,599
practices

506
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,480
guide for using inoculants and it has a

507
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,519
lot of really good information around

508
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,839
how to keep these organisms

509
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,359
working and compatibility with seed

510
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,399
treatments

511
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,199
for living organisms you know that they

512
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,798
depend

513
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,759
on us as applicators to

514
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,558
exerg exercise good storage practices

515
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,240
before and after the application

516
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,678
you want to make sure that there's cool

517
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
temperatures that favor

518
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,440
the survival of the bacteria found in

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the inoculants

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
store the products and seed to which the

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,119
products have been applied in a cool dry

522
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,879
place

523
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,798
and refer to the conditions

524
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
on the product and seed labels for

525
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,079
specific recommendations

526
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,839
on how to best keep those organisms

527
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,119
happy

528
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,038
the other thing is you can have a

529
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,839
dedicated tank

530
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:39,200
and for the inoculum and a pumping

531
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,879
system this will allow for easy

532
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,319
management of the inocument or

533
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
biological products

534
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,599
and while the standard seed treatments

535
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
are generally stable

536
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,359
if left in a mixed tank for a few days

537
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,640
before consumed it's not true for

538
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,359
inoculants

539
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,919
a dedicated tank would allow you to open

540
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,879
and mix

541
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,600
only what you need for immediate use and

542
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
keeping your

543
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,918
inoculant source as fresh and as viable

544
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,279
as possible

545
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,080
and even with the dedicated tank need to

546
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,038
apply all

547
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,000
of the product within 24 hours after

548
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,919
opening

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,279
and if you don't have a dedicated tank

550
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
you can

551
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,720
choose to mix the inoculants with the

552
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,919
treatment but if this

553
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,480
is done that like i said you need to be

554
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,159
using all of that slurry with up within

555
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
four to six hours

556
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
and another important thing is to clean

557
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,679
out your equipment

558
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,798
and make sure that you have good

559
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,159
sanitation throughout so that the

560
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,440
sea treatment and the and the inoculant

561
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,240
that you use in the next

562
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,798
next batch are also compatible or make

563
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,960
sure things are clean

564
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,279
another thing that a lot of people don't

565
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,079
really think about is the water

566
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:55,759
so you may be treating with a city water

567
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,079
and as we know they treat city water

568
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,480
with

569
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
with chlorine to help kill microbes in

570
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,919
the water so

571
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,360
this is not going to be compatible with

572
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,600
your inoculum

573
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,839
and so if you're treating with the city

574
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,798
water which has chlorine added

575
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,798
you may want to install a water filter

576
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,679
which is designed to remove the

577
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,240
chlorine or use a spare tank where you

578
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,480
can

579
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,359
hold the water for 24 hours and allow

580
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,200
the chlorine to dissipate before you

581
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,519
use it in your slurry also many treaters

582
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
use

583
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,759
soybean oil to help or other oils to

584
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,240
help

585
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,720
with the treatment process and generally

586
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,640
this has been shown not to be an issue

587
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,000
and doesn't seem to have any effect or

588
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
harm on the

589
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
on the bacteria and it also may even

590
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,798
improve the

591
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
quality a little bit because it dries a

592
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,158
little bit slower than just

593
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,480
straight water it's also other

594
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
important to check all of the other

595
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,200
things that you're adding to the

596
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,120
the mixture the slurry in in addition to

597
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,759
the seed treatment part you can add

598
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,798
other polymers or colors or maybe

599
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,798
another product

600
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,319
uh from somewhere and you want to make

601
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:12,319
sure you check all of those when you're

602
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:14,879
applying it with a with an inoculant

603
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,639
so important to think about all of the

604
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
things that are going into your slurry

605
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,640
i've talked a lot about the inoculants i

606
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,519
talked about the

607
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,600
seed treatments and now another growing

608
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,639
area is really a biological

609
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,678
so a lot of these biologicals could be

610
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,799
living organisms as well what are really

611
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,919
growers looking for

612
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,158
for a biological we're trying to unlock

613
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,360
soil-bound nutrients we're trying

614
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,840
to enhance access to those nutrients fix

615
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,079
atmospheric nitrogen stimulate

616
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,199
development or protect

617
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:56,399
against pathogens so

618
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,798
and some of these can be live organisms

619
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
or

620
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:04,000
plant extracts small peptides

621
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,558
all kinds of things that you want to

622
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,119
make sure

623
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,519
those are the integrity of those is

624
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,839
maintained when you're mixing them

625
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,879
for bio control usually these can be it

626
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,158
could be viruses

627
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,600
bacterial fungal pathogens pheromones or

628
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,200
botanicals or other substances

629
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,158
in biostimulants you could have

630
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,919
microbial products

631
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,120
nitrogen fixing bacteria algal extracts

632
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,240
humic acids amino acids peptides enzymes

633
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,839
vitamins

634
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,480
all kinds of things nutrients are

635
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,839
usually

636
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,360
micro or macro nutrients that generally

637
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,319
are not

638
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,959
considered incompatible with seed

639
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,839
treatments

640
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,120
in a living sense but could be

641
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:53,038
incompatible

642
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:57,278
from a physical chemistry type of sense

643
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:59,278
so if the biological or the organism is

644
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,278
actually a living organism

645
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,359
the same kind of rules would apply as

646
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,079
we've talked about for the rhizobium

647
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,240
bacteria

648
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,839
you want to make sure that those are

649
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,120
happy and those conditions for that

650
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,639
organism

651
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,918
are satisfied and want to test and make

652
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
sure that those

653
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,600
bacteria are still alive on the on the

654
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,639
seed after

655
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,719
after application that it's compatible

656
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
and the testing for this compatibility

657
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,319
is done by a lot of the biological

658
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
companies that are bringing these new

659
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,879
products to the market

660
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,720
we're often approached by companies that

661
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,480
ask for product to test

662
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
when they're starting out trying to

663
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
determine if they can

664
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,440
apply a product to the seed and if that

665
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,200
would be a mechanism

666
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
of delivery for their product or

667
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,759
potentially they would have to go in

668
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,000
furrow

669
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,919
and do a application that way instead of

670
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,038
applying it with the seed treatment

671
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,038
they're also trying to figure out

672
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,919
whether they can do the tank mix or it

673
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,960
would be built

674
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,640
it could be built into a formulation a c

675
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,558
treatment formulation

676
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,799
or if it's better doing a sequential

677
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,678
application something like that

678
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,639
and so this there's a lot of work that's

679
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,640
been done in this

680
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,159
this area but if you're not sure about

681
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,720
the products you're using

682
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,080
or if they've been tested it's always

683
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
good to ask

684
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,519
you know ask the manufacturer what what

685
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,079
the compatibility is

686
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,918
and what kind of testing's been done we

687
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,000
do syngenta

688
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,038
doesn't do a lot of compatibility

689
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,599
testing

690
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,440
of all the products the biological

691
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,000
products on the market unless we have an

692
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,919
agreement

693
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
with that company that we're interested

694
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,759
in they're biological

695
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
or they've asked us to test it or

696
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,200
have to supply some product for them to

697
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,240
test but there is

698
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,600
testing going on

699
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,558
so i did mention uh you know just

700
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,839
a lot about the biologicals that were

701
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,678
thinking about

702
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,879
and how they're compatible trying to

703
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,600
keep them alive

704
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
but there's also physical compatibility

705
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,000
and some of these other products that i

706
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,278
mentioned

707
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
uh humic acids the

708
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,599
they're not they're not living but

709
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,720
they're products that are being applied

710
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,000
on the seed as biological and

711
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,679
it's important to look at the

712
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,519
compatibility of those if you're going

713
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,600
to apply those at the same time or put

714
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,400
them into your slurry

715
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,678
and one of the best ways to do that is

716
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,679
to do a jar test

717
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
and you can learn a lot from a jar test

718
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,320
that'll save you a lot of trouble

719
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
cleaning out lines and tanks and

720
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:30,798
cleaning up the mess later

721
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,278
we do tests with our products with

722
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,038
biologicals that we are thinking about

723
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,640
or we know that may be

724
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,558
put into a into a tank mix

725
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,840
and one of the things we're looking for

726
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,240
is the incompatibility just physical

727
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,480
incompatibility

728
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,359
uh change in viscosity change in

729
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,798
appearance or

730
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,719
physical behavior or separation like you

731
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,679
can see here in this

732
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
this jar and that's something you want

733
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,240
to try

734
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,720
to avoid sometimes there's a little bit

735
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,359
of separation but if it's recirculated

736
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,919
easily

737
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,959
then we usually say that that would be

738
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,120
acceptable

739
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
and there's also compatibilities where

740
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,759
we increase the temperature

741
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,558
decrease the temperature make sure that

742
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,879
in a range of temperatures it's okay

743
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,798
so there's a lot of tests that are done

744
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,278
with just physical compatibility

745
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,278
also it's very important to clean the

746
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,240
equipment when changing formulation

747
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,278
types

748
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,399
just a good cleanliness really helps out

749
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,960
with

750
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,079
seed treating and making sure that

751
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,960
everything is is

752
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,678
compatible and flowing easily and

753
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,079
another

754
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,679
one way to clean out easily is using a

755
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,678
simple green something like that

756
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,720
so i did go through quickly quite a lot

757
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,919
of

758
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,360
information and i just wanted to

759
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,960
talk a little bit about some of the

760
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,918
sources of the information i have

761
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,240
there's the bio

762
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,000
nova zones bio ag c treatment

763
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,159
compatibility guide

764
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,558
this i did take some information from

765
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,520
the 2013 one but there is another one

766
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,839
that

767
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,759
was updated more recently and there's a

768
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,199
best practices guide that's available

769
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,480
online

770
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,759
from this january there was some

771
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,240
information you can find

772
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,278
from compatibility of different

773
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,798
inoculants from

774
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,038
from bsf in canada there's a

775
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,200
syngenta technical bulletins or

776
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,398
technical bulletins from your company

777
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,480
or other c treatment companies about

778
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,038
the inoculum compatibility or biological

779
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,519
compatibilities

780
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,200
and then there's different papers that

781
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,558
you can read about online

782
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,640
quite a lot of journal articles and

783
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,839
other information that you can you can

784
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,799
go to to

785
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,278
really dig into some of this as well so

786
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,278
if

787
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,720
with that if if there's any time left

788
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,798
i'd like to

789
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,960
you know get take some questions

790
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,079
david thank you very much for the for

791
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,519
the talk yes just

792
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,519
a a question or so it's again packing a

793
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,278
lot of information in a short amount of

794
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,639
time

795
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:15,359
and again yes also again the cca credits

796
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,600
there's your information to go ahead and

797
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,240
get those cca credits

798
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,678
so a question for david on compatibility

799
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,120
of the seed treatment

800
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,840
chemical seed treatments with the

801
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:29,439
rhizobia or the bio controls

802
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,678
okay and i don't see anything in the

803
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,519
chat right now okay

804
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,798
david again thank you very much thank

805
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,480
you very much for this great

806
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:41,839
presentation

807
