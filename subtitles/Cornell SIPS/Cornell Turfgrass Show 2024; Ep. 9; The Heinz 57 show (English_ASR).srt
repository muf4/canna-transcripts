1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,160
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,039
University I actually thought this was

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,559
really cool from a sort of I see people

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,480
investing a lot of money uh in dealing

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,079
with algae uh and and and weed

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,519
management vegetation management which

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,479
sort of starts with algal developments

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,759
in many ways right shading things out

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,160
and lot causing other issues um so the

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,480
use of barley straw is pretty common now

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,480
uh I know this was pioneered man many

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,840
years ago rockas swad did this work in

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,238
his younger years uh in Nebraska it

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,079
looks like when the water temperature

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,640
gets to about 55 degrees uh you put this

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
barley straw right at the inlet uh there

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,520
are chemicals that are eluded from the

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,000
straw I honestly haven't looked at the

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,320
science of this at all but I do know it

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is pretty widely used and you know when

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,960
you consider what's involved in putting

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,960
one of those you know for lack of a

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,518
better term wedding venue fountains in

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,719
the mid middle of a golf course it more

25
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,400
guys are going to the bubblers that are

26
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,799
a little uh better I know there's lots

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,118
of solutions but this is a pretty simple

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
one that even gets used at a Swanky

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,159
place like Jim's got there at Fairview

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,759
Carl always thinking about fun things

31
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,280
around golf courses uh uh and really

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,519
love this sign I got to play a couple of

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,239
weeks ago and and I gotta tell you when

34
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,719
you play in a scramble and you're a

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,879
lousy golfer it gives you all these

36
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,879
feelings because you don't have to sweat

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,560
your crappy shots in fact as soon as you

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,798
hit a crappy shot you're happy to

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,719
support the other crappy golfer you're

40
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,759
playing with who might on the off chance

41
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,840
hit a good shot and I think when you

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,640
approach around a golf like that you

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
know I think it tends to be uh just a

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,718
little bit more fun and I and I think

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,560
we've talked about in previous episodes

46
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:51,839
uh the fun coming out of golf but I just

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,159
had this real uh thing about dogs and

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
wet dogs and dogs that are out in the

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,960
rain right so you know people want to

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,239
know why their cars smell like wet sappy

51
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,399
dogs I'm sure you know what this is Carl

52
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,599
and also uh Tim gra out in Iowa you know

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,520
everybody's in for rain and I want to go

54
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,318
out and I give you that look like what

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,080
are we doing here get me out of this

56
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,399
place and dogs have a way of

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,680
communicating those uh feelings just by

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,039
their looks so Carl you had something to

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,439
say about something I mentioned uh last

60
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,280
week on the show uh I actually thought

61
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,519
is pretty cool so why don't you take us

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,919
through this Urban nutrient management

63
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,480
stuff we've worked on yeah so wanted to

64
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,399
talk a little bit about backstory uh of

65
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,959
how this document came to be and and

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,840
sort of continue on from some of our

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
thoughts last week which is about you

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,120
know we talked about uh fertilization

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,680
soil test mlsn and and then we we

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,800
mentioned this Urban nutrient management

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,280
plan which sort of codifies some best

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,319
practices around um how we we use that

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
fertilizer uh and really what it comes

74
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:57,039
back to is is not so much turf grass

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,759
quality but water quality uh and that a

76
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,598
lot of these documents and best banag

77
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,280
practices are connected to to reducing

78
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,719
the amount of nutrients and sediment

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,919
that's getting into the water and

80
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,318
causing issues so uh one of the guests

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,598
this week we were trying to get was Mike

82
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,119
goatley and and I you know I read one of

83
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,439
his papers he was involved in which

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,439
talks about the history of of turf grass

85
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,158
nutrient management as it pertains uh to

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,878
the Chesapeake Bay Watershed and how the

87
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,840
regulatory environment has shaped um

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,798
sort of how we use turf grass

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,719
fertilizers in this Watershed uh and

90
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,200
this comes back to water quality right

91
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,680
so the the picture that people can see

92
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,318
on the screen

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,000
uh from this Watershed which is really

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,919
big stretches across Six States uh you

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,759
can see a lot of red on that image red

96
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,958
means there's not a lot of oxygen in the

97
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,959
water and that's because these nutrients

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,438
are are basically powering organisms

99
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,799
that are sucking up all the oxygen and

100
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,318
there's nothing left for the the plants

101
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,719
and animal life that are needed to

102
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,878
thrive in those situations so we know

103
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,560
that that nutrients are concern here how

104
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,078
do we fix this right what can we do uh

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,479
the sort of standard approach from an

106
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,640
environmental engineering perspective is

107
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,238
to V A A tmdl some folks may have heard

108
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,479
this before it stands for total maximum

109
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,280
daily load and and it's essentially a

110
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,959
process that um you go through to to

111
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,919
clean up water so first okay you

112
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,079
identify a problem and then you got to

113
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,879
figure out okay how much you how many

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,000
pollutants are getting into this water

115
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,279
body how do we quantify the amount of

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,800
nitrogen or phosphorus or sediment

117
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,638
that's getting in there and we need to

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,960
do a lot of assuming and we need to run

119
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,079
this through a bunch of models right

120
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,680
there's a lot of land in this this

121
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,079
watershed there's a there's a lot of

122
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,879
equations that go into that uh but they

123
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,120
try and make their best estimate then

124
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,959
they got to figure out okay how much do

125
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,360
we have to reduce that pollutant load so

126
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,319
that we get clean water um so they

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,319
develop those targets that's the tmdl

128
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,399
sort of targets actual numbers we have

129
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,519
to hit uh and then we got to figure out

130
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,839
ways to hit those best management

131
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,000
practices so that's where these sort of

132
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,159
plans come in hopefully you do that and

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,439
eventually the water gets clean so the

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,320
numbers for Chesapeake Bay Watershed are

135
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,879
are this uh 84.3 million kilog of

136
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,360
nitrogen we don't want any more than

137
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:08,759
that per year uh 5.7 million kilog of

138
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,319
phosphorus uh and 2.9 billion kilograms

139
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,120
of sediment so we don't want to exceed

140
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,839
those levels um and then we got to hit

141
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,160
those targets by 2025 so those are like

142
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,879
really big numbers again sort of

143
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,240
abstract like where do we get those and

144
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,918
that comes back to this modeling

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,319
component where there's a lot of

146
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:28,639
assumptions right we've got a

147
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,280
contributing we've got turf grass right

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,360
that's we're going to talk about there's

149
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,679
natural sort of secretion of of

150
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,919
nutrients that just sort of get out of

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
the water uh and one of the assumptions

152
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,799
we learned a couple years ago in a call

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,560
Frank with some folks in the New York

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,000
State DEC was that they assume every

155
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,720
piece of of turf grass in this Watershed

156
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,879
is

157
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,360
fertilized uh and we were sort of like

158
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,199
oh boy that's that's a red flag right

159
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,600
that's probably not a good assumption uh

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
and it was too late for us to sort of

161
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,759
change that assumption in the model but

162
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,199
we did sort of look up some numbers and

163
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
you know how much do do homeowners

164
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,080
fertilize maybe that's a good proxy

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,439
seems like 40 to 60% there's not great

166
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,318
data on that it probably is regional

167
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,959
it's probably breaking down by rural

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,720
suburban Urban there's probably

169
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,239
different amounts fertilizer fertilizer

170
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,560
uh going on there but but the bottom

171
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,519
line is that Assumption of 100% is is

172
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,160
wrong right that's not good um but

173
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,038
there's there's a famous quote from a

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,599
British statistician uh George box uh

175
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,639
and it says all models are wrong uh but

176
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,478
some are useful right so for us in turf

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,199
grass we get really defensive and and

178
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,800
you know part of those assumptions being

179
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,120
100% of turf is fertilized lead to hey

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,439
we got to do a lot of these best

181
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,199
practices to reduce our fertilizer and a

182
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,918
lot of times there's a regulatory aspect

183
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,000
to that you know we have phosphorus laws

184
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,399
across all these states there's uh

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,598
nitrogen sort of caps in some states um

186
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,120
but I think what it's accomplished is is

187
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,959
probably still pretty useful and part of

188
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,038
the accomplishment is codifying these

189
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,079
best management practices right uh there

190
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,800
is an expert Turf panel in the chesap

191
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,719
bay and they come up with these 10 core

192
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,280
uh practices that if if we do these

193
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,759
things we can you know estimate that we

194
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,918
reduce nitrogen leaking out of tur Turf

195
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,960
systems phosphorus leaking out uh and

196
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:16,240
the first one is how we came into

197
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,439
developing this Urban nutrient

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,918
management plan and it says basically

199
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,719
develop an urban nutrient management

200
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,959
plan for the property based on a soil

201
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
test and that's why we talk about mlsn

202
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,519
last week we talk about you know we

203
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,599
should probably use less fertilizer uh

204
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:34,478
having that plan codifying that uh helps

205
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,639
reduce the the excess fertilizer now two

206
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:36,878
of the other ones I think are really

207
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,478
important have nothing to do with

208
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,560
fertilizer but they sort of have

209
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,439
everything to do with what Turf does uh

210
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,759
in in sort of our Landscapes and how it

211
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,639
pertains to water quality uh the second

212
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,319
one is maintain a dense vegetation cover

213
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,400
of turf grass that reduces erosion uh it

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,158
reduces runoff and retains nutrients so

215
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,158
that is saying you know there's a reason

216
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,399
we have a lot of grass uh and it's

217
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,038
because it slows the water down or let's

218
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,359
slow that water down reduce errosion and

219
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,038
the turf grass is good at using

220
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,598
nutrients let's let all the nutrients

221
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,000
that are in that water seep into the

222
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,878
grass and the grass can use them and and

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,439
it takes it out of the water uh the

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,879
other thing uh that they mentioned one

225
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,319
of the bmps is make sure that your soil

226
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,120
in in turf grass systems has good

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,400
paracity and infiltration right so

228
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,639
that's sort of a reason if you have

229
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,079
compacted areas Especial where waterers

230
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,038
sort of on a steep slope it's going

231
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,279
really fast again we want that water to

232
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,199
go in and not across uh and again that

233
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,559
reduces our pollutant loads into the

234
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,399
into the chest Bay and these are good

235
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,360
things this is why we have grass and why

236
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,918
we have a lot of grass is because it

237
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,918
functions in these environments so part

238
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,759
of the bmps is like make sure you have

239
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,478
all grass and not bare area so that's a

240
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,039
good thing from from a turf management

241
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,560
perspective so so Carl listen and let's

242
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,360
let's go through a couple of things

243
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,359
right because each one of these things

244
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,240
uh has its own story to it let's start

245
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,800
out with soil testing right um we've

246
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,278
actually been as you mentioned last week

247
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:03,278
uh not necessarily support of soil

248
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,240
testing uh if it's interpreted in a way

249
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,000
we think is not consistent in fact we

250
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,639
even made the Asian turf grass programs

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
uh shout out this week from Micah Woods

252
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,120
uh commenting on our conversation uh

253
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,160
from last week that you that you led

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,519
right so so it isn't that you're soil

255
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,399
testing right that's not really the

256
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,600
issue it's the way you're interpreting

257
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,440
the numbers that you're getting and the

258
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,278
way you're calibrating those soil

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
nutrients to your observations and the

260
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:32,559
and your Turf performance in a

261
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,360
measurable way could be growth could be

262
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,759
disease resistance it could be traffic

263
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,360
tolerance whatever whatever that is okay

264
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,838
so that's the first thing the second

265
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,159
thing I want to say is I remember

266
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,880
driving by the golf course with the sort

267
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,719
of this environmental engineer was

268
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,838
visiting us one time and and you know we

269
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,040
just driving like we always do out to

270
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
from the campus which is very Urban out

271
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,399
to the turf plots and where the golf

272
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,759
course is and which is very you know

273
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,958
Suburban on the edge of suburban and

274
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,200
Rural uh and and first thing the

275
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,199
engineer says man it's so great this is

276
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,680
like a sponge for all this water you

277
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,440
know I don't know he actually says I

278
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,439
don't know why anybody gives golf

279
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,279
courses a hard time they're like perfect

280
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,600
for the storm water management needs so

281
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,600
some of it is Carl we don't always look

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
at things the way other people look at

283
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,079
them and what that's what you just

284
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,199
demonstrated in your point there the

285
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,719
engineers well it's grass it must be

286
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,519
fertilized in some ways now we do know

287
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,839
back to this point when you got a lot of

288
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,240
organic matter

289
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,279
and you got active soil life you are

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,399
releasing nutrients right but

291
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,480
theoretically one would hope that

292
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,839
wouldn't exceed what a plant and a

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,399
system could take up in a rizosphere but

294
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,200
there are times when just organic matter

295
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,200
levels build up and can leak and and

296
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,399
there could be just natural releases of

297
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,000
nitrogen now the last Point here I

298
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,799
actually got a picture uh to talk about

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
things we don't think about where I'm

300
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,639
going to talk about sports Fields a

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
little bit today Carl we the

302
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,360
intersection of these ecosystem services

303
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,439
and the functional use of this landscape

304
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,600
is very dramatic on these Sports fields

305
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,959
and I'll just ask you again to remind me

306
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,360
you read a paper or uh talked to us

307
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:17,559
about a paper that showed uh compacted

308
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,039
Sports fields are getting on the radar

309
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,479
of storm water management Engineers to

310
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,360
your Chesapeake pay point now this isn't

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,720
a chemical property car we're talking

312
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,079
about so physical properties which is

313
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
what your last core management thing was

314
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,759
there

315
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,279
uh can you talk a little bit about you

316
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,278
know what we mean when we say compacted

317
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,480
surface obviously there's no grass here

318
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,078
so that's not good but also the

319
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,039
compacted soils on these fields create

320
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,278
uh runoff problems as well yeah so uh

321
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,919
you know we talk a little bit about the

322
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,480
modeling that goes into figuring out

323
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,599
okay what pollutant loads getting into

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
the water um there was a thesis at a

325
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,720
temple and and they do a lot of

326
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,559
monitoring of okay when we have a rain

327
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
event how much water comes off of this

328
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,799
land and this Watershed and how fast

329
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
does it come off and you can do some

330
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,519
calculations based on the land use so if

331
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,799
you have a sports field that's sort of a

332
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,078
natural you know lawn turf grass

333
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,958
environment that's different from uh you

334
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,359
know a developed housing area that has a

335
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,719
lot of impermeable surface it's

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,680
different from a forest and they have

337
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
some estimates on how much water should

338
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,519
come off so they do those estimates and

339
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,879
then they're collecting data on how much

340
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,159
water is actually coming off and they're

341
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,679
like hm there's more water coming off

342
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,879
than we thought and it's coming off

343
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,319
faster than we thought and you know why

344
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,000
is it what assumptions are we getting

345
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,600
wrong and what they're sort of pointing

346
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,198
to is like know there's all these

347
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,720
athletic fields and we're assuming an

348
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,919
infiltration rate of X and it's coming

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,560
off faster than that and so what they're

350
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,838
figuring out is that if these these uh

351
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,439
athletic fields are compacted that that

352
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,519
water's not going in like it's supposed

353
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
to be and it's overloading there's

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,198
there's there's more water than they are

355
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,639
expecting coming off of this Watershed

356
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,359
and that affects how they design green

357
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,759
infrastructure water control structures

358
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,759
at the at the the outlet point so uh

359
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,198
they were sort of pointing to like hm

360
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,720
like that's maybe something we have to

361
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,240
consider either changing in our model or

362
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
it would be great if we manage these

363
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,198
Sports fields to have a certain amount

364
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,720
of infiltration and collect that water

365
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,359
like we think it should yeah all right

366
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,920
well since we're talking about the soil

367
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
let's start with soil temperature which

368
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,719
was surprisingly warm uh in the New York

369
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,320
metropolitan area well into the 60s

370
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,639
almost everywhere except the highest

371
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,120
elevations are pushing into the upper

372
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,879
50s but you've got temperatures well

373
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,879
into the 70s uh in the metropolitan New

374
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,360
York work area and this is a a pretty

375
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,519
big deal because you're now in the

376
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,680
throws of active growth active soil life

377
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,360
you want to make sure you've got your uh

378
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,439
summer patch sprays down your your soil

379
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,440
pathogen sprays uh because obviously the

380
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,920
infection period for these organisms is

381
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,680
well underway um it's been warmer right

382
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,559
uh the early part of last week uh before

383
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,479
it got cool most recently it was in the

384
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,159
40s today here in Upstate New York uh

385
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,920
but I can tell you uh War overall last

386
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,639
week uh a little more uh well above

387
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,958
normal last week uh and the interesting

388
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,720
thing is and this is I think and also a

389
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,638
very interesting point of discussion

390
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Carl because this was like the second

391
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,839
week where I've observed some drying in

392
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,839
my eye tests of traveling around uh the

393
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,920
area right uh and when you look at

394
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,920
precipitation minus uh you know evapo

395
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,759
transpiration you see again the sort of

396
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,399
localized nature of precipitation

397
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,720
and again when we're talking about

398
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,480
runoff we got pockets of three and four

399
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,320
Ines of rain being dumped in some of

400
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,159
these areas in Scranton along the cape

401
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,480
uh on the North End Northshore of Long

402
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,480
Island you know into the Hudson Valley

403
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,519
and then not 10 miles 20 miles away

404
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,800
you're at a inch or two inch deficit

405
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,159
right and so it looks like the drying is

406
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,039
going to

407
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,480
continue uh now uh looking at the lawn

408
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,278
water model Carl the the model is

409
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,759
picking up the drying that's occurring

410
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,320
it picked up the rain that went through

411
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,039
this is for Long Island uh this is uh

412
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,480
for the farming Dale location so Sandy

413
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,519
areas now still have plenty of water

414
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,639
don't need to irrigate uh we're

415
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,360
definitely I think uh honing in on the

416
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,759
drying the growth estimates are also

417
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,440
showing that growth is pretty active

418
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,839
particularly when you're not irrigating

419
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,759
so in some of these locations you better

420
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,959
check these things because these

421
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,639
localized models are going to end

422
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,239
indicate whether growth is going to be

423
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
higher or or below normal but this is

424
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,639
where it gets funny to me Carl we talked

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,199
about this earlier the foler models have

426
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,440
been very active much earlier I think

427
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,439
even even art mentioned this morning the

428
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:51,079
brown patch model was flaring up soils

429
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,600
are drying but the foliage is wet right

430
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:56,039
and you look at sort of where we are

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,278
today and where we're going to be by the

432
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,838
end of the week would you spray Carl

433
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,919
where where would you if you're at the

434
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,880
end of a spray would you spray or would

435
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,919
you hold tell me where you where where

436
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,600
what you're thinking you got dry soils

437
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,719
you know you've got to maybe add some

438
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,639
water talk to me a little bit about

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,199
management decisions with your water

440
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,399
model your growth model and your disease

441
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,838
models all integrated together they're

442
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,958
all wrong right they're all wrong right

443
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
but they're all useful yeah I I think uh

444
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,318
the one thing with the dollar spot

445
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,799
models and we we talked about this a bit

446
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,679
last week is it spiked up uh and it

447
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,318
should be coming down now so if you were

448
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,159
to run the prediction on that to like

449
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,240
June 2 or something I think more of the

450
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,198
region is going to be in green uh we're

451
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,600
going to have these cool nights right so

452
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,078
from that perspective I think uh I would

453
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,879
hold off again and this is the the

454
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,039
perspective of like you know I'm a

455
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,240
course that has you know let's say five

456
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,439
I've accounted for five fungicide sprays

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,000
on my Fairways for the year and I

458
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,560
probably had to go out two weeks ago

459
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,679
when it sort of spiked up there and it

460
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,078
got really hot and humid so I've got

461
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,838
four left and I've got June July August

462
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,798
and we know the fall pressure has been

463
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,918
getting that's what I'm talking about we

464
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,918
we've been saving right we've been

465
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,759
saving these applications in the spring

466
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,799
because the whole thing shifted to the

467
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,558
fall yep so so I would save and the nice

468
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,160
part is that that growth potential is

469
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,399
going up we're getting into sort of

470
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Ideal temperatures if you have the

471
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,759
ability to irrigate right and you have

472
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,400
soil moisture and it's not limiting

473
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,919
growth uh even if I got a little bit I

474
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,038
would expect uh the the turf to grow out

475
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,720
of it so if I'm thinking large areas

476
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,079
Fairways and I've got limited sprays I'm

477
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,640
I'm definitely holding off and I'm even

478
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,399
looking at the Smith Kerns model and

479
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
it's interesting it's very low the next

480
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,160
couple days because it doesn't look at

481
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
the leaf wetness like we rely on Leaf

482
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,798
wetness which considers ah did it rain a

483
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
little bit is there a lot of relative

484
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,319
humidity the Smith curs is only relative

485
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,519
humidity um so if I look at both of

486
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,279
those models and I sort of s centralize

487
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,319
the recommendations I'd say yeah I I I

488
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,359
would definitely hold off on Fairways if

489
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,399
if I had a limited amount yeah okay now

490
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,918
listen my phone's been ringing off the

491
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,480
hook about natural and Synthetic Turf

492
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,559
and one of the things that keeps coming

493
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,599
up is there's not transparency uh

494
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,359
between the governance and stewardship

495
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,599
of sports Fields Carl and you know we're

496
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,158
going to be talking about this a lot

497
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,719
over the next few years we just got a

498
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,640
grant to do some work in this area in

499
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,839
school grounds and I want to use the

500
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,919
example of some of the things we've

501
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,879
learned here at Cornell uh has a way of

502
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,440
uh helping people in the grounds area

503
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,919
the sports turf area especially uh and

504
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,279
maybe golf guys will have something to

505
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,919
learn here as well is how to

506
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,440
operationalize uh or or add some data to

507
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,480
their technical operation um this is a

508
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,798
story that started with me serving on a

509
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,558
governance board uh for our athletic

510
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,119
department I've been the chair I just

511
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,158
finished up my 17th year as the chair of

512
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,279
the faculty advisory committee and I am

513
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,799
now retired from this committee it has

514
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,279
been a long and and Story Journey that

515
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,519
included the renovation of the swim test

516
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,000
here at Cornell which fell under the

517
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,918
opes of this one of the things I was

518
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,558
responsible for doing every few years

519
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,440
was to give a presentation to the

520
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:14,038
faculty and one of the things the

521
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,880
faculty Senate was very interested in

522
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,759
listen the Cornell faculty Senate is the

523
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,320
largest collection of nerds in the world

524
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,319
it's it it's somewhere between a

525
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,399
nerdfest and the Roman senate you know

526
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,439
where we love to hear ourselves

527
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,038
pontificate so every once in a while

528
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,000
they invite a knucklehead like me to

529
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,839
come in and it and I always get a lot of

530
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,079
questions about concussion so I come

531
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,959
prepared to discuss our concussion

532
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,158
Management program let's face it you're

533
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,919
at a university your your brain is the

534
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,000
most active muscle in your body uh by

535
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,640
far at this place than every any other

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,599
muscle but our athletes have to be very

537
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,159
mindful of concussions right and this is

538
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,519
something that the NCAA has been all

539
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,559
over obviously this is something that

540
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,038
Sports in general has to pay attention

541
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,158
to and we have a collection of data that

542
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,480
over the years I've been presenting

543
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,720
looking at the various Sports you know

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,640
this is from 2013 through 2018 you can

545
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,279
see football in general is very high

546
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,120
men's ice hockey in some years could

547
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,879
have as much as football women's ice

548
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,000
hockey uh still gets a fair amount

549
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,880
lacrosse another sport we're fairly good

550
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,240
at can be above uh average many years

551
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,280
and even wrestling another sport we're

552
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
pretty darn good at trying to get all

553
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,399
those well-fed Western Pennsylvania boys

554
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,679
here here uh wrestling around so uh

555
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,120
obviously this is a significant concern

556
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,600
for governance right Carl when we talk

557
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,599
about governance versus stewardship and

558
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,519
of course the governance includes

559
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,959
playing the game different you know

560
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,599
maybe you're not going to have kickoffs

561
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,679
in high school anymore you know these

562
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,279
things that happen at the high levels

563
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,240
maybe impact us at a lower level but I

564
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,879
can tell you the game changed for us

565
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
here at Cornell when we hired the

566
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,159
assistant coach for the national

567
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,120
champion Stanford Soccer football soccer

568
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:05,120
team a number of years ago coach Smith

569
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,918
here he gets here he gets hired he walks

570
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,399
out on the natural grass field for the

571
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,759
first time and he says we can't play

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,240
soccer here I can't kick a ball in a

573
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:17,079
straight line and that led to uh

574
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,480
Investments of a fair amount of money uh

575
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,319
to get uh the fields up to shape and

576
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,440
what it did also is it thrust myself and

577
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,359
Carl and at the time my graduate student

578
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,120
Chris sitco who's now the director of

579
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:32,359
this whole operation with thrust us into

580
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,278
having to manage this work with the

581
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,678
coaches work with the the people that

582
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,880
were managing these fields work with the

583
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,519
players work with the maintenance staff

584
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,240
and they were all a bunch of disparate

585
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,519
groups that there was no centralized

586
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,519
Focus for the way this field was tended

587
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,038
to now the first thing that jumped out

588
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,440
at me and Carl you you probably heard me

589
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,558
say this is there's two kinds of coaches

590
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,798
when you're thinking about just

591
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,798
governance from a coaches perspective

592
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,158
you got two kinds of coaches you got a

593
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,278
coach who can say I want the ball to do

594
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,960
this I want to here's a a good picture

595
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,679
of a athlete deflecting the ball to the

596
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,278
side and then maybe advancing it and

597
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,679
there's that little bit of friction that

598
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,880
occurs there that some coaches will say

599
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,038
really I want it to behave this way

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,000
right good all right then we go figure

601
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,359
out how to do it then you got these

602
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,919
coaches oh you need to M lower you need

603
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,959
to roll more you need why don't you core

604
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,200
this field wait a minute stay in your

605
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,558
lane budddy you're the co coach we're

606
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,159
the grounds people I had to realize whoa

607
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,158
now I know why I'm an academic and why I

608
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,679
have so much respect for guys like Ben

609
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,960
Palmer and all you know Nicole Sherry

610
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,240
Dan Cunningham all these guys that are

611
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,960
managing fields on a regular basis

612
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,599
dealing with coaches so we became as you

613
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,000
might expected Carl you know very data

614
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,480
driven like if we're gonna if the coach

615
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,359
is going to tell us what he wants we're

616
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,519
going to have to use numbers in one way

617
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,798
shape or form to know how to make

618
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,359
adjustments in our maintenance program

619
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,038
that then results in measurable

620
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:07,000
differences in these devices be they for

621
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,000
hardness moisture traction ball roll

622
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,200
ball

623
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,159
bounce so we have two uh we have two uh

624
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,558
setups for our soccer fields our Burman

625
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:19,840
field was built in 1995 it's a beautiful

626
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,200
Sandy uh so uh engineered sand with

627
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,038
compost and soil in it it's about two

628
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,679
acres it was resided to Kentucky

629
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:31,919
Bluegrass in 2016 and is now being

630
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,320
renovated into a Ry grass surface

631
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,559
because the other operation that the

632
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,000
students uh practice on is an off-campus

633
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,960
location where they've got two practice

634
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,558
bills both for men and for women and

635
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,960
some training ground in between uh that

636
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,558
are primarily Ry grass annual Bluegrass

637
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
surfaces so one of the Testaments one of

638
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,079
the things that we've been able to do is

639
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,480
to use this data to make these two

640
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,038
different playing surfaces play the same

641
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,278
but the annual blue BL grass uh problem

642
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:05,519
has become so severe on the Burman field

643
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,440
uh that we've not been able to combat it

644
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,240
so we're going to be shifting more of it

645
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,840
over to Ry grass so one of the things I

646
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,720
want to say about this in general is I

647
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,480
believe cool seas and natural grass

648
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,480
fields are done best when there's a

649
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,038
Bluegrass base that provides you that

650
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,519
that stability for a cleat to dig in and

651
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:25,440
then whatever the hell you want to grow

652
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,918
on top of it if you want to intensely

653
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,679
seed Ry grass if you want to put more

654
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
tall Fescue on it I don't really care I

655
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,798
worry a little bit more with t Fescue

656
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,720
that it can get Bunch type but as you

657
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,278
heard from Cal Bigalow a couple of weeks

658
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,798
ago we can actually do T Fescue pretty

659
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:44,119
low well when we started this operation

660
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,038
with them it wasn't looking good we were

661
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,719
having all kinds of problems with

662
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:51,119
irrigation we started top dressing we

663
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
needed to raise the sprinkler heads we

664
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,959
had a lot of infrastructural things so

665
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,038
the first thing I'm going to tell

666
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,640
anybody if they're talking to me about

667
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,480
natural versus synthetic is do you know

668
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
what you're doing do you have an

669
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,278
infrastructure that can actually support

670
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,159
the goals that you're trying to achieve

671
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,720
and so what we did and Carl I believe

672
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,640
you and Chris LED this effort years ago

673
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,319
is we basically said okay the people

674
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,159
we're talking to only understand numbers

675
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,960
yes they only they don't understand

676
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,720
anything about biology they probably

677
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,440
weren't that interested in engineering

678
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
but they might be interested they're

679
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,519
very much interested in the numbers so

680
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,759
you guys did a great job saying saying

681
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,000
okay how much do we do this for this for

682
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,599
that the other thing we started to look

683
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,759
at the various fields and the amount of

684
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,678
time we were spending on them with

685
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,398
floating time and this is where we learn

686
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,519
the concept of wrench time right car how

687
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,879
much time people spend actually doing

688
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,038
the job so we give them reports on hey

689
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,159
here's what we did so if you're in a

690
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,919
school district if you're at a

691
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,320
municipality just track your hours what

692
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,440
does it take you to do these things and

693
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,158
then start beginning to communicate

694
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,519
these things in a way that say here's

695
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,080
what this takes here's the over seating

696
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,679
that we had to do here's the weeklong

697
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,158
practices where we dominated by mowing

698
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,679
maybe we did another 13-week period

699
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,799
where we did more top dressing uh out

700
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,559
there right again just putting in the

701
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:20,918
hours over a 13-week period we started

702
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,918
to talk to them and give them reports

703
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,480
about the data that we were finding and

704
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,520
the things that mattered we started to

705
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,519
get them to use covers in the hight

706
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,359
trffic area is where they'd see results

707
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,720
so we had been able to create an

708
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,759
environment over the last well

709
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,000
essentially seven years till then we

710
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,398
hired Chris sitco back to run the whole

711
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,798
operation where we you know had a

712
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:47,519
methodically work through the governance

713
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,798
and different parties involved here and

714
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,200
then even when you do that Carl the NC

715
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,918
the senior day comes along and you're

716
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,720
calling me on a Saturday it's like Frank

717
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,640
they got senior day what would they're

718
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,880
calling me me that they don't know what

719
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,200
to do we didn't have a real plan in

720
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,600
place right for what to do we didn't

721
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,000
have a person really that oversaw it so

722
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,959
they were calling us and we said I don't

723
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,200
know get out there and test it we tested

724
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,200
it and said don't play on that field the

725
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,759
darn thing is frozen even when you take

726
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,360
the snow off they took the snow off and

727
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,079
played anyway so even when you give them

728
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,439
the data sometimes they're going to do

729
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:27,359
what they're going to do here's where

730
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,600
I'd wrap this up Carl I think any

731
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,918
operation that manages Sports Fields

732
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,798
golf courses or grounds should have

733
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
established protocols for the way they

734
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,558
go about their business right it

735
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,199
shouldn't be centered in just what a

736
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,158
superintendent knows or a foreman knows

737
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,519
or the people who work there for 15

738
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,480
years knows there should be things

739
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,798
written down to say this is how we

740
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,839
operate this place and then we have to

741
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,440
use that as a way of communicating our

742
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:57,000
needs externally right we keep following

743
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,759
up with people we hire good people and

744
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,398
you treat them right I me that's pretty

745
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,640
much what it comes down to when we talk

746
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,278
to people about natural versus synthetic

747
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,440
right we know that there are competing

748
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:11,038
priorities right they're competing

749
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,159
priorities for use how safe it is the

750
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,720
environmental costs the money and the

751
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,840
sociology which is there are egos

752
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,600
associated with getting certain kinds of

753
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:24,038
surfaces in communities there's the way

754
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,519
you fund these things is it a capital

755
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,440
expense or is it an ongoing expense

756
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,359
right a capital expense like a athetic

757
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,080
field you don't have to worry about

758
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,879
maintaining it so to speak and versus a

759
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,319
natural grass fields which is going to

760
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,320
have ongoing expenses which includes

761
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,278
maintenance differences that you can

762
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,879
learn more about at our Sports field

763
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,679
website here's the QR code for that and

764
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,760
you can go to our safe Sports field

765
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,720
website and get some information and

766
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,119
this will be renovated as part of our uh

767
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,360
granting program and also the best

768
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,239
management practices that are available

769
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,199
from a variety of States I know the New

770
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,278
England guys did really wonderful job

771
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,640
with this and so Carl that seems to be

772
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,558
it for me it'll just be me and you are

773
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,440
there any questions that came up or

774
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,678
comments you want to make um so we don't

775
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,000
have any questions but I think the

776
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,759
comment Frank is is uh you know when

777
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,798
you're trying to affect change of that

778
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,798
governance structure and tell them hey

779
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,720
we need x amount of people for X number

780
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:23,599
of labor hours we need this equipment or

781
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,200
remember we we talked about mowers and

782
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:29,278
replacing mower blades and it took you

783
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,038
right uh professor in in the College of

784
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,640
agon light it took a graduate student at

785
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,558
the time Chris and then me so three

786
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,200
people I didn't know I'm not sure I

787
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,519
entirely knew what I was doing but two

788
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
people who knew what they were doing and

789
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,640
me who was trying to put all the Excel

790
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,600
stuff together uh to really communicate

791
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,480
those needs over several years uh to

792
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,678
start to see that change and then uh

793
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,278
finally now Chris taking over and having

794
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,080
that sort of Baseline being able to

795
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,240
continuously communicate those now we're

796
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,158
going to have an inter you know an

797
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,798
undergrad student who's going to go out

798
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,039
and take this playability you know a

799
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,679
couple times a week to again sort of you

800
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,200
know figure out when when coach Smith

801
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,840
says hey I don't like how the dividing

802
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,319
it is or I don't like how the ball's

803
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,720
reacting we can have numbers that say oh

804
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,439
that's when we see the sheer test look

805
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,000
like this or the firmness test look like

806
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,558
this it's it's it's tough for one person

807
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,519
to affect all that change so in the past

808
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,639
I've said you got to hire somebody and

809
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,519
they need to know what they're doing but

810
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,038
that person also needs support in

811
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,640
communicating those numbers and

812
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,200
collecting some data um so it's just not

813
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,559
as simp simple as a k through2 District

814
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,558
hiring a person who knows what they're

815
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,119
doing they need to empower them to have

816
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,319
other people and train other people

817
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,759
around them and be able to communicate

818
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,038
and work with the governance structure

819
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,278
to say listen uh we can't meet your

820
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,679
expectations with this uh I need other

821
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,240
people to support me and that's how

822
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,480
we're gonna ultimately and yeah and just

823
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,679
to review Carl in 30 minutes we did

824
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,240
Urban nutrient management and soil

825
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
management right then we did dollar spot

826
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,720
and digital tool modeling how to use

827
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,079
those models to make decisions and then

828
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,798
we talked about managing Sports fields

829
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,439
in an operational way to get sort of uh

830
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,558
be able to sort of know what you're

831
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,120
doing and then communicate it to other

832
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,359
people around the various surfaces that

833
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,959
we manage I can't imagine you're gonna

834
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,599
get more in 30 minutes anywhere

835
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,278
else uh and one quick question Vitas was

836
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,439
asking about uh the data from shear and

837
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:31,000
compaction tools is that sort of a good

838
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,399
way to um get a holistic uh sort of look

839
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,919
at the performance I think so right I

840
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:36,599
mean I think firmness is is sort of

841
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,320
number one I would go to and then that

842
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,480
traction component is the next one I'd

843
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,359
go to any comments from you Frank on

844
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
additional tools or if those are sort of

845
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,678
what you would start with I I think the

846
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,278
ones we use there are pretty good but I

847
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,840
think you have to realize this they're

848
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,398
all indirect measurements of things yeah

849
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,119
right they're not direct measurements of

850
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,199
things that's why it is important to

851
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,798
calibrate them whatever device you're

852
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,240
using the reason I think used them there

853
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,119
there's already a data set that a lot of

854
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,599
different sporting organizations have

855
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,518
provided feedback on and I know Fe FIFA

856
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,719
is really you know uh elucidated these

857
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,880
things uh to to no end so there really

858
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,038
isn't any end to it but I'd say those

859
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,080
are two good places to start because

860
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,839
number one you don't want these kids

861
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,000
cracking their heads open when they hit

862
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,678
their head on the ground so I if they

863
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,759
crack their heads open banging into each

864
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,960
other that's a different animal but it's

865
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:28,759
not uh something that you definitely

866
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,240
want them doing and traction is

867
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,558
something it's good to know if the

868
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,679
turf's going to slip out from them which

869
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,398
is bad uh and also that the turf is too

870
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,639
stiff for them which is also bad so

871
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,038
there's that sweet spot in there I'd say

872
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:46,519
those are the two best ones if I added

873
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,720
anything I would probably add the ball

874
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,440
uh the ball roll and the ball bounce uh

875
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,038
because that also tends to be something

876
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,558
that the the uh players and coaches can

877
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:59,240
really associate their performance with

878
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,158
yeah so yeah that'll that'll wrap it us

879
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,079
for wrap it up for us today yeah a lot

880
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,760
of lot of ground covered today lot

881
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,879
ground Carl ground cover Turf there's a

882
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,398
covered the pitch as the Europeans would

883
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,399
say we fully covered the pitch covered

884
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,439
the pitch so thank you all for for those

885
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:17,798
attending live uh you guys will see us

886
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,440
next week uh with Ben mcgr take

887
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,319
care this has been a production of

888
