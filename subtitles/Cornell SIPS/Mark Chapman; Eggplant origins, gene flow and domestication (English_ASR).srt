1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,879
super all right thanks very much

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,678
margaret um it's really nice to be

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,000
invited

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm very much of appreciative um yes

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
it's about

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,320
5 45 here in the evening um so you guys

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
are just halfway through your day and

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,199
i'm just trying to

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,640
get away from my emails and everything

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
so this is actually a really nice thing

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
to be doing

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
um so as margaret said i'm at the

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
university of southampton i've been

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,359
there for

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,199
about nearly seven years now um

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,359
and today i'm going to talk about the

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
domestication work i've been doing

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,719
and this is looking primarily an

21
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,839
eggplant but we do have other projects

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
looking at brassicas and some other

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,600
things

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
so fingers crossed let me know if the

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,359
slides aren't changing or

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,359
my camera dies or anything margaret will

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,840
do a thumbs up or a thumbs down

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,119
um so this is my plan for the talk today

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
i'm going to talk about why

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,038
domestication is interesting why i

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,439
personally um get out of bed in the

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,439
morning and are super excited by this

33
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
and also why eggplant why would we want

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,280
to study this

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,359
species so i'm going to talk about the

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,920
demography of eggplant origins

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,118
which is about where it originated how

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,200
many times did was the crop domesticated

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,280
looking at gene expression divergence

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
this is using rna-seq in the last few

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,840
years

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
we've done some work looking at

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
selective sweeps in the genome

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
and we've been zooming in on one of

45
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,879
these traits as well

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,519
trying to get down to some candidate

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,599
genes involved in it

48
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,359
um just to quickly go through my the

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,039
three main collaborators that i've been

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,159
working with this isn't everyone

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
um but anna page she was a phd student

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,719
graduated about

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,719
a year ago from my lab jane gibson who

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,438
does some bioinformatics she largely

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,599
works on

56
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,359
human dna and things like that but she's

57
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,559
done a few clever tricks for me

58
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,959
with the bioinformatics and rachel who

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
um i was lucky enough to meet just after

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,478
she published some work on eggplant

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,360
and we struck up some ideas about what

62
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,359
to follow up with

63
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,639
so why would we study domestication and

64
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,919
why would we study

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,039
eggplants well domestication from a

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,839
a really is i think a really interesting

67
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,679
model to study evolution and it works

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,439
really well for a few reasons and these

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,800
are just some of the reasons i've

70
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,280
come up with so firstly um

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
we pretty much know what if we don't

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
know what the

73
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,839
uh progenitors are at least we can know

74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
that they will be extant

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
so we're not looking at speciation over

76
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,598
millions of years

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
where various species have been gone

78
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,679
extinct at any point

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
we largely know what trade traits were

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,439
involved so

81
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,839
um we can zoom in on these rather easily

82
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,400
it tends to be things like shattering

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,239
fruit shape fruit size taste colors

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
things like that um

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
it's recent and it's rapid so again we

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
haven't got millions of years

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
of evolution to try and decipher we've

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
just got a few thousand years

89
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,238
of very strong selection and in a lot of

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
cases we have parallel evolution so

91
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
um studying one crop you can often

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,439
piggyback off some of the

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
ideas from other crops potentially so

94
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,318
it's really interesting to study whether

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,598
parallel parallel evolution has occurred

96
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,598
but at the same time if crop a has

97
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,799
lost the ability to shatter its seeds

98
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,119
maybe crop b has

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
in the same genes so it's very quick to

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
zoom in on those

101
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,798
uh potential candidate genes um

102
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
of course there is the money side of

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,400
things so it's really important to know

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,039
where our food comes from

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
and this isn't about sort of farm to

106
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,959
farm to fork

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,719
that sort of thing but more about um

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,039
where the species came from

109
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
how they originated which traits were

110
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,120
involved and what genes were involved

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
and when we think about climate change

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
and food security

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
we're going to have to get more food

114
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,000
from less land

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,680
so if we can know more about the genes

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,199
involved in yield

117
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,959
and abiotic and biotic tolerances

118
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
and that's exactly what we need at the

119
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,280
moment

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
so why eggplant well firstly i think

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
it's just generally a really interesting

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
crop in and of itself

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
i've got here on the right a picture of

124
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
a wild eggplant and obviously a

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
domesticated eggplant

126
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
the wild eggplant fruits are only a

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
couple of centimeters in diameter

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
and you can probably see there that

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,479
there's thorns all over there and the

130
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,560
calyx and the stems as well

131
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,039
so it's gone quite a long way in

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
evolutionary terms to get from the

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
the small fruited very bitter tasting

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,879
wild eggplant to the

135
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,918
um very large purple

136
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,240
much more um mild tasting eggplants that

137
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,918
we would cook ourselves

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,519
so i think eggplant is interesting in

139
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,599
and of itself um

140
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,959
but because it's in the solanaceae it's

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
related to

142
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,039
several other crops we've got tomatoes

143
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
tomatoes however you want to do it i

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,520
didn't know how i was going to pronounce

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,560
it um tomatoes potatoes

146
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,319
peppers chilis and even tobacco as well

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,918
as in the same family

148
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,839
and for some of the traits and for some

149
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,279
of the crops there's definite parallels

150
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,279
in evolution

151
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,038
fruit size and fruit color and fruit

152
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,679
shape are some of the obvious ones

153
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,000
but we've also got changes in plant

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
architecture and things like that

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
and the tomato research tends to be a

156
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,038
little bit

157
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
further ahead the eggplant and that's

158
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,439
largely because more people eat more

159
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,759
tomatoes than they do eggplants

160
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,079
going back to the money side of things

161
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
so in eggplant we can piggyback to a

162
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,199
certain degree

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
on some of the some of the work that's

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,840
been done in tomatoes

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,519
and just to highlight this parallel

166
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,119
evolution so

167
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,599
i've got here a table from a paper

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
that's almost 20 years old now doing qtl

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
mapping in eggplants

170
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
and there was some significant crossover

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,039
in the qtls found in eggplants

172
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,879
as there was found in tomatoes so um

173
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,959
this is based on the same genomic

174
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,279
position so at the moment we don't know

175
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,038
if the same genes are involved but

176
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,799
there's reasonably good evidence that at

177
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,439
least there's some parallels for things

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
like

179
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,600
fruit weight fruit shape anthocyanins

180
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,799
and a stripe on some of the tomatoes and

181
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
some of the

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,960
eggplants as well so it's a really nice

183
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,959
study system for several reasons

184
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,478
so what do we already know so i started

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,639
this project in about 2014

186
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,560
and before this there was a bit of

187
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,079
phylogenetic work looking at the origins

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
of eggplant

189
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,439
and this map on the left shows how the

190
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
different

191
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,839
uh taxa and and subspecies however you

192
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
want to call it are related to each

193
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,399
other

194
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,478
so in africa we have a range of wild

195
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,359
eggplants and it's thought that there

196
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,159
was um

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:51,199
transport to um sort of china in india

198
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
um from the north of the range um in

199
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,240
africa

200
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,560
and this is where the domestication

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,598
happens so so that's shown by the yellow

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
star

203
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,879
and this gave rise to the sort of

204
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
primitive um

205
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,199
small fruited eggplants which then went

206
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,879
on to be domesticated into the large

207
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
fruited eggplants

208
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,399
but also from these small fruited

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
eggplants we have got

210
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,318
um regression potentially back into

211
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,439
being

212
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,598
weedy forms so eggplant is

213
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,038
um wild eggplant is often seen as a weed

214
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,279
in farmers fields

215
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,199
and potentially this is actually derived

216
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,318
from the primitive domesticates

217
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,240
as opposed to being undomesticated

218
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,840
true wild eggplant so rachel meyer as i

219
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
said before i've had a lot of contact

220
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,519
with her

221
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,519
she and she did a lot of work looking at

222
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,519
domesticated eggplants

223
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,959
and hypothesized more than one origin of

224
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,959
the domesticates

225
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,878
so she found significant differences

226
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,598
between a sort of western and an eastern

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,039
group

228
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:54,159
so separated into india nepal pakistan

229
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,878
versus um thailand burma places like

230
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
that

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,680
with a potential third origin in um the

232
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,039
philippines or malaysia

233
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,400
in the south east there so um the first

234
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,839
paper that i talked about

235
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,318
it didn't suggest any more than one

236
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,279
origin but the second paper i've just

237
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
talked about

238
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,559
potentially two or even three origins so

239
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,959
not only have we got um parallel

240
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,959
domestication of tomatoes and eggplants

241
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,799
but we might have parallel domestication

242
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,799
of different groups of eggplants as well

243
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
so why and how have these crops been

244
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
domesticated well

245
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,680
i've already said about the fruit size

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,879
and that's one of the dead giveaways

247
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
that differ

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
um i've got here a p in the center i've

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,958
got a picture of the

250
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,918
um a small part of the plant and we've

251
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,799
got

252
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,639
a lot of spines in the top photo and

253
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,199
this is the wild eggplant of course

254
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,278
it's got these uh one to two centimeter

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,399
long spines on the leaves the stems and

256
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,759
the calyx

257
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,000
whereas domesticated plants 99 times out

258
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,080
of 100 they don't have the spines at

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
all and on the right here i've just got

260
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
a zoomed in photo

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,920
to show you these spines and so i always

262
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
apologize to the undergraduates who are

263
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,120
coming to work with me

264
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
if they end up on an eggplant project

265
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
because unless they're solely working on

266
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
the domesticates

267
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
they may well end up with scratches all

268
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
down the back of their hands

269
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,399
when they're harvesting moving plants

270
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,399
and things like that

271
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,240
but it's not like every eggplant looks

272
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,439
the same so when you're walking around

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,480
the supermarkets

274
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,160
um you're probably going to see purple

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
eggplants that are about

276
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
eight inches long and they'll all fit

277
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,440
through a hole in a machine and

278
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,278
everything and they'll be very very

279
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
similar but this is some of the

280
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
diversity that you can find in the land

281
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,399
race eggplants

282
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,000
um apart from the couple of red

283
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,919
individuals in the middle these are all

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,559
the same species these are all

285
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,838
uh salem melons so they're all the same

286
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,679
species

287
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,200
so we've got massive chain um

288
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,719
differences in sizes

289
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,800
shapes i've got colors um ranging from

290
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,360
almost whitish to green through to

291
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,679
yellow and purples and almost reds

292
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
um i've got long thin eggplants short

293
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,159
fat round eggplants

294
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,240
everything in between as well so it's

295
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,559
super diverse compared to

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,759
um what a lot of people might expect

297
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,559
from a domesticated

298
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,559
uh species

299
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,720
so what we wanted to know was um using

300
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
a more up-to-date techniques we wanted

301
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,440
to re

302
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
revisit the multiple domestications

303
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
hypotheses

304
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,958
so was there one or more than one

305
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,159
domestication of eggplant

306
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,159
um where did this happen and um to look

307
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,919
into a couple of specific aspects of the

308
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,199
taxonomy as well

309
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,240
so there's two main things i wanted to

310
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,839
investigate so firstly we've got this

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,320
um potential for feral eggplants so

312
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,160
are they the weedy eggplants that are

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
found in farmers field

314
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,838
actually derived from the domesticates

315
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,200
and then they've sort of

316
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,440
um been re-wilded or are they just wild

317
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
eggplants

318
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,200
pre-domestication so to speak and

319
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
there's also a group of cultivars which

320
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
have been

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,559
either called sub-species of vigilant or

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
selena movidurum on their own

323
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,479
and avigirom obviously sort of

324
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
egg-shaped and they have fruits they're

325
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
about the size of a chicken's egg so

326
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,879
so not very large at all and some

327
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
taxonomists have said that this is a

328
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,919
separate species

329
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
others have said they're just primitive

330
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,120
domesticates

331
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,839
and others have said that they're

332
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,200
they're a specific group of domesticates

333
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,360
that um humans have selected on since

334
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
the domestication of eggplant so we've

335
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,879
got a few hypotheses to test

336
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,958
and we wanted to use um more sort of

337
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,519
genomic scale markers to investigate

338
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,278
this

339
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,278
because the reason the research prior to

340
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,039
this was either looking at

341
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,200
three or four nuclear genes or

342
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,439
chloroplast gene sequences

343
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,759
or they were using aflps and a mixture

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,760
of aflps and its sequences

345
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,759
and so what we did is genotyping by

346
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,600
sequencing so as

347
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,919
margaret can attest the genome of

348
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,879
eggplant is pretty big it's not huge but

349
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,599
it's

350
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,720
it's not manageable um when we were

351
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
starting up the lab

352
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,600
so um we did genotyping by sequencing of

353
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
95 accessions

354
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
and this demography work has been

355
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,320
published i've put a link there as well

356
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,159
and we've we tried to get a mixture of

357
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,879
all the different gene pools so we've

358
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,679
got

359
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,600
wild eggplants we've got selenium

360
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,039
avigirum so whether that's primitive or

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
whether that's derived we wanted to

362
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,319
investigate that

363
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,759
and we looked at land races from

364
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
throughout indochina

365
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,519
so almost everywhere where the land

366
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,919
races are grown

367
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
um in quite large amounts we looked at

368
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,679
those

369
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,759
we stayed away from um the sort of

370
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,159
highly inbred cultivars

371
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,000
because i i think for a lot of cultivars

372
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,679
there's a reasonable chance of

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,320
them being transported all over the

374
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,359
world strange hybrids being produced

375
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
that may have

376
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
uh different qualities that the breeders

377
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,159
are interested

378
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,399
so there's a good chance that

379
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,600
any gbs data we got from these plants

380
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,759
would just

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
um it wouldn't necessarily be reliable

382
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,078
as to the origin of that

383
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,679
land race in particular so we stuck to

384
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,838
the land races we didn't look at the

385
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,078
improved varieties

386
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,120
um after doing the gbs we ended up with

387
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,239
nearly 5000

388
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,240
snips we did some phylogenetics and we

389
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
looked at the population of structure

390
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,200
population structure as well so again

391
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
trying to address these questions about

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,680
where and when um or where and how many

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600
times the eggplant was domesticated

394
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,679
and these questions about the taxonomy

395
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,199
as well that were previously

396
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,799
only hypothesized so this is a

397
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,000
phylogenetic tree of the

398
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,679
snip data and i've broken it down into

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
three red boxes and i'm going to talk

400
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,159
about them separately on the next slides

401
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
and on the right we've got structure

402
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,120
plots i'm not going to talk too much

403
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,799
about those

404
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,519
but you can see there does seem to be

405
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,958
population structure being pulled out

406
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
and the legends at the bottom but the

407
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,039
legend will be on all the slides

408
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,439
so we've got out groups in black we've

409
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,799
got selenium in sarnam so that's the

410
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,760
wild progenitor

411
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,559
that's in light blue three geographic

412
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,720
groups of cultivars selena melonjana

413
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,679
and purple is the selenium of vigilante

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,920
egg-shaped fruits

415
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,319
so looking at the wild so we we pulled

416
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,799
out a reasonable amount of phylogenetic

417
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
structure in terms of the wild species

418
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,278
so

419
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,600
in blue we've got selenium and sun and

420
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,519
that's our progenitor species

421
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,759
and then we've got three other species

422
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,120
that came out in monophyletic groups

423
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,278
lichtensteinier linea mining carnam and

424
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,360
the first two are found only in africa

425
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,919
and the third selena mean carnum and

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
it's

427
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,078
it does get confusing because we've got

428
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,078
an enchantment in insane but they are

429
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,278
clearly different based on their

430
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,278
genetics

431
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,439
but incarname is found in very north

432
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,838
africa moving into the middle east

433
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,760
so this is possibly where the wild

434
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
progenitor was actually derived from and

435
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,439
that

436
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,519
seems to match our phylogenetic work

437
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,760
um something to note within in salem

438
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,600
there seems to be two separate groups

439
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
um i don't know if you see my mouse but

440
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,040
i'm i'm pointing to it now i've got

441
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,800
margaret nodding so that's fine

442
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,719
so there's sort of two groups these two

443
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,359
accessions are from india

444
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
and then these accessions are a mixture

445
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
from

446
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,599
um more like thailand

447
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,639
uh trying to think thailand vietnam

448
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,879
philippines and

449
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,440
malaysia so it looks like in the wild

450
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,159
progenitor there's two

451
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,320
quite different genetic groups and it

452
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,480
looks like the domesticated eggplant is

453
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
domesticated in the east so

454
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,839
from malaysia thailand vietnam that sort

455
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,000
of area

456
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,399
so then we've got this sort of slightly

457
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,320
messy

458
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
group in the phylogeny where well it's

459
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
not even a group really

460
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,560
it's the sort of thing that no one likes

461
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,159
to see in a phylogeny because

462
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,399
it's very hard to say what's going on

463
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,159
here but we've called this a gradation

464
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,639
so we're moving from

465
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,399
very wild like genetically and

466
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
phenotypically plants

467
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,639
up into the kind of almost looking

468
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,159
domestic type plants

469
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
and this is where almost all of the

470
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,600
avidurum falls so all the purple dots

471
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,360
is about uh nine or ten they pretty much

472
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
all fall out in this group

473
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
so it does suggest that avigiram is a

474
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,240
primitive domestica

475
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,359
however we did some approximate bayesian

476
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,278
computation

477
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,720
so testing different phylogenetic

478
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,480
hypotheses

479
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
and it actually looks like this group

480
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,360
they may be um

481
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,000
they may be partly because of gene flow

482
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,159
so

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
there may be some hybridization going on

484
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,480
these aren't necessarily

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,278
just primitive domesticates they seem to

486
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,079
be kind of primitive but with gene flow

487
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,759
um from other domesticates so they're a

488
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,559
bit messy in terms of their genomes

489
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,159
basically

490
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,159
but i think we can safely say they're

491
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,399
not a derived group

492
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,159
like a single derived group from the

493
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,919
domesticates

494
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,000
um and there's a couple of other things

495
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,759
in here we've got things that appear to

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,958
be wild and things that appear to be

497
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
land races

498
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,879
so there's definitely this gradation

499
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,000
between true wild and

500
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,480
and land race i think in implants um

501
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,279
and because um geographically they do

502
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
overlap

503
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,558
i think it's reasonable to expect that

504
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,400
there is some gene flow

505
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,038
and there has been work measuring gene

506
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,679
flow and there are domesticated alleles

507
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,640
found in wild populations in some parts

508
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
of india

509
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,079
so certainly based on previous

510
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,159
hypotheses

511
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,599
i don't think we can say this is unusual

512
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
it just seems to be that there's some

513
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:37,519
gene flow messing up

514
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,519
any sort of clear genetic groupings here

515
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,679
but then we move into the domesticated

516
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,679
groups and you'll see there's mainly two

517
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,919
groups within the domesticates

518
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
um at the top we've got almost all the

519
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
indian accessions

520
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,678
and at the bottom we've got southeast

521
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,640
asia so the mainland south east asia as

522
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
well as the

523
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,240
malay peninsula philippines and places

524
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,719
like that

525
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
so it does look like a single origin in

526
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
or around

527
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,558
malaysia or vietnam or thailand and then

528
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,759
these sort of two genetic groups within

529
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,879
the cultivated

530
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:11,839
a more western group into india

531
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,520
and pakistan and a more eastern group

532
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,359
where we think the domestication took

533
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,279
place

534
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,279
um just two things to highlight well one

535
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,839
thing to highlight twice i guess

536
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,720
in both of these groups we've got um

537
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,000
plants that look

538
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,240
wild and these are actually these four

539
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,839
accessions are all ones that were called

540
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,880
feral eggplants

541
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,599
so what it does seem to show us

542
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
is that these feral weedy eggplants that

543
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,678
are found in farmers field

544
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,279
fields they do seem to be derived from

545
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
the domesticates

546
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,200
so i think that kind of answers that

547
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,639
question about where they came from and

548
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,319
whether they are just

549
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,000
true wilds which i'd say don't know

550
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,519
they're not or whether they're derived

551
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,839
from the domesticas

552
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,440
and again we did the abc the approximate

553
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,918
bayesian computation

554
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,400
and again it's uh the most likely origin

555
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,559
of these is through hybridization so

556
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,320
they're potentially domestic as they

557
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,879
have escaped cultivation

558
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,079
and have ended up um hybridizing with

559
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
wild egg plants

560
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,119
and ended up with this sort of hybridy

561
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,200
genome

562
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,319
um but largely this tells us that the

563
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,319
ferals they're not

564
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,519
true wilds they do seem to be derived

565
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,439
from the domesticates

566
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,200
or at least a portion of their genomes

567
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
seem to be domesticated

568
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,558
so just summing that up so in terms of

569
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,798
the demography and

570
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,918
where and when all these things happened

571
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,558
it looks like we have a single

572
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,640
domestication in southeast asia

573
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,839
selena mobiduram seems to be a primitive

574
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,919
domesticate but there

575
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,359
there is some level of hybridization and

576
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,280
admixture

577
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,199
and some of the um phenotypically wild

578
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,240
eggplants do seem to be derived from the

579
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
domesticas

580
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,160
but they may be derived with some

581
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,839
ongoing gene flow as well

582
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
so something we also wanted to look at

583
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,918
was genes under selection so

584
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,599
as i said before this is quite often one

585
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,799
of the targets of a domestication

586
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,839
investigation

587
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,918
so to do this we did we did rnac so

588
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,879
when we did the gbs the genotyping by

589
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,640
sequencing

590
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
these are random loci from throughout

591
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,960
the genome and i think the chances of

592
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,440
more than a few percent of those ending

593
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,279
up in genes is very slim

594
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
so what we wanted to do was actually try

595
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,240
and zoom in on genes that may have been

596
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
under selection

597
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,079
so we sequence transcriptomes um which

598
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,038
are generally a lot smaller than a

599
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,359
genome

600
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,158
um not necessarily easier to assemble

601
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,399
but at least

602
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,919
um you know that you're the reads you

603
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,240
get are from coding regions

604
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,600
by and large so for this exam

605
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,720
for this study i'm going to talk about

606
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,000
28 individuals we did sequence some more

607
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,839
but when we sorted out all the

608
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,279
phylogenetic work some of our

609
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,079
individuals seem to be

610
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,519
admixed so we've avoided those in this

611
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,720
in this story but we've still got the

612
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,679
data

613
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
and we looked at um the wild eggplant

614
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,559
which is insane

615
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,400
we only ended up sequencing four of

616
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,359
those because some of the wilds ended up

617
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
being hybridy

618
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,678
and we tried to ignore those we've got

619
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,360
three of another wild species in carnum

620
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,798
which we think is the progenitor of

621
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,639
incernum

622
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,319
we looked at six of avigirom that's the

623
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
one with the egg-shaped fruits

624
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,798
and 15 melange the domesticates we

625
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,599
looked only at land races again

626
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,400
and we looked at leaves because um if

627
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,480
you imagine

628
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
comparing the transcriptomes of fruit

629
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,440
you've got very large very small

630
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,919
green yellow red fruits and stuff like

631
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
that

632
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,200
whereas if you look at the seedlings and

633
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,320
you look at the leaves they're much more

634
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
similar so

635
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,439
what we're not doing is enriching for

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,359
things um

637
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,880
that just happen to be because the fruit

638
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,240
is larger for example

639
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
and then you just pull out loads of

640
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
genes involved in fruit enlargement

641
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,720
which may or may not been under

642
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,319
selection during domestication

643
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,839
so anyway so this is how it's broken

644
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,200
down

645
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,959
so the first thing we did we measured

646
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,279
genetic diversity

647
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,798
um and there's about a 50 percent drop

648
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,399
in diversity during eggplant

649
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,319
domestication so

650
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,480
um well 47 so comparing insane to a

651
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,519
vigiran so this is going from wild to

652
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
primitive

653
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,000
we've got about 47 reduction in

654
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,919
nucleotide diversity

655
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,279
and then we've got another small drop as

656
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,559
we get from a vigil

657
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,798
into the domesticates as well

658
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,879
so this fits all our hypotheses about

659
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,879
how domestication works

660
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
in that the cultivars or the land races

661
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
we're looking at today

662
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,640
tend to have a subset of the genetic

663
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,558
variation present in the wild

664
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,159
and given that we only sampled four in

665
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,639
cyanum and 15

666
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,520
uh domesticas this seems pretty

667
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,360
substantial

668
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:40,319
drop as well we found

669
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,158
several fixed differences so there are

670
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,240
potential for these genes to be involved

671
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,440
in domestication phenotypes

672
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,519
so about 1400 during domestication

673
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,120
and then a very small number have fixed

674
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,558
differences between a vigilant and the

675
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,319
land races

676
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,558
but if you imagine that there are fixed

677
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,599
differences in alleles at

678
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,279
a gene involved in pathogen resistance

679
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,639
that absolutely makes sense that there

680
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,000
may be different pathogens in the

681
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
different environments

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
or it may be to do with fruit size fruit

683
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,200
shape plant stature things

684
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,440
like that um

685
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,519
so this amount of drop of diversity is

686
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,798
is nothing untoward it actually fits

687
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,279
fairly in the middle of other

688
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,200
other findings so maize and soybean the

689
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,519
genetic bottleneck is probably less than

690
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
this but in rice and common bean it's

691
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,639
probably

692
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,720
their bottleneck is probably stronger

693
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
than that so eggplant fits in the middle

694
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,519
of all of those crops

695
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,879
we did find um quite low diversity

696
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,720
overall though

697
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
so in the world progenitor almost a

698
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,880
quarter of the low cyber monomorphic

699
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,080
but of course we are zooming in on only

700
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,679
coding regions here

701
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,720
so there's no non-coding regions

702
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,880
involved so generally diversity is lower

703
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,919
and we found almost a third of the loci

704
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
in the

705
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,278
in the land races were monomorphic as

706
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
well

707
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,200
so that does lead us to a slight problem

708
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,719
so

709
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
what we wanted to do was look at

710
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,440
dropping nucleotide diversity so

711
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,120
compare the nucleotide diversity for

712
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
every locust where we had enough

713
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,399
information

714
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,480
compare the nucleotide diversity in the

715
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,679
wild and the nuclear tyre diversity in

716
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,360
the domesticate

717
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,519
and if we see a significant drop then um

718
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,959
we can presume that this locus was under

719
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,200
selection

720
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,880
the problem is that a third of the loci

721
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,679
are monomorphic in

722
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
the domesticals anyway so when we

723
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
actually run

724
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
tests like this we everything is

725
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,760
monomorphic in

726
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,639
um the domesticates so actually all

727
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,158
we're finding

728
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,919
is the genes that have the highest

729
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,760
variation in the wild

730
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
they don't necessarily correspond to

731
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,119
those that have had

732
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,360
the greatest drop in diversity because

733
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,639
they've all got no diversity at all

734
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,240
so we we did follow up on this by doing

735
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
some genome-wide work which i'll talk

736
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,679
about

737
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,840
next but because this is transcriptomes

738
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
and we sequenced all the plants on the

739
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,359
same day at the same time

740
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,319
they were all grown in the same ways we

741
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,439
could examine

742
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,798
new um expression divergence too

743
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
and i'm going to tell you about two

744
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,240
comparisons so comparing the wild to the

745
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,240
land races

746
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,640
and comparing the wild to the primitive

747
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,798
of igerum we've done the the other

748
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
other comparisons as well but um i don't

749
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,319
really need to go into all the details

750
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,319
here

751
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,960
so comparison a so this is going from

752
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,918
wild up to all the domesticates

753
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,240
we found almost well over 2000 loci were

754
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,000
differentially expressed and what was

755
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,839
quite interesting was that the majority

756
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,798
of these were either down regulated or

757
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,240
silenced so there wasn't a 50 50 mix of

758
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,359
up and down regulation

759
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,759
they were almost all down regulated

760
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,759
and then we compared when we compared

761
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,519
inside them and avigirum

762
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,960
we had almost a thousand differentially

763
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,200
expressed loci

764
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,159
and again a large number were down

765
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,360
regulated or silenced

766
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,320
so what this makes me think is that if

767
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,879
domestication

768
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,439
involved gene knockouts which is what it

769
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,120
our data seems to suggest for eggplant

770
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,519
this could certainly make things like

771
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,639
neo-domestication

772
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,798
easier because if the easiest way to get

773
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,679
from a small fruit to a large fruit

774
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,679
is to knock out three genes you can pay

775
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
someone to run crispr now and knock out

776
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,759
three genes

777
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,079
so potentially domestication of

778
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,000
other crops or improvement of more

779
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,879
primitive crops or um

780
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
less well well studied less um less

781
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,799
improved crops

782
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,319
it could be relatively easy i say

783
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,599
relatively easy i mean

784
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,759
it's still crisper it's not going to

785
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,839
work first time etc um

786
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,919
but people have done this so there's

787
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,000
some work here by lemonette al

788
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
where they looked at a wild solanaceae

789
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
and they knocked out some tomato

790
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,439
domestication genes

791
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,640
but they've also tried to redomesticate

792
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,759
tomato as well

793
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,320
by knocking out domestication genes so

794
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,079
um

795
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,158
it's quite interesting i think that the

796
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,558
majority of genes at least in eggplant

797
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,559
were down regulated or silenced

798
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,918
and with crispr you can go in and just

799
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,119
knock out genes

800
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,559
um essentially as as and when you want

801
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,959
so i think this is quite interesting

802
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,839
with potential for food security and

803
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,759
things like that as well

804
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,959
so we looked at all our differentially

805
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,440
expressed genes

806
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,319
and we measured fst so a measure of

807
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
genetic divergence basically relative

808
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,918
genetic divergence

809
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
between the different populations and

810
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,840
there's three comparisons shown here

811
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,919
and i've separated them into

812
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,798
differentially expressed which is d e of

813
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
course

814
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,960
and not differentially expressed and

815
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
you'll see in all of the comparisons

816
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
the differentially expressed genes have

817
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,879
a greater relative divergence

818
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,440
between the populations than the

819
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,320
non-differentially expressed genes

820
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,240
so this tells us that there is a

821
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,879
signature of selection at the nucleotide

822
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,319
level

823
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,440
because we've got an increase in

824
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,798
divergence between the two populations

825
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,558
so natural well humans have selected for

826
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,119
possibly an allele that's differentially

827
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,839
expressed and at the same time that's

828
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,918
um increase the amount of nucleotide

829
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,918
diversity between the populations

830
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,520
so selecting on one allele out of the

831
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,840
dozens that might be present

832
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,558
would increase your genetic divergence

833
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,959
as well

834
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,839
so this follows our sort of hypotheses

835
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,079
about

836
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,079
how human selection may be working

837
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,559
and of course we were interested in what

838
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,759
these genes were i've named a few here

839
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,440
but and we ran a go analysis as well

840
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,519
just to see if there was any categories

841
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
of genes that came out as differentially

842
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,398
expressed

843
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,159
and we've got some quite interesting go

844
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,918
terms that do fit what we know about

845
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,159
domestication so

846
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,278
we've got terms involved in defense so

847
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,360
this is

848
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,119
largely this was due to biotic defense

849
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,719
but there was some abiotic tolerance in

850
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,519
there as well

851
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,919
we've got jasmonic acid biosynthesis

852
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,679
jasmine jasminic acid being a plant

853
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,038
hormone so it's involved in growth and

854
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,840
things like that

855
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,919
and photoperiodism and flowering and of

856
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,759
course there's a reasonable chance that

857
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,278
domestication involves selection on

858
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,759
flowering because

859
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,398
farmers will want a field of eggplants

860
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,240
that are

861
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,239
flowering and future fruiting at

862
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
approximately the same time

863
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,079
rather than what might happen in the

864
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,320
wild and a farmer having to go out and

865
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,439
pick a few eggplants every day for three

866
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,798
or four months

867
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,558
so these go terms do make sense um just

868
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,839
zooming in on a couple of genes

869
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,480
this is a couple to do with uh fungal

870
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,798
resistance and

871
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,558
and that that makes sense because humans

872
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,918
would have probably selected on

873
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,759
resistant genotypes um and there's also

874
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,038
two genes here gigantia and early

875
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,798
flowering three

876
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,558
and they've been shown in arabidopsis to

877
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:41,440
be involved in photoperiodism and

878
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,200
flowering

879
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,960
and these two genes actually directly

880
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,759
interact at least in

881
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,840
arabidopsis so this this is this is

882
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,519
quite a nice little story that we are

883
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,038
and we're doing a bit more work on this

884
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,960
now trying to get a bit

885
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,960
more information about where and when

886
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,720
these genes are being expressed

887
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,840
and how that differs between a wild and

888
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,038
a domesticated eggplant

889
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,038
i'll just take a breath now

890
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,439
so as i mentioned when we tried to look

891
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,798
at nucleotide diversity on a gene by

892
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,960
gene basis

893
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,000
we've got so many monomorphic loci in

894
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,319
the eggplant

895
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,278
that any tests on a gene by gene basis

896
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,678
were simply

897
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,398
pulling out high diversity in the wild

898
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,798
genes

899
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,079
as opposed to candidate domestication

900
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,240
genes

901
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,839
but during or well towards the end of

902
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,519
anna's phd

903
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,359
um there was a new version of the

904
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,960
eggplant genome came out

905
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,759
so the old version was quite highly

906
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,038
fragmented and we didn't try and do

907
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,158
genome guided transcriptomics but later

908
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,240
on this better

909
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,559
um more contiguous genome was released

910
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
so what we did is we mapped the rna-seq

911
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,398
reads to the genome

912
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,319
and we use this to look for not

913
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,119
individual loci that may have been under

914
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,519
selection

915
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,479
but actually chunks of the genome which

916
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,480
contain

917
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,159
multiple loci with a signature of

918
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,960
selection

919
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
and we did this by calculating fst which

920
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,519
is what i mentioned on a couple of

921
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,919
slides previously

922
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,558
where it's looking at divergence so high

923
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,240
fst

924
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,480
between a wild and a domesticated

925
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,519
population does suggest

926
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,200
adaptive divergence or the influence of

927
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,798
human selection

928
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,558
and we measured pi as well which is

929
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,558
nucleotide diversity

930
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,639
and we did it over chunks of the genome

931
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,038
of 450 kb

932
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
because we think that ld drops off

933
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,798
fairly low

934
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,640
within about 450 kb although we don't

935
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,278
have great data for that at the moment

936
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,759
so

937
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,359
we had to pick a window size and this is

938
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,720
fitted and it was functional kind of

939
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,719
thing

940
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,319
um and just to highlight so this is not

941
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
eggplant data this is just what we're

942
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,359
looking for

943
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,038
and so if there's a region of the genome

944
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,038
with this very strong selection and i've

945
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,599
shown it by this red box

946
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,359
we might expect pi to be significantly

947
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,278
lower than the rest of the genome

948
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,199
because we've lost genetic diversity

949
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,000
through a selective sweep

950
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,440
and we might expect fst to be um higher

951
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,278
than the genome average we've

952
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,360
because we've got more differences

953
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,599
between the wild and the domesticated

954
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,879
as expected baseball based on the rest

955
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,519
of the genome

956
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,720
but this is an eggplant data however

957
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,480
this is

958
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,640
so this is all the chromosomes stacked

959
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,679
up from chromosome 1 to 12 going left to

960
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
right

961
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
alternating between gray and black gray

962
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,639
and black

963
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,558
and i've got fst at the top and

964
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
pi at the bottom and pi is actually

965
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,319
getting higher as you go further down

966
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,480
fst obviously getting higher is the

967
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,278
further up so what we're looking for is

968
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,720
regions of high fst and low pi

969
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,119
and i've highlighted three of those

970
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,600
regions that came out which had both a

971
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,079
high

972
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,519
fst and a low pi they're on three

973
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,079
different chromosomes

974
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,319
and each is about four to six megabases

975
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,319
long

976
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,440
and if we look at them we've got um

977
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,439
the the region sizes sorry they're

978
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,759
between about six and eight

979
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
megabases long each one has several

980
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,200
hundred genes in of course so

981
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,439
um because we haven't got

982
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,880
transcriptomics from very very large

983
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,278
numbers of plants

984
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
um we can't really zoom in on very small

985
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,319
windows

986
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,879
um so we're not saying that there's a

987
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,119
one gene in each of these three loci

988
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,880
um that we're particularly interested in

989
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,719
and we've got over a thousand genes to

990
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,000
follow up which is nearly four percent

991
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,519
of the eggplant genome

992
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,880
so that's quite a lot for us to follow

993
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,558
up on but and i did do some go analysis

994
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
and there was an over-representation of

995
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,558
genes involved in

996
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,839
photosynthesis in the biosynthesis of

997
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,240
the photosystems

998
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,240
in chlorophyll and in the chloroplasts

999
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,960
and so this is not the same as we found

1000
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,278
with the rnac differential expression

1001
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,038
but it does seem to make sense that

1002
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,240
humans may have selected on higher

1003
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,158
productivity

1004
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,159
and chances are that involves some

1005
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,559
regulation of photosynthesis

1006
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,519
chlorophyll chloroplasts and things like

1007
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,678
that

1008
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,038
um but this is just based on three

1009
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,240
regions of the genome and several

1010
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,240
hundred genes so

1011
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,519
we've got a bit more to follow up on

1012
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,720
before we can say

1013
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,558
specifically what genes we think are um

1014
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,440
key to the transition from wild to

1015
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,440
domesticated

1016
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,519
but what we have done is zoomed in on

1017
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,918
one particular trait which is this

1018
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:18,480
spininess that i talked about

1019
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,078
so on the left here i've got um a wild

1020
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,918
and a domesticated eggplant

1021
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,839
this isn't the wild the true wild

1022
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,358
progenitor this is a special species

1023
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,960
called liniana

1024
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,878
and at the bottom we've got the leaves

1025
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,119
and they're actually switched round so

1026
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:34,559
the domesticated leaf is on the left

1027
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,519
with the wild leaf on the right and

1028
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,838
the paper i mentioned from 2002 they did

1029
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,719
a qtl mapping population crossing these

1030
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,719
two

1031
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,239
uh these two species and generating an

1032
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,000
f2

1033
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,838
and they looked at a number of different

1034
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,119
traits they looked at fruit size fruit

1035
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,639
shape fruit color

1036
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,559
they looked at aspects of leaf

1037
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,639
morphology sizes

1038
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,719
shapes things like that and they did

1039
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,480
also look at spininess as well

1040
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,639
and as i said before that's one of the

1041
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,920
conspicuous differences between

1042
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,118
um wild wild eggplants and domesticated

1043
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,119
eggplants

1044
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,760
and actually the the eggplant is in a

1045
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,559
clay called the spiny salinas

1046
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,680
so it's not just the wild progenitor

1047
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,000
that's spiny

1048
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,159
but most of the eggplants in this group

1049
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,480
are spiny eggplants

1050
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,239
um so anyway so what we wanted to do was

1051
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,639
kind of follow up on this and look at in

1052
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,879
a bit more detail

1053
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,480
um this is the qtl map that we were

1054
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,800
working with on the left so it's quite a

1055
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,320
large chunk of the genome

1056
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
and on the right this is just slightly

1057
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,960
more updated um

1058
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,400
it's looking at the same traits though

1059
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,000
and it's looking at

1060
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,599
the population grown in different

1061
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,838
environments now

1062
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,280
but what you'll notice is that all the

1063
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,000
different prickles

1064
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,920
of the phenotypes that were mentioned a

1065
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
lot of them stack up in this one region

1066
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,838
of chromosome six

1067
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
so we've got spines on the stem the

1068
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,400
leaves the ptos

1069
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,519
and the fruit and the flower calyx they

1070
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,559
all stack up in one region of the genome

1071
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,599
so even though there are smaller qtl all

1072
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,880
over the genome there is this one large

1073
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,039
one region of the genome that

1074
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
corresponds to a relatively large amount

1075
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,800
of the genetic variation

1076
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,000
and we talked to marie christine dornay

1077
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,440
who is at inra

1078
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,239
in france and she's been selfing this f2

1079
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,599
population

1080
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,118
to generate reals so what we did is we

1081
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,640
got some rails from her

1082
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,800
and we got some original um f2s as well

1083
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,639
seed from the f2s and we did some

1084
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,039
genotyping

1085
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,480
and one of the first things we realized

1086
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,119
was that

1087
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,599
um there's basically a binary switch

1088
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,119
between

1089
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,200
presence and absence of spines

1090
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,519
and it maps to this region of chromosome

1091
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:52,960
six and the other qtl

1092
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:56,400
all correspond to the size of the spines

1093
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
so you need to have the the wild allele

1094
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
at this

1095
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
qtl from eggplant chromosome 6 to have

1096
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,679
any spines

1097
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,440
and then multiple qtl around the genome

1098
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,480
will give rise to larger or smaller

1099
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,159
spines

1100
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,079
so what we were doing is we wanted to

1101
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,799
zoom in on this sort of binary switch

1102
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,320
almost

1103
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,280
for the presence absence so we started

1104
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,440
out with a seven

1105
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,119
megabase region which is largely based

1106
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,559
on this genetic mapping

1107
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
and this is where it's used for having

1108
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,799
multiple crops because

1109
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,159
some of these markers are only found in

1110
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,720
tomato but the tomato chromosome 6 and

1111
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,559
the eggplant chromosome 6

1112
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,279
apart from a region at the top which has

1113
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,159
been flipped they're largely co-linear

1114
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,480
so we could use data from tomato and the

1115
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,078
data from the eggplant genome which was

1116
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,559
coming online

1117
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,000
while we were doing this so we figured

1118
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,759
out this was approximately a seven

1119
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,480
megabase window

1120
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,640
um we generated 120 plants that

1121
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,599
segregated three to one spinach and non

1122
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,920
spiny

1123
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,760
so as i said before there's it looks

1124
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,400
like there's a mendelian locust

1125
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,960
controlling presence absence of spines

1126
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,720
and then within the spiny plants there's

1127
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,960
a gradation from

1128
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,759
um very small couple of millimeter

1129
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,280
spines

1130
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,960
up to the sort of one and a half

1131
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
centimeter spines that

1132
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,559
scratch the skin on the back of your

1133
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,880
hand when you get near to them

1134
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,799
um so the way what we wanted to do was

1135
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,119
zoom in on this seven megabase

1136
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,119
region so we generated some

1137
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,800
transcriptomes from linear i'm going to

1138
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,440
talk about that in a second

1139
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,599
and we map those to the eggplant genome

1140
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,400
and then we just simply looked for indel

1141
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,640
markers

1142
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,240
so then i had undergraduates in the lab

1143
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,319
who were scoring in dell markers in

1144
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,639
these 120 plants

1145
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
so we had 14 markers in this seven

1146
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,239
megabase region

1147
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,679
and we've zoomed in on about two

1148
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,319
megabases now

1149
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,919
um so two megabases is a sizable chunk

1150
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,119
it's still got a couple of hundred genes

1151
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,320
in it we think

1152
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,519
um but we have narrowed it down a bit

1153
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,039
um we're only looking at 120 plants

1154
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,639
um so i don't think based on those 120

1155
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,239
i don't think it's worth us throwing any

1156
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,159
more markers at it because we haven't

1157
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,358
got enough recombination in that area of

1158
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,078
the genome

1159
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,960
but what we did do is we collected some

1160
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,200
plants that were

1161
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,119
well we collected the see the fruit from

1162
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,838
some heterozygous plants

1163
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,358
and we've got from one of those we've

1164
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,599
got about a thousand seed

1165
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,920
and from another couple of plants we've

1166
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,838
got several hundred seeds so

1167
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,039
what we can do now is grow up the large

1168
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,599
populations

1169
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,440
um as margaret will attest an eggplant

1170
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,599
is a pretty sizable plant

1171
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
and so growing up a thousand plants is

1172
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,519
no mean feat

1173
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,119
however you can tell whether the plants

1174
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,039
are spiny or not spiny

1175
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,800
when they're only about um two or three

1176
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,519
months old and only

1177
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
six inches tall so this is something we

1178
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,159
we need obviously time and we need

1179
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,280
um uh someone to be able to do this but

1180
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,319
it is something that we're going to

1181
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,119
start next year

1182
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,200
i think so as i said we generated linear

1183
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,640
transcriptomes and what we did is we did

1184
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,439
six transcriptomes

1185
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,440
we did three from the spines and three

1186
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,599
from the veins because the spines on the

1187
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
leaves are formed out of the veins

1188
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,039
so what we wanted to do was look at

1189
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
differential expression

1190
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,199
between essentially a spine which is an

1191
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,839
elongated bit of a vein

1192
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,639
and another piece of vein and as i said

1193
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,519
we did it for

1194
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,000
three three different lineal implants

1195
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,838
and

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,440
we did differential expression to look

1197
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:24,400
at the genes that might be involved in

1198
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,079
this trait

1199
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,838
and this is just the sort of typical

1200
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,519
plot you see but um

1201
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,279
clearly we've got separation of the

1202
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,039
three veins

1203
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,319
on the right and no sorry the three

1204
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,800
veins on the left

1205
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,000
and the three spines on the right and

1206
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,119
these are all our differentially

1207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,639
expressed genes

1208
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,960
and so they fall out in two main

1209
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,960
clusters we've got high expression in

1210
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,400
the veins low expression in

1211
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,000
spines or vice versa so at the moment we

1212
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,880
can't really say whether it might be a

1213
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,639
knockout

1214
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,960
or an upregulation or anything like that

1215
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,799
um we found about point six percent of

1216
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,838
transcripts for de so quite a small

1217
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,200
number which

1218
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,838
is easier to work with and about 50 of

1219
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,239
these fell

1220
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,318
out in this two megabase region so i

1221
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,598
think what we secretly wanted was one or

1222
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,838
two genes

1223
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,519
in that two megabase region to also be

1224
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:17,039
differentially expressed

1225
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,880
um sadly we've got about 50 but some of

1226
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,639
them we can follow up on and

1227
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,480
there's a few interesting interesting

1228
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,879
candidates there's genes involved in the

1229
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,039
modification of cellulase and of course

1230
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,720
you've got cell walls being elongated so

1231
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,039
that makes sense

1232
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,480
um and other other genes that may or may

1233
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,400
not be involved

1234
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,079
and then there's a bunch of other genes

1235
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,440
as well um

1236
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,240
so we're not ready to say we've got one

1237
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,079
or even five or even 20 candidates

1238
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,838
but we have got enough data that we've

1239
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,760
got things to zoom in on

1240
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,279
and i think once we grow up our larger

1241
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,440
mapping population

1242
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,440
um hopefully we can zoom in on a smaller

1243
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,440
region of the genome

1244
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,200
and then we've got a bit more to sort of

1245
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,000
we can bring together our data a bit

1246
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,639
better

1247
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,480
to compare the differential expression

1248
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,400
we can look at um

1249
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
where they map and ideally you know

1250
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,639
finding potentially differentially

1251
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,920
expressed genes in this region although

1252
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,199
we don't know it's differentially

1253
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,559
expressed it might just be a

1254
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,639
polymorphism

1255
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,559
that um changes the coding sequence

1256
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,318
we've we've got no a priory reason to

1257
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,400
think it's differential expression

1258
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,400
but again it's a different um a

1259
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,480
different place to look

1260
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,960
um and just recently there was a

1261
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,079
selenium linear and genome released

1262
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,800
and it's not the most high quality but

1263
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,800
um we've mapped it back to the uh the

1264
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,200
domesticated eggplant genome

1265
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,880
and so we've now very easily we can go

1266
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,759
in and design hundreds of molecular

1267
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
markers

1268
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,359
just for this small region uh we just

1269
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,079
need time and we need a bit of space to

1270
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,480
get on with this

1271
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,599
right now um but we're quite happy we're

1272
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,760
quite enjoying this

1273
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,119
at the moment um i've had various people

1274
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,319
working on it and uh

1275
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,318
we seem to be getting closer anyway um

1276
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,838
so just to sum up i think i'm about

1277
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:02,000
40 40 minutes so that's not bad

1278
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,639
so we've got an interesting and a

1279
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,280
convoluted domestication of eggplant

1280
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,039
we've got post-domestication gene flow

1281
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,800
and we do have a lot of overlap between

1282
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,039
where these land races are grown

1283
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,839
and where the wildland wild eggplants

1284
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,960
are found

1285
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:19,279
so it's not unexpected we've got escape

1286
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,480
from domestication so we've got

1287
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
quite an interesting potential

1288
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,440
evolutionary story about

1289
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,800
d domestication and whether you get

1290
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,240
how this kind of reversal of the

1291
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,960
domestication syndrome comes about

1292
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,000
lots of candidate genes so we've got a

1293
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,318
lot to work with

1294
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,239
um it's a fun time to be working on

1295
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,279
eggplants but at the same time it's

1296
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,838
it's this sort of giant excel sheets and

1297
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,359
our documents with hundreds of different

1298
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,838
uh things in that we need to

1299
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,759
uh look at but we do seem to be getting

1300
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,519
closer at least to this one trait

1301
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,280
um that we're particularly interested in

1302
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,039
so that's quite exciting

1303
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,599
and we are sort of zooming in on it

1304
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,159
right now

1305
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,640
so just to acknowledge uh people so anna

1306
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,039
was the phd student who did

1307
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,078
a lot of the demography jane helped us

1308
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,358
out with some of the more tricky

1309
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,119
bioinformatics

1310
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,119
and rachel she supplied us with some

1311
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,880
seed and i think she may have illegally

1312
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,720
sent it to us through the post

1313
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,240
um but we we grew it and we threw the

1314
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,199
plants away we didn't grow in our own

1315
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,039
gardens

1316
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,199
um i've had a few undergraduates and

1317
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,519
masters students working on this

1318
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,318
uh too many to name but a lot of those

1319
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:25,920
underground

1320
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,318
graduates have been trolling through the

1321
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,079
ndlp pcr and stuff

1322
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,358
um special thanks to mary christine

1323
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,280
dornea inra

1324
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,400
because she was she didn't just supply

1325
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,680
the seed but

1326
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,000
she has been maintaining these

1327
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,838
populations um and she's obviously

1328
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
supplied a lot to margaret as well

1329
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,358
so she's still involved and she's still

1330
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,520
interested which is great

1331
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,880
and i had funding from the university

1332
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,239
when i got there i got an annual

1333
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,079
adventures grant

1334
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,439
and i'd like to thank margaret as well

1335
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,519
for the invite it's really

1336
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
really interesting to talk to you guys

1337
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,880
um and thanks cornell as well for

1338
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,559
hosting as well um i'd obviously be

1339
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
happy to take any questions i presume

1340
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,119
that's where we're going next is that

1341
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,119
right

1342
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,160
yes thank you mark for a wonderful

1343
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,480
season and thank you to the zoom gods

1344
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,279
for

1345
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,920
a smooth connection amazing like eight

1346
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,319
well

1347
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,200
five thousand miles away and nosing zone

1348
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,559
problems

1349
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,399
great um great so

1350
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,078
open it up to questions you can either

1351
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,880
type in the chat or

1352
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,640
um you can just unmute yourself and ask

1353
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,920
your question

1354
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,719
i see there is a question here

1355
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
developmentally how do the spines form

1356
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,039
and it's the absence of spines due to a

1357
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,280
failure of specification

1358
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,838
cool i don't think we know i mean i

1359
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,519
think

1360
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,358
i think once we get closer to knowing

1361
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,000
what the candidate gene might be

1362
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,519
or what the sort of presence absence

1363
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,480
gene might be i think that's going to

1364
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,480
help

1365
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,960
they do seem to just grow out of the

1366
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,199
veins it's it's hard to say

1367
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,039
exactly what tissues or exactly what

1368
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,759
cell types are involved

1369
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,279
um i think we we need to do a bit of

1370
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
work on that i have been talking to

1371
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,119
people about doing

1372
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,720
um electron microscopy of the of the

1373
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,960
developing spines

1374
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,399
um that was a conversation that started

1375
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,079
about a year ago and obviously we all

1376
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,119
know what happened about nine months ago

1377
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,880
so um that's put on hold for now

1378
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,200
i think we we would like to know a bit

1379
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,119
more and i think it will help us find

1380
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,838
candidate genes as well so if we know

1381
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,318
it's

1382
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,199
an elongation of the cell wall or if we

1383
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,119
know it's a breakdown in some

1384
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,399
compound that would normally constrain

1385
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,000
the cell wall

1386
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
we can start zooming in on that whether

1387
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,960
it's lignin or something like that

1388
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,199
um but developmentally they they don't

1389
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,760
seem to be the same as trichomes in

1390
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,279
tomatoes which is a bit disappointing

1391
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,319
because obviously if it was the same

1392
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,079
developmentally

1393
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,920
we've got candidate genes we can start

1394
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
looking at but i don't think

1395
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,960
we can do that because they don't seem

1396
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,559
to be developmentally the same as a

1397
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,000
trichome

1398
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:00,400
um they they're multicellular right

1399
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,239
yeah they're multicellular yeah cool

1400
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,318
yeah um adrian the

1401
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,598
professor who asked the question works

1402
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,358
on live cell imaging

1403
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:12,400
um so that would be a great system

1404
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:15,440
um to do live imaging okay yeah so

1405
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,079
sounds good jim um a question from jeff

1406
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,679
doyle

1407
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,400
um are you working on working on more of

1408
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,960
the messy

1409
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,519
gene flow issues um using network

1410
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,039
methods

1411
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,519
perhaps yeah we we have actually been

1412
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,119
doing that

1413
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,880
so we've got at the moment we've got a

1414
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,400
project on brassicas and

1415
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,280
um the the postdoc who's working on that

1416
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,400
um she's now getting very adept at all

1417
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,920
these network

1418
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,599
type um doing gene-based phylogenies and

1419
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,039
putting them together to make networks

1420
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
and things like that so

1421
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,519
yeah we are following up with that

1422
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,160
actually um this was published

1423
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,079
over a year ago and since then we've got

1424
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,000
a lot of the brassica data and

1425
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,240
turns out brassica's a real mess as well

1426
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,760
so um actually the postdoc's probably

1427
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,679
going to apply some of their skills to

1428
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,119
this eggplant data

1429
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,519
very cool um i have a

1430
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,800
question and then hamid has a question

1431
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,318
i'll ask him to

1432
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,160
unmute himself for his because it's a

1433
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,838
two-part um

1434
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,399
if he's okay with that but i'll i'll

1435
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:20,078
start um i'm interested in those

1436
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,440
um feral uh kind of

1437
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,640
weedy species that you identified um

1438
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,760
do you think that their like f1 hybrids

1439
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,440
are like really close to the

1440
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,359
hybridization event and thus

1441
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,519
exhibiting hybrid vigor and that kind of

1442
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,078
helps them be successful as weedy

1443
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,639
species

1444
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,119
or is it more of a situation where

1445
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,318
they've

1446
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,519
kind of um hybridized uh

1447
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:46,639
several generations ago and then um

1448
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,239
yeah i i don't think i don't know i i

1449
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,159
don't think these are sort of early

1450
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,039
generation hybrids that are super

1451
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,440
heterotic

1452
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,199
and then just manage to live everywhere

1453
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,039
um

1454
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,480
we did a bit of work which we couldn't

1455
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,800
really conclude much from so i'm

1456
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,199
hesitant to talk about it too much so

1457
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,079
take this off with a pinch of salt but

1458
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,118
what we did

1459
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,039
is we looked in these feral um we

1460
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,240
we had some transcriptomes from the

1461
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,279
ferals

1462
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:17,279
and it seems

1463
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,400
like a non insignificant proportion

1464
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,200
of the loci that are introgressed do

1465
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,680
seem to be candidates for being under

1466
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,480
selection during domestication so

1467
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,799
they have a largely domesticated genome

1468
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,760
and the bit that's introgressed

1469
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,119
seems to be enriched for genes that may

1470
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,400
have been under selection during

1471
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,318
domestication

1472
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:43,280
so it may be spiny genes dwarfing genes

1473
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,318
small fruit genes that have introgressed

1474
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,980
into the um

1475
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,440
domesticates um

1476
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,039
[Music]

1477
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,920
but we've we've got a long way to go

1478
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:55,119
with that so pinch yourself

1479
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,720
yeah very cool um are you okay

1480
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,680
asking your yes thank you sure uh great

1481
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,399
talk mark

1482
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,598
thank you thank you mate i have two

1483
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,039
questions one is

1484
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,760
uh you mentioned that obj has gene flow

1485
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,519
with the cultivated plants so i wonder

1486
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
if you have tested for gene flow with

1487
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,039
the wild

1488
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,039
ancestor also

1489
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,719
yeah let me try and think about that

1490
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,799
i think i think it's entirely probable

1491
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,959
that that has happened

1492
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,559
um i guess that as far as i remember

1493
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,240
that wasn't one of our scenarios we

1494
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,680
tested though

1495
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:34,799
um yeah i

1496
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,199
don't think i don't think we tested that

1497
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,440
so

1498
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,838
i couldn't really comment on that but i

1499
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,559
think there is a chance yeah absolutely

1500
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,799
and i was

1501
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,000
also wondering whether the fruit

1502
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,519
phenotypes are

1503
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,559
diverse in objero or

1504
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:53,199
do they all have egg shaped uh no

1505
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,119
so they they all well everything that's

1506
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,318
called a vigram is based on having these

1507
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,920
egg-shaped fruits

1508
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,558
so um phenotypically they are all very

1509
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,639
similar

1510
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,079
there's there's some sort of yellowish

1511
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,000
fruits and some

1512
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,680
very bright white fruits um but

1513
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,519
because there's so much diversity

1514
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,719
there's long and short and and fat and

1515
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,719
round and everything

1516
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,358
and i think everything has just been

1517
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,919
named a vigilant that looks about like

1518
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,279
that

1519
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,519
sure but in our phylogeny um even though

1520
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,359
they're all in that gradation i think

1521
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,679
there's two of idram

1522
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,039
vigilam accessions that are in the

1523
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,159
domesticas

1524
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:35,039
so it looks like they may be

1525
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:38,078
independently derived egg-shaped fruit

1526
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,358
cultivars um but i think they're found

1527
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,240
in very different places in the

1528
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:41,759
phylogeny

1529
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:43,439
and very different from where the other

1530
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,960
revision rooms are

1531
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,760
great thank you you're welcome and uh we

1532
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,400
have one more

1533
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,839
question from jim jiminy um given the

1534
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,200
presence the absence of

1535
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,119
unicorns um jim's wondering

1536
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,239
if you might expect something other than

1537
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,640
a cell wall candidate

1538
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,759
for example a transcription factor or

1539
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,960
kinase or other

1540
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,520
some other kind of master regulator um

1541
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,440
and you know perhaps you could take your

1542
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,559
mapping region and compare it to a

1543
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,760
non-spiny

1544
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,640
relative um like tomato to

1545
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,960
narrow yeah um actually so i've got a

1546
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,000
phd student starting after christmas who

1547
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,480
is going to be

1548
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,159
zooming in on this so we're going to use

1549
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,480
as much data as we can get

1550
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,199
so we've got one of the linearnum

1551
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,000
genomes

1552
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,078
we've got um we've got all the

1553
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,039
transcriptomes that we've generated

1554
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,640
we've got a small number of domesticated

1555
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,679
genomes and then we've got things like

1556
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,598
tomatoes

1557
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,919
and even potatoes if we want to go that

1558
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,800
far so what we'd like to do

1559
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,000
is try and throw together as much data

1560
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,359
as possible

1561
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,760
and it's interesting you mentioned

1562
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,159
kinases because in that region of the

1563
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,720
genome there are a few kinases

1564
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,679
and i know that kinase is a very broad

1565
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,719
topic

1566
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,960
or a broad category of genes but it does

1567
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:04,239
seem to be a cluster of kinases

1568
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,280
so that might be entirely circumspect

1569
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,919
and nothing to do with

1570
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,640
spines but it does seem that there is a

1571
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,680
cluster of kinases in that

1572
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,679
i'm excited to find out

1573
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:17,838
give me a year or two i'm not quite

1574
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,119
ready but yeah yeah

1575
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:22,318
great um so if there are no more

1576
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,559
questions join me

1577
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,759
in thanking mark for a wonderful talk

1578
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,000
and um

1579
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,880
tgi friday mark you're done with your

1580
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,159
day so

1581
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,000
thank you well no i've got to talk to

1582
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,519
some phd students now apparently in

1583
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,838
about

1584
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,599
10 minutes is that right oh great yes

1585
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,838
okay phd students um

1586
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,519
join mark you're not off the hook yet um

1587
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,400
it's fine no problem

1588
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,119
great thank you so much thank you i've

1589
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,119
really enjoyed it

1590
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,078
this has been a production of cornell
