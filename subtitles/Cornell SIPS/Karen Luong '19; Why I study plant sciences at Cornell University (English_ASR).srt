00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:07,068
University hi my name is Karen long and

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,169
I'm a transfer junior at the school of

4
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:11,539
integrated plant sciences also known as

5
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,160
sips I'm mostly interested in saying

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,258
plant pathology and that interest

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,910
started in high school where I took many

8
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,800
agricultural classes including

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,379
horticulture and in my horticulture

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,550
class two graduate students at the New

11
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,649
York State agriculture Experiment

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,929
Station came in with rotting fruit and

13
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:29,059
vegies and diseased plants and they

14
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:31,129
taught my class how to identify common

15
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,679
diseases and plants and how to manage

16
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:36,679
them senior year I had the opportunity

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,600
of interning at the Experiment Station

18
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,479
with plant pathologist for a couple of

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,640
days and I ran basic tests like gel

20
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,609
electrophoresis I learned how to

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,520
sequence DNA and even inoculated beans

22
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:52,420
with white mold I talked to the plant

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,140
pathologists about why doing research is

24
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,260
important and they told me that they do

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,659
research to recommend disease management

26
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,640
practices for farmers and they're part

27
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,099
of the solution for food security and

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,150
ever since that day I've decided to

29
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:12,548
pursue a career in plant pathology I've

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,930
always wanted to come to Cornell

31
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:17,180
probably because my agriculture teachers

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,509
in alumni and I've done internship

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,240
that's the station and the researchers I

34
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,540
worked under are both professors at sips

35
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,938
and they've influenced my decision to

36
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,290
come study here but I went to Community

37
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:32,478
College first for two years

38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,850
however my transition from Community

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,420
College to CIPS has been really smooth

40
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:40,699
and I appreciate how the Plant Sciences

41
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,430
program here includes

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,710
a wide array of concentrations like

43
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,470
Plant Pathology and the courses within

44
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,780
the concentrations can be very specific

45
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,819
like fungal genomics and as a plant

46
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,649
science student I'm able to take courses

47
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,929
in other concentrations like plant

48
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,170
genetics and breeding and sustainable

49
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,540
plant production also the faculty and

50
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,310
students here at sips are supportive and

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,829
collaborative and there's many research

52
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,740
opportunities here on campus so if

53
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:10,409
you're interested in

54
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,359
science I highly encourage you to see

55
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:14,359
what sips and Cornell has to offer

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,840
this has been a production of Cornell

57
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,840
