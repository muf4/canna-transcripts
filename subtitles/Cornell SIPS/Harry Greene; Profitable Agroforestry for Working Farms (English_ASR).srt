1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,160
propagate ventures uh i guess we'll

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll dive right in first this is this

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,320
is a photo looking down a windbreak

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,879
which is also an irrigation canal

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,519
but it's it's one of our favorites uh

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,239
most

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,278
all of these photos we've taken across

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,038
different farms

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,960
in different states and countries and

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
whatnot so

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
any questions just maybe write them down

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,439
and happy to dive in there

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,279
but agenda for the day we'll go into an

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,039
overview of how we work as a business

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
that's our general pitch

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,558
um we'll we'll look at a product demo

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
or analysis snapshot will review over

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,599
yield as a concept so how

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,919
trees and crops together are more

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,879
productive than managing them separately

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
um throw up a few agroforestry farms in

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,759
the finger lakes and then we'll look at

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
what's been recently introducing

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,878
and what's upcoming

27
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,840
so ag and farming

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,000
get a whole lot of attention in the news

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,079
in the climate change discussion um and

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
they've really become a focal point

31
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,478
and so often we see images like this um

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
this is actually

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:23,118
former amazon or amazon land um

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
and we want to move this at least to the

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,519
onset

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
towards something more like this so

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,399
agroforestry

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
um it's a super old concept it's kind of

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,359
weed and popular serious just a current

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
iteration of that

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,359
and it's it's known to be about

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
40 times excuse me 40 percent more

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,879
productive

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,319
than i guess traditional agriculture

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,399
and we'll dive into how that works in a

46
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,039
little bit uh but

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,759
say if agroforestry were incorporated

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,360
onto a fraction of u.s farmland

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,359
that the carbon data looks like

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,079
those is offsetting about 10

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,118
of annual emissions u.s annual emissions

52
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,560
every year

53
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,199
and with returns at or below far

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
five percent uh farmers are looking for

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,119
alternatives

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,239
like apples chestnuts and timber

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,879
but it's it's not necessarily easy

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,239
to add tree crops to farmland because

59
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,399
there are operational

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
business and financial challenges in the

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
way

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
and what we've chosen to do is address

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,919
these obstacles which

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,039
it really unlocks farmland ag

65
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,079
productivity

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,759
and investment potential um for third

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,040
parties looking to invest

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,919
in reject

69
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,598
and specifically agriculture and this so

70
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,759
this is really what angellist did for

71
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,399
startups and wonder capital did for

72
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,159
solar

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,039
um if y'all are looking for some analogs

74
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,439
to our business model

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,639
all right so i guess uh i can i can walk

76
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,158
you through how

77
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:05,039
um we look at farms um

78
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,799
this is a design for about 200 acres of

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,799
chestnuts and elderberry

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,200
and hardwood timber in tennessee um

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,000
and what makes it unique

82
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,759
we're not investing in just not just

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,318
forestry or just kind of

84
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,158
um r d as an end into itself but

85
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,079
actually owning trees

86
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:30,318
on land along

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
ride commercial fans accepting trees

88
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,079
from the land itself as

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,439
bankable assets so to walk you through

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,080
how we do it

91
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,759
it starts with de-risking farms so folks

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,959
apply and run through an analysis

93
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,759
process

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:48,640
and who could ever

95
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,079
within a context of how a farm operates

96
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,000
so we use the holistic management

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
framework from the savory institute

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,719
uh to look at you know what is what do a

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
set of land managers want out of their

100
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,759
lives

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,878
and land and from there we look into

102
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,560
costs revenues yields

103
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,719
and labor assumptions so just a few

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
slides on those we use financial metrics

105
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,080
like

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,080
npv

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
value internal rate of return et cetera

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,879
kind of traditional financial analysis

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,280
to really just elucidate how

110
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,918
um agroforestry adds financial value to

111
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,478
the land

112
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:31,839
so revenue for different crops

113
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:34,959
labor something interested in um

114
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,478
it's not just how much how many dollars

115
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,519
it takes to manage the system but how

116
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,360
many people

117
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,399
is it going to take to operationalize

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
that farm

119
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,478
um if it's say 20 people for an for an

120
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,039
apple orchard

121
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,039
um that could flip down to one or two

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,360
people if it's a timber system

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
so context alignment there we qualify

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
projects and then group to

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
group them into funds which are

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
diversified across crop types

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,079
and geographies so

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,519
funds cohorts that de-risk each other

129
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,478
and once farms are qualified

130
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,279
connect them with investors and

131
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,918
commercial

132
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,038
buyers which is a key part of getting

133
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,680
all of these

134
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,319
fruit nut and timber crops to market and

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,759
then

136
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,680
profit share partnership between farmers

137
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,680
land managers and investors

138
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,879
and then this this is our uh this is our

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160
team up until very recently we actually

140
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,478
have audrey on the call

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
as well uh she's our new director of

142
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,439
business development and then we'll

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,399
have three more people um so up to a

144
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,600
team of seven

145
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,599
joining us by february

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,240
and so just uh succinctly um

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
recap that agroforestry econ data

148
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,918
analytics

149
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,918
project development tools so brokering

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
needs and trees needed to meet

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,319
investment expectations

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
um de-risking tree crops and connecting

153
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
land managers to financing to scale

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,839
agroforestry into a cornerstone of

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,039
agriculture

156
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,159
so i'm going to switch applications now

157
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,918
just jump into a snapshot so

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
here's a farm in hudson new york it's

159
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,719
about four hours from

160
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,240
ithaca or three and a half or four it's

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,120
on 120 acres total 50 acres open this is

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
mostly a chestnut and black currant

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,160
combo polyculture

164
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,638
uh so zoom in here

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,759
um orange rows or chestnuts purple rose

166
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
or black current

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,038
everything else are things like black

168
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,038
locust curly poplar

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,240
or biodiversity um see if the graphs

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,280
load if they don't um

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000
i guess we can imagine them no i guess

172
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,318
google is uh slowing down how fast they

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
push

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,560
graphs to um

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
to notion and other external um programs

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,079
but we'll go through

177
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
total capital required to bring a system

178
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,439
to break even

179
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,198
uh cumulative earnings internal rate of

180
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,079
return and pv which we'll work through

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
later

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,318
um cash flows

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,319
uh the discount rate that we use for the

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,400
npv full-time land manager so how many

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
full-time equivalent positions how many

186
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,038
jobs

187
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,800
a certain project is going to create we

188
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,918
actually just did an analysis

189
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,439
for an organization down in pennsylvania

190
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,159
that's looking at water quality and what

191
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,038
would

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,880
scaling profitable agroforestry based

193
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,399
riparian buffers look like

194
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,120
um and that the number of jobs that um

195
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,719
scaled up just riparian management and

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,038
say elderberry processing would create

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,599
was was super interesting to dive into

198
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,560
um this site was fallow for four years

199
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
so we

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
moonscaped it once um and then planted

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,960
cover crop just to

202
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
kick back the sycamore and the goldenrod

203
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,198
and whatnot

204
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,800
um row mulched everything

205
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,120
um with hardwood bark and so

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
it's all organic protocol um we're

207
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,399
pretty keen on

208
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,959
the uptick in in price from organic

209
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,679
products

210
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,399
and whatnot um and then another thing

211
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
we're doing

212
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:23,359
is using raked hay as

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,800
as mulch so growing in situ biomass um

214
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,919
and i think with that we should

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,000
jump back into um

216
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:37,038
the keynote we can return to all those

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,679
um other concepts in a while or

218
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,759
in a little bit maybe in the q a um so

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,239
back to over yield as a concept

220
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,399
um it's really one of our favorite words

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,879
uh to describe because

222
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,559
how do you have over yield that's it's

223
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,519
um

224
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,559
it's a good one so the 140 percent

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,159
statistic

226
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,399
um it's kind of

227
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,199
uh razor so we're going to done what

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
that means

229
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,720
plantation forestry on the left so

230
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,838
that's just trees

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,959
grain base tag on the right just grain

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
both canopies are

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
d um what we want to do is take

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
advantage of the vertical space with

235
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,399
agroforestry

236
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
so here if they're just harvested alone

237
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
um on the left that's a

238
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
popular plantation i visited in oregon

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,958
it was about 17 000 acres

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,440
of just wood and these these figures are

241
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,719
just

242
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,440
um for t

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,920
today's purposes if an acre of wood

244
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,490
yields 100 units of wood

245
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,199
and an acre of wheat yields 100 units

246
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:48,000
[Music]

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,560
200 units total but with the combination

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,559
you get less wood and less wheat or less

249
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,639
understory crop per acre

250
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,439
but together says 140 units total

251
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,838
and at the bottom of the left column

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,240
it's

253
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
it's a it's a greater yield per acre in

254
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
total so

255
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,078
two acres whereas you have 200 units

256
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
here you get

257
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,838
280 units here um so 140

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
over yield

259
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,320
examples of this um they're really

260
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,879
tangible for folks uh

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
polonia so empress polonie tomatosa and

262
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,439
wheat

263
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,200
and i guess other other understory grain

264
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,120
crops in china

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,560
um there's some really good data

266
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,399
oh pulling um a few data points or

267
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,639
talking points out of that

268
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,200
with rows of trees 130 to 160 feet apart

269
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:46,240
or so depending on the crop and the year

270
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,440
um it would it yielded 99 to 104 percent

271
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
of the control yield

272
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
so by planting trees they actually

273
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
increased crop yields between

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,320
corn wheat soy and cotton mostly with uh

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,600
wheat just because it's it's a t3

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,240
and um or plant and it's less

277
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
zero sum than corn uh which is c4 in

278
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,600
terms of sunlight

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,639
um that's at the latitude of like the

280
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
border of south and north carolina but i

281
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,399
believe it as the climate more like

282
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
missouri just because they have these

283
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,078
cold fronts that come down from siberia

284
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,399
another one of these i guess over

285
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,399
yield

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,040
common systems is silvopasture so

287
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
a combination of trees forage and

288
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,120
livestock

289
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,838
um data points here on hot days in

290
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,639
kentucky

291
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
cattle gains 60 more weight when they

292
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,039
have access to tree shade

293
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,720
or produce 20 more milk so that's a big

294
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,719
bump in production

295
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,480
there are 200 000 acres of this in the

296
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,680
north of argentina

297
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,440
i visited some of that in 2015.

298
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,159
they actually grow yerba mate there too

299
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,800
so it's kind of a

300
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,039
wood and mate or wood and cattle

301
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,159
situation they also have the

302
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,639
the mono crops of all those um the bump

303
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,360
in yield from the trees

304
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,720
um not the bump so the increased

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,800
economic returns from

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,720
trees at wider spacing arises because

307
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,159
when you have trees really close

308
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
together they grow up

309
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,679
as kind of spindly pulpwood thin logs

310
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,680
that you can't really mill into any

311
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,679
economically meaningful amount of lumber

312
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,679
but when the trees have more space you

313
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,278
get fatter logs and

314
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,879
you go from producing pulp wood to

315
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:40,000
producing saw logs

316
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:43,439
um so it's not just

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
over yield of ag products it's over

318
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
yield of

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,480
income um and how do we communicate

320
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,519
that over yield of income over

321
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
the 30 plus years that an agroforestry

322
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,879
system

323
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,879
is going to be

324
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,799
a working farm and we touched a little

325
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,639
on a little bit a bit of that in a

326
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,000
snapshot

327
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,720
but what we use is modern financial

328
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,919
analysis

329
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,920
to value tree crops um

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,200
and so if i guess

331
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,719
these are these are the main

332
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,320
topics titles there's a slide on each

333
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,560
um the time value of money

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,920
we have to ask what is so

335
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,838
what dollars is worth to us today

336
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,519
versus that same hundred dollars

337
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,040
received to us in ten years

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,600
is different because now

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,278
it's available for use so it's kind of

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
it works into the opportunity cost of

341
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,078
having or not having

342
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,958
dollars in value um and with the time

343
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,000
value of money

344
00:13:52,958 --> 00:14:00,399
we can express say in 20 20 dollars

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,720
in a dollar a day what is it worth to us

346
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,799
if we were to earn a hundred dollars in

347
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,199
2030 or if we earn 10

348
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,120
every year between now and 2030 what is

349
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,399
that worth to us in today's dollars and

350
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,440
when valuing tree crops that's something

351
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:19,519
that is totally imperative um

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,880
to communicate their value so if we add

353
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:27,839
all of those net income

354
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,838
we'll say bottom of the of the

355
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,880
spreadsheet uh add up all of their their

356
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
present values that's the net present

357
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,439
value of the system

358
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
um if we were to borrow money from the

359
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,199
bank

360
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:47,440
to let's say uh

361
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,240
opera operational expenditures of a

362
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
system

363
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
um the internal rate of return is the

364
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,799
interest rate

365
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
that the bank would have to charge to

366
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,319
eat up all of our profits

367
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
so happy to explain more of that um in

368
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
the q a if need be

369
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,958
but it's the the greater the irr the

370
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
better um

371
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,078
and this this sort of analysis

372
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,599
what was i guess not surprising but kind

373
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,519
of reassuring to us

374
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
is that it's applicable across

375
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,759
socioeconomic groups

376
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,278
even for say subsistence farmers um who

377
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,480
are growing food because it's

378
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,799
it might not be return on it might

379
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
not be dollar return on the time but it

380
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,399
might be sick caloric return on time

381
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,399
um and all of this kind of discounting

382
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,198
process is applicable and to any

383
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,278
sort of yield be that pounds calories

384
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,958
dollars nutrients etc

385
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,159
so just a few more examples of over

386
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,439
yields this is a poplar silvopasture

387
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,439
system that i got to visit

388
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,720
in argentine patagonia a few years ago

389
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,720
it's it they're in a wood scarce place

390
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,199
so it makes sense for them to grow

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
that just run-of-the-mill

392
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,159
type of timber and then argentina is a

393
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,920
big beef producing country so cattle in

394
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,559
the understory this one's in

395
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,838
it's kind of like uh northern new mexico

396
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,679
the climate there here's some

397
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
chestnut silver pasture in eastern

398
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,519
kentucky they're just really using the

399
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,479
cattle as lawn mowers

400
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,879
chestnuts are the main value crop there

401
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,360
and just takeaways here

402
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,759
feel free to screenshot this if you want

403
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
um

404
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,679
just to succinctly

405
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,919
review kind of what we've we've just

406
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,638
gone gone through um

407
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,439
both the trees and the understory have

408
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240
to

409
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
create positive economic returns for

410
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,039
over yield to occur

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,799
um clarifying on that

412
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,039
saying that we can grow something in the

413
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,838
understory is is

414
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,000
say excuse me that we can combine a

415
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,600
treat over story with an understory

416
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,759
is much more relevant when

417
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
the trees and the understory are both

418
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
profitable

419
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
in a way that aligns with the context of

420
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,919
the land manager

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,119
and how we've chosen to operate in this

422
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,400
department

423
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,399
is just to make tree crop agronomy

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
as agronomy for annual grains and

425
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
livestock production is so we're

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,798
spurring familiarity in order to make

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,919
trees a bankable asset

428
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:32,079
i'm just gonna take a breather here have

429
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:36,080
some hydration

430
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:39,359
so um i actually live up in trumansburg

431
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,558
um so for a lot of folks on

432
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,639
the webinar today um that's

433
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,639
super close to them it's about 12 miles

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
north of ithaca

435
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,440
i actually moved to this region to the

436
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
finger lakes because of the presence of

437
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,320
agroforestry

438
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
that's already here so a few farms that

439
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,918
are doing it really

440
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,839
well the finger lake cider house you can

441
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,799
see apples and asparagus here

442
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,798
um it's a

443
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,639
we'll say it's a it's it's

444
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
one of the most beautiful agroforestry

445
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,440
sites in temperate climate north america

446
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,639
that's masquerading as a cider house so

447
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
if you haven't been up there

448
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,720
uh highly recommended go walk around

449
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:26,079
have some cider and food

450
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,640
peaches in the summer pick your own

451
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,359
they do thanksgiving turkeys so the the

452
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,400
turkeys actually

453
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,079
decrease pest damage from asparagus

454
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
beetle to an economically meaningful

455
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,759
extent

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,919
and decrease the pest load um

457
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:45,038
from uh on on the peaches on the fruit

458
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
so it's not just

459
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,440
uh selling meat but actually making the

460
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,759
fruit system work a whole lot more

461
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,798
um you pick strawberries you can see the

462
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,640
turkeys and

463
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,558
the apples in the background another one

464
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
is well wellspring forest farm so steve

465
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,519
and liz gabriel

466
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:04,480
um what they've done is is

467
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,038
super interesting how they thin kind of

468
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,279
existing

469
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,000
early successional forest feeding things

470
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,960
like honeysuckle and buckthorn to sheep

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
and then actually

472
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,558
getting more in what was uh undervalued

473
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,079
kind of shrubland they also do shiitake

474
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,798
mushrooms and ducks

475
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,639
um and then this is actually underneath

476
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,119
a maple canopy you can see the tubing in

477
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,120
the background

478
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,720
then thirdly angus and fauna ripken's

479
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
glenn uh this is black locust black

480
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
walnut silver pasture brett chedzoy was

481
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,759
a peace corps

482
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,799
volunteer i believe in the early 90s

483
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:46,640
um or maybe

484
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,599
he came back and on his family's former

485
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
dairy farm

486
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,918
planted silver pasture because saw that

487
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,720
saw silva pasture in argentina and now

488
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,840
has

489
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:01,279
a hundred head of cattle on 300 acres

490
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:04,879
um he's also converting

491
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,678
uh existing forest into silvopasture

492
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
doing it really well so maintaining the

493
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,960
health of the trees so not

494
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,600
set stocking and trampoline the roots

495
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,159
um and it's a really beautiful landscape

496
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,119
uh

497
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,159
the cattle come in during hot days um

498
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,599
and eat

499
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,919
everything in the understory um

500
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,199
recently i'm just gonna time check okay

501
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,799
yep we're doing well

502
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,400
um what's been interesting for us

503
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,798
um saskatoon service berry

504
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,798
it's

505
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
a great tasting berry it's

506
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:50,079
less acid than blueberries uh more

507
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,918
floral flavor ripens two to four weeks

508
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,839
earlier than blueberries or currants

509
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,520
um and so for you pick purposes

510
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,759
this this farm right here is called

511
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,279
juneberry farm it's actually up in ovid

512
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,679
they also do pick your own so if you're

513
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,720
in the area highly recommended um

514
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,280
guy his name is he's a great guy

515
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,880
to go and hang out with as well um so

516
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,798
service very what's interesting

517
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
you can use the same mechanical

518
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,558
harvester for

519
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
blackcurrant serviceberry aronia maybe

520
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,558
beach plum

521
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,519
and whatnot so basically staggering the

522
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,480
harvest and

523
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,839
um better distributing that capital

524
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,640
expenditure

525
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,240
over different crops in different times

526
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
another one um

527
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,599
actually connected with larry smart of

528
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
cornell

529
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,558
on this front biomass willow kind of

530
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:44,158
with the cost of petroleum

531
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:47,119
as being a substitute right now

532
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
it's not often profitable um to grow

533
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,079
willow for

534
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,879
chips and then burn it for energy but

535
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,798
feeding

536
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,559
that willow to cattle um can actually

537
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,798
offset hay costs has a

538
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,798
reasonable lower maintenance return

539
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,079
especially for riparian zones

540
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,158
so riparian are kind of low-lying

541
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,519
um saturated soil that would otherwise

542
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,440
get pugged

543
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,319
pugging is when kind of cows punch

544
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,320
through the soil with their hooves

545
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,639
um so if fill the wet spots with willow

546
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,678
have the cattle eat it

547
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,840
in say the late fall or winter

548
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
uh as in say

549
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,200
that thaw cycle so it's harder to do

550
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,959
winter grazing cattle can't use their

551
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,159
horns or their nose or their hooves to

552
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,798
brush off the snow um like they can in

553
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
montana or something like that so having

554
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,000
that

555
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,798
biomass that food above ground is is a

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
great substitute for hay

557
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,400
what's upcoming and interesting for us

558
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
are i'll give two examples of this so i

559
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,559
guess two

560
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:01,038
three things here um c buckthorn

561
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,720
it's a nutraceutical super potent um

562
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,640
yeah there are three million acres of it

563
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,079
across um

564
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,440
rus so siberia mongolia china

565
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,759
we're curious in how to best mechanize

566
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,679
it

567
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,440
and what the returns are for growing it

568
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,798
in this climate or kind of

569
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,279
over into wisconsin and minnesota

570
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,319
another thing that's upcoming is looking

571
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,200
at across

572
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,000
latitudes and geographies what's the

573
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,960
optimal number of acres of silvopasture

574
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,240
that a farm

575
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,360
would do well to plant so uh

576
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,079
how many how how many hot days are there

577
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,119
so how many days

578
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:42,879
over a certain heat index that's one

579
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,879
input cell we'll say and then how

580
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,079
the herd how many animal units how much

581
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,720
dry matter do they need

582
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,158
on those hot days and then forge species

583
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,319
in the understory cool versus warm

584
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,919
season grasses c3 c4

585
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,879
um and so how do we make the data sets

586
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,559
from different

587
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,640
latitudes and places talk um to forecast

588
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,480
optimal number of acres in silver

589
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
pasture same deal with wind breaks

590
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,319
there's another photo from argentina on

591
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
the left um

592
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,639
just uh i mean it's it's a photo of me

593
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,278
but if you look at the background

594
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,520
of these farms these windbreak systems

595
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,400
it's it's pretty impressive um so the

596
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,069
questions that we want to answer are

597
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,240
how often are

598
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:31,519
[Music]

599
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,720
wind up how much weight gain how much

600
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,158
weight loss do we have and then what are

601
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,079
the costs in the revenues of

602
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,679
managing a windbreak over 30 years and

603
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,519
we're coming up on time

604
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,798
um so just takeaways agroforestry

605
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,679
creates over yields

606
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,599
um uses time value money to elucidate

607
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,679
the financial value of perennial ag

608
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,798
and then de-risking trees creates trees

609
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,360
as a bankable asset

610
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,038
so um hopefully we didn't go over too

611
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,959
much but

612
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,158
yeah that's that's the scoop um

613
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,400
hopefully we have some

614
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:04,480
some time for q a

615
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,919
so um i will ask anyone in the audience

616
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,480
if they have questions for harry

617
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,360
and if people would prefer they can

618
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
certainly put

619
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,839
their questions in the chat box

620
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,120
and yep harry you did just what i was

621
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,879
about to ask

622
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,519
um which is getting off the shared

623
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,760
screen

624
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:31,359
so questions from anyone in the audience

625
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,879
markets or some of these crops in the

626
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:37,519
northeast yeah um

627
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,640
so holes from michael snow um

628
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,759
markets for some of these crops we'll

629
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
say

630
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,119
chestnuts there's a lot of demand from

631
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,159
recent immigrants so

632
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,119
um koreans palestinians chinese etc more

633
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
in the urban areas

634
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,319
um selling retail prices drastic differ

635
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,319
pretty drastically

636
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,879
um black currant is really an ingredient

637
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,399
fruit americans aren't super familiar

638
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,278
with it

639
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,519
so i mean in in terms of black currant

640
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,558
in a product that has the similar

641
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,200
quality of minute made

642
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,759
um we you think have things like grape

643
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,919
juice but say black currant in

644
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,079
beer wine etc that's a bit more

645
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,200
interesting

646
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,199
and then black locust decking

647
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
is a substitute for the synthetic

648
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,840
decking

649
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,278
uh so first lasts for

650
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,038
20 years if you want black locust

651
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,319
decking right now most of it's imported

652
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,720
actually from europe

653
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:40,960
um so processing are existing processors

654
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,600
for a lot of things like

655
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,440
oh we'll say off-season apple

656
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,359
infrastructure for juicing different

657
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,080
fruits that fruit earlier in the year

658
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,759
um juicing fermenting refrigerating

659
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:57,199
transporting um

660
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,599
we like to look at rented space

661
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,038
and not spending more on newer capital

662
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:05,199
expenditures that are necessary

663
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,720
there's actually a black locust mill in

664
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
ithaca newfield

665
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,319
uh black locust lumber i believe it's

666
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,079
called but

667
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,359
we model everything for different

668
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,839
regions with

669
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,199
a custom sawyer coming on process coming

670
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,759
on farm

671
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,519
um so yeah

672
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,359
how small is the minimum land for an

673
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,480
agroforestry project

674
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:31,199
um say if a farmer wanted to beef up the

675
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,240
riparian buffers on his or her farm

676
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,480
from 30 feet to 100 feet wide and

677
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,159
convert it to agroforestry to maintain

678
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,319
economic return

679
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,760
um minimum land for an agroforestry

680
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,439
project um

681
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,200
totally depends on the crop type so like

682
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,640
one acre of blueberry you

683
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,519
pick would totally work out

684
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,759
um if we define agroforestry as just

685
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,599
diversifying with perennials

686
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,679
um it scales up and scales down really

687
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,000
well uh we

688
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,840
oh the smallest farm we're working on is

689
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,839
30 acres of growing space

690
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:13,278
yeah i mean converting buffer um

691
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:16,480
and agro4 is is pretty reasonable

692
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,000
it's it's just the cost of taking land

693
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,200
out of production and like say if you

694
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
have to buy hay

695
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,038
next question what is the highest number

696
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,960
of crop species you use in an

697
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,079
agroforestry system

698
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,679
um it looks like there's only one

699
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,278
species and some of the some of the

700
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,640
systems

701
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,480
association rotation without

702
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
complicating management too much great

703
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,278
question um so it depends if we're going

704
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,640
for

705
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,919
insect fungal plant diversity etc um

706
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,960
say every tenth row is it

707
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,720
is a row of biodiversity um

708
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,000
and then those insects can fly into

709
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,798
the um the system so we'll

710
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,359
i mean it's it what we highlight maybe

711
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,440
three

712
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,038
core economic species but the

713
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,558
biodiversity species are

714
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,319
i don't want to say unlimited but maybe

715
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,918
up to 12

716
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,759
and that's a lot of that's based on what

717
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,440
the xerxes society says

718
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,038
are are good species for a region for

719
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,278
insects

720
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,200
um do you have a general process to

721
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,200
follow in determining what species and

722
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,480
plants to put on a farm how site

723
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,720
specific do you get

724
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,839
when picking plant communities very

725
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,480
site-specific

726
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,879
uh um a lot of that has to do with

727
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,759
not just the biogeophysical climate but

728
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,120
also

729
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:38,398
the climate between the ears of

730
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,079
a set of farm managers um

731
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:41,439
so what works for their lifestyle and

732
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,720
their land and their current system and

733
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,399
what they want to manage

734
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
um so there's a there's a long process

735
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,119
of holistic context development there

736
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,000
all right from sam speak to the

737
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,558
experience of

738
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,159
propagate finding research on

739
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,759
agroforestry systems in the northeast

740
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,640
and how an institution like cornell

741
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:03,359
could help advance agroforestry

742
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,759
um finding research on airport

743
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,558
what we do on that front is dive into a

744
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,798
lot of

745
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,240
university and ngo white papers on

746
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,558
different crops

747
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:19,759
and say read four by 75 pages

748
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:23,278
synthesize that info and make text

749
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:27,119
cornell is great for that with new crops

750
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:31,359
coming online so grad students

751
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:34,158
writing up a uh

752
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,000
there's there's one establi just top of

753
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,679
mind establishing organic flat currents

754
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,159
in maritime canada

755
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,720
it's like the more you dig the more you

756
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,320
find

757
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,839
um so definitely keep going in that

758
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,759
front

759
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,119
for mel what amount of supply is there

760
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,759
for crops like these

761
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,119
in terms of nursery presence there is an

762
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,119
elephant in the room

763
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,918
in the nursery world because a bunch of

764
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:59,278
nurseries have

765
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:03,038
frankly retired so

766
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:05,200
efficient nurseries growing

767
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,200
a lot of these crops is definitely an

768
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,000
opportunity

769
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
the nursery hustle is very real going

770
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,319
out and finding

771
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,158
different nurseries some that have

772
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,278
unique genetics aren't necessarily the

773
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,039
easiest to order for

774
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,880
from ordering trees is not like ordering

775
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,398
off of amazon

776
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,159
um is there any income generated for by

777
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,119
incorporating plant nurseries into your

778
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
systems

779
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,798
with plants that can be harvested for

780
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,240
cuttings like

781
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,319
willow and blackcurrant it's a

782
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,120
possibility um but that's not our core

783
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,918
focus

784
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,119
right now though it can be all right

785
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
from

786
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:46,158
james mentioned black walnut

787
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,480
agroforestry in missouri

788
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,159
example using multi-purpose trees to

789
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,519
offset long-term econ

790
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,159
of growing boards any other examples of

791
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,159
multi-purpose trees in the north

792
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,839
um

793
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,038
other ice if james if you could just

794
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,319
follow up on that one

795
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,798
um with just a little bit of

796
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,960
clarification there um

797
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,879
and then from peter woodbury can you

798
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
talk about examples or plans for

799
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,240
building up marketing

800
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,240
and supply chains yes definitely um

801
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,278
i'll give two examples of buyers um

802
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:28,079
brewery and supplements brand and an

803
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,880
egg brand so pastured organic raised

804
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,359
organic

805
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
egg brand wants to diversify their

806
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,240
pastures because they can't grow crops

807
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,840
but they can grow trees that the

808
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,720
chickens integrate into

809
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:44,240
and then say breeze

810
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,798
interested in buying different fruit um

811
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,919
for their beer supplements brand

812
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,720
interested in elderberry

813
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,000
so how do we create that stack paulie

814
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
stevenson

815
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,119
do you use any forestry management

816
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,399
techniques to assist in land management

817
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,959
i.e prescribed burning

818
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,798
invasive species management forestry

819
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,240
mulching is a big one so that's like a

820
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,158
wood chipper on the front of either a

821
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,278
bobcat or a bulldozer

822
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,840
um prescribed burning is

823
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,720
oh one of our farms in maryland did that

824
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,079
um

825
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,038
and we haven't done that as a company

826
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,798
yet

827
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:21,599
it is it's on it's on it's on tap

828
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,558
um we're very interested in prescribed

829
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,519
burning

830
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,038
um just as an alternative to tillage all

831
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,200
right mark phillips

832
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,599
what are good agroforestry pathways for

833
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,960
diversified organic veg farms

834
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,959
um i would say things that

835
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,319
already use the existing refrigeration

836
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,679
and processing infrastructure

837
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:45,439
so small fruit is a good one

838
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,440
if i'll put this in the chat here

839
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:54,640
can i do that to send chat to

840
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,639
everyone okay

841
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:04,000
nope uh la doret is a market garden

842
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,918
and fruit combo

843
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,759
in the south that's doing that really

844
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,440
well and then

845
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,519
not stein do you work at all with

846
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,960
agri-voltaic like incorporating solar

847
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,918
panels of livestock

848
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,760
um in the pipeline as well uh there's a

849
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,759
big

850
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,800
uh very very large solar system that has

851
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,320
sheep underneath it

852
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,480
in the southeast u.s um

853
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,919
that they they have extra land where it

854
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,358
didn't make sense to put solar panels

855
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,759
but they want to do the same thing and

856
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,319
they see

857
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
they they see that value analog between

858
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,720
solar and trees

859
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
um so yes on that if if someone's

860
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,838
grazing solar then it's it's a it's a

861
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,358
good fit to then

862
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:50,000
go from solar pasture to silvo pasture

863
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,000
um helloagriculture.com would a

864
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,878
greenhouse space be required for plant

865
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,679
nursery

866
00:34:52,878 --> 00:35:00,960
or open feed um it helps just to de-risk

867
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,078
uh weather events for sure uh

868
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,039
greenhouses are great

869
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,800
um we've seen people grow blueberries

870
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,039
and raspberries and peaches

871
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
underneath high tunnels for frost

872
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,119
protection and whatnot and just

873
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,480
season extension um so hopefully that

874
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
answered

875
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,838
that question also what about herbs and

876
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,919
medicinal

877
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,920
plants integrated in your operations is

878
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,240
that profitable um

879
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,680
if there's a market for it and the

880
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,639
processing works out

881
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,279
um and it fits with the context

882
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,639
definitely

883
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
one of the interesting ones there is

884
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,319
schisandra vine

885
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,679
i haven't modeled it yet but i would i

886
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,680
would love to um

887
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,679
herbs and medicinal plants we get a lot

888
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,880
of questions about hemp um

889
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:48,239
but as i'm sure a lot of

890
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,680
folks have seen it's it's been a big

891
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,799
boom and bust crop

892
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,838
um so we

893
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,760
we thankfully avoided getting uh

894
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,838
pulled into the cbd craze um

895
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
yeah i've been i've been i've been

896
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:04,960
talking a bunch but any any other

897
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,079
questions what

898
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,559
how are we doing on time um a few more

899
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,599
minutes

900
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,639
so if there were more questions we would

901
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,680
be able to

902
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,159
accommodate them i have a question

903
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,879
yeah thank you so much for this talk it

904
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,159
was really

905
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,240
awesome um and marvin pritz gave

906
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,679
an introduction to a lot of these

907
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,078
lesser-known berry

908
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,000
crops uh in our berry production class

909
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,519
today so it was super cool to see

910
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,039
how they're being economically

911
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,000
integrated um

912
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,559
you talked a lot about the economics of

913
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,599
um

914
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:43,920
these integrated agroforestry systems

915
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:47,119
how how does um carbon sequestration

916
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,400
kind of fit in to all this with you were

917
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,039
saying you're trying to reduce

918
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
tillage um and have you modeled any of

919
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,320
uh the carbon sequestration

920
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:01,039
and long-term uh benefits

921
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,039
yeah the um the carbon itself with trees

922
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:07,199
feels really easy to ah but so it's

923
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,679
easier to model and have an input cell

924
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:13,759
for the price of carbon but um assuring

925
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,118
what that price of carbon will be is the

926
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,079
hardest part so the

927
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:23,119
the um i wrote an article about this

928
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,640
the economic reality of

929
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,640
aggro ecology um

930
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,000
that's the title that dives into a

931
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,480
deeper version of this but

932
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,440
there are a few ways that that works out

933
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,679
really well

934
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,480
or carbon payments the way we're

935
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,960
addressing this

936
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,440
is via kind of creating those ecosystem

937
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,358
services as a positive externality

938
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,320
so just doing it anyway and the crops

939
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,559
make the econ work out the other one is

940
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:55,119
having a municipality

941
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:57,599
not a carbon market so a single buyer

942
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,838
pay for ecosystem services be those

943
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,240
carbon or water quality payments

944
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,239
the ecosystem services markets in the us

945
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,598
are generally underdeveloped

946
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,358
so we do definitely keep tabs on them um

947
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,240
but we're not necessarily holding our

948
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,239
breath right now

949
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:19,838
and one other question

950
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,719
i see from michael snow how can we find

951
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,719
equipment for

952
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:28,000
mechanizing these operations yeah

953
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,000
so um

954
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,838
for for berries in particular

955
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:42,159
that's what you want to google um it's

956
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,159
basically shrub fruit mechanization

957
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,720
another question that we always ask is

958
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:51,440
how do we model systems to use

959
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,719
readily available equipment that farmers

960
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,838
already have

961
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:59,199
to manage these systems so

962
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:02,078
we want to go out and buy another 20 000

963
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,598
piece of machinery so how do we use a

964
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,440
rotary rake

965
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,960
integrated into an agroforestry system

966
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,679
it's a basic hanging implement that

967
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,079
everyone has

968
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,838
or like a bail chopper to mulch um

969
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,599
so yeah that's that's a that's a fun

970
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,320
rabbit hole in mechanization

971
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,079
um and then from holly stevenson do you

972
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,240
ever model your systems after

973
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,960
other types of ecosystems like savannahs

974
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,959
or prairies

975
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,119
definitely on savannahs and prairies um

976
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,719
so wide silver pasture spacing kind of

977
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,119
mimics that that that

978
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:40,719
sparse tree um system and then

979
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:44,240
wide wide spacing for alley cropping

980
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,239
for grain might also mimic that

981
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,039
so harry based on the number of

982
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,519
questions that came in

983
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,480
in the chat i would say that there was a

984
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,679
great deal

985
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,960
of interest in your subject

986
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:04,159
and uh your methods and uh

987
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,880
also we had a terrific turnout today

988
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,920
uh so late in the semester so i want to

989
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,920
thank you

990
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:16,079
for sharing uh so much about

991
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:20,720
how your firm is not only working today

992
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,720
but also looking to the future

993
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,359
fantastic yeah and i guess

994
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,838
dawn and sam and catalina thank you so

995
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,519
much

996
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,400
for hosting um we really appreciate the

997
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,519
opportunity

998
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,720
uh to to come in and um

999
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,519
share what we're up to with everyone um

1000
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,078
my email is just harry

1001
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:44,960
propagateventures.com

1002
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,560
um welcome anyone to follow up there or

1003
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,800
on social media or just propagate

1004
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,000
ventures on facebook and instagram

1005
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,960
um i believe this not asked

1006
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,480
if this is being recorded yes i think it

1007
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,519
will be up on youtube

1008
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,719
i'm not sure when exactly um

1009
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,719
but yeah that that'll uh

1010
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:09,199
that'll be available to go back and

1011
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,078
maybe decipher things that i've said

1012
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,279
quickly

1013
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,720
or it will be available i can't tell you

1014
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:21,200
quite how soon but it will be on

1015
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:24,959
the section of horticulture website

1016
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:28,399
so thanks again harry and um farewell

1017
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,800
