1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,199
University all right welcome to the

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,500
afternoon session so we got three talks

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,239
on vegetables coming up and so hope you

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,789
all had a good lunch it was pretty tasty

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,189
I didn't get to eat everything there

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,310
like I saw other people eating good

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:29,368
stuff so I will start off talk to myself

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:32,390
about about a couple of the things in

10
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:37,500
vegetable cover crop systems that have

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,710
been of concern that we're trying to get

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,909
the most benefit out of cover crops in

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,429
these systems so if you're thinking

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:47,128
about vegetable systems what makes them

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,280
distinct in terms of cover crops you

16
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:53,488
have the high revenue so doing good

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,439
things can really be worthwhile not

18
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:59,759
getting a crop off is really expensive

19
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,530
that as a big impact in the most

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,978
vegetable systems you're returning very

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,010
little organic matter and based on some

22
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,840
work my colleague Jay Mount Pleasant did

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,000
based on a sustainable system that was

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,530
used in western New York for about 400

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,140
years if you're doing no tillage at all

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,150
maintaining you know continuous sustain

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,950
production you need somewhere in the

28
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,810
neighborhood of 4 or 5 tons of organic

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,689
matter returned to the system just to

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,320
stay even and vegetable systems aren't

31
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:33,959
even coming close and intense tillage in

32
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,359
the next the next thing on the list here

33
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,280
so those are those are real challenges

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,129
to the system we're cover crops play a

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,989
significant role we tend to run very

36
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,310
high fertility that means that the cover

37
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:49,019
crops grow better they decompose faster

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,478
we tend to harvest the crops before

39
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,429
maturity which means that the fertility

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,109
and the soil is very high everything is

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,360
running full speed and all of a sudden

42
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,340
it stops it's not like most of the field

43
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,228
crops where you're letting the crop

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,490
mature and there's this sort of slowing

45
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:05,759
down period we don't

46
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:10,228
that in vegetables the other part is

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,639
tremendously diverse timing of when

48
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,580
things are planted when things are

49
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,488
harvested and so that means we need a

50
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,890
similar diversity in the kinds of cover

51
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:24,509
crop opportunities and tools that we

52
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:27,000
have so I think you know for for field

53
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:29,340
crops winter ride gets you about 80% of

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,800
the way there I think and with vegetable

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:37,560
systems it's maybe 20% so you need a lot

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:44,910
more possibilities and we do some nasty

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:48,719
things so here's harvest nasty yes miss

58
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,969
yeah yeah so the harvesters can be

59
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,150
fairly tough on them here we have some

60
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:55,769
some demands in terms of the surface of

61
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,680
the soil so the surface of the soil

62
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,000
it's unacceptably lumpy because that's

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,390
going to be picking up a lot of bean

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,939
sized stones and that don't separate out

65
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,649
well we're getting nice transfer of soil

66
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,909
borne pathogens to the beans they need

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,590
to be held up higher so you we have some

68
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:16,739
unusual requirements this one is solved

69
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,099
by rolling to crush all the nice soil

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,280
aggregates we can have a substantial

71
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,870
amount of fall traffic so corn harvester

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,870
moves a lot of stuff but that's nothing

73
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:34,620
compared to 50 tons an acre of cabbage

74
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:39,030
well I I intend I intend to ignore that

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,430
warning yeah doesn't apply to me so if

76
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,318
you're if you're taking off 50 tons per

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,780
acre of stuff in the fall when the

78
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,988
ground is wet you're creating some

79
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:55,009
challenges that can be avoided in some

80
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:58,530
other crops so yeah so some of the

81
00:03:55,009 --> 00:04:00,840
questions is what what should one do

82
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,280
looking at the Cornell soil health test

83
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,909
which reflects all of these challenges

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,050
that you have in the vegetable systems

85
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:09,900
to try to improve things

86
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,260
the kind of the context of how I've been

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,730
thinking about using the cover crops and

88
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,469
doing the outreach in the cover crops

89
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,389
area and so you've seen some things

90
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,410
about the soil health test so I'm not

91
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,490
going to be laboring that today but

92
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,970
basically you get a report back and

93
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,430
there we go and sometimes you get bad

94
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,640
scores that you want to improve matters

95
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:46,680
on and so we have data on how to improve

96
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:53,029
some of those and so we can get here

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,030
management goals done in terms of the

98
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:58,589
challenges that are identified by the

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:05,069
soil health tools so these are mostly

100
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:08,399
done by the different management goal so

101
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:10,259
producing a decision tool that that's

102
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:15,418
tailored to the vegetable growers that

103
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,949
has that wide array of choices of cover

104
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,859
crops that will fit the different

105
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,870
windows so this has a bunch of different

106
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,970
times when people might have the

107
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,310
opportunity to plant a cover crop the

108
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:31,260
durations because sometimes you have a

109
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:32,939
month or so sometimes you have from kind

110
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,199
of middle of summer not enough season

111
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,730
left to use it but you're not going to

112
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,680
be planting again until spring you can

113
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:46,860
have quite a lot of time and this goes

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,329
so this I put that big in case you wanna

115
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,389
use it it's easy to remember and it

116
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:58,349
works on your phone so you can use it

117
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:59,849
anywhere anytime so this is designed so

118
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,830
that you can make decisions fairly

119
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,020
quickly based on constraints of a farm

120
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,418
and so that the different

121
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:08,909
characteristics of the cover crops are

122
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:11,549
immediately apparent usually the ones

123
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,580
for deciding which cover crop might fit

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,050
and how it fits in the myriad of

125
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,668
combinations that can exist in a

126
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,340
vegetable system so

127
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,258
we have a relatively small number of

128
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:27,658
answers a relatively large number of

129
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:30,060
constraints so there's not there's not a

130
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:36,209
perfect grid to match up everything it's

131
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:39,019
a lot of judgment calls and we have I

132
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:43,258
think somewhat some of the ones that are

133
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:44,728
helpful are unavoidable problems that

134
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,860
there are there are certain things that

135
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:50,430
you just you can't get around so if this

136
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,098
is if this is an issue on your farm so

137
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,610
here for the red clover retains root rot

138
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,990
and legume

139
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,319
rotations so if you're a bean grower

140
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,939
where root rot is a huge problem there's

141
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,860
no way around that just don't use clover

142
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,990
just cross it right off the list so

143
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,169
that's an example of things where we can

144
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,319
collect information and put it into an

145
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:14,250
easily applicable tool and then avoid

146
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,199
problems so again picking on the red

147
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,329
clover it's slow to establish so you'll

148
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,879
get a nasty Reedy mess if you just plant

149
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,218
clover the solution is use a nurse crop

150
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,449
so it's a it's a problem that easily

151
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,668
arise if you don't know what you're

152
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,830
doing or you haven't tried it before but

153
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:30,269
there's a solution to that so those we

154
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,209
have a lot of things that can be added

155
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,158
added in there it's an easy place to

156
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,788
take that this kind of thing is an easy

157
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:40,438
place to add new information as you do

158
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:45,120
research and discover new ways to avoid

159
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:49,110
problems more accurate numbers here

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,800
better research support for some of the

161
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,838
management goals but I think that's a

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,689
nice tool to bring in the work that many

163
00:07:54,838 --> 00:08:03,569
people do and then I've been putting out

164
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,639
these the fact sheets on the cover crops

165
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,408
and they're designed to contain only in

166
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,658
the information that a vegetable grower

167
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:11,399
in New York would need so these are

168
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:15,348
designed specifically to be useful

169
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:19,668
useless to the Vermont vegetable grower

170
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:20,748
and that's because it's so specific that

171
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,978
if you're getting information that's

172
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:24,259
generalized

173
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:27,498
to apply to a broader area it turns out

174
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,598
not to be useful for a specific farm so

175
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,399
getting that specificity is a real

176
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,929
challenge that we have in serving the

177
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:38,538
entire grower community and so having no

178
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,370
extraneous information so we're not

179
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:43,129
learning about Maryland or Vermont we're

180
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,759
just applying to New York that's useful

181
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:49,100
for the growers so to try to tailor

182
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,289
something that specifically when I

183
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,170
developed these sexy seed sources was

184
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:56,179
important because people couldn't find

185
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:58,549
the seeds to buy or they'd be available

186
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,769
for like ten times as much as you would

187
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:04,159
expect to pay for their commercial

188
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,110
grower so thankfully that's changed it's

189
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,419
relatively easy to find reasonably

190
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,310
priced cover crop seeds these days but

191
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:12,259
that was something that's also very

192
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:17,469
local because the transportation costs

193
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:20,449
are high for a number of those so and

194
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,060
provide a couple of examples of cover

195
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:24,889
crops where we've done some research to

196
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,828
optimize their use for a particular

197
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,600
location so some of this can be

198
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:31,399
generalized you'd have to get the some

199
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,860
of the specific timing different in

200
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:40,068
different locations so we'll start with

201
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,318
buckwheat so it's a very short season

202
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:44,870
crop the reason it's useful in vegetable

203
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:46,729
rotations is that it's five weeks you

204
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,610
can have a gap of five weeks between

205
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,199
harvesting one thing and having the

206
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,389
right planting date for another so you

207
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:55,009
end up with a lot of these odds and ends

208
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,079
of parts of a field that that are

209
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,938
available for very short times and

210
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,500
buckwheat works very well for that so

211
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:03,559
that's why it's attractive for vegetable

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:08,740
growers it's been used as a weed

213
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:11,448
suppressor for a long time and our

214
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:16,100
summer climate is just right for it it's

215
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:19,909
not too hot not too cold and so we get

216
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,220
some some soil health benefits but it

217
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,679
probably the weeds are the fastest and

218
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,870
so I try to make a point of including

219
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,299
this slide in a lot of talks if you're

220
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,649
gonna have success for the cover crop

221
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:33,069
this applies to pretty much any cover

222
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:35,500
crop it has to start fast you have to

223
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,160
have no gaps in the stand and it has to

224
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,169
be killed on time so most growers can

225
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,029
figure out how to make those three

226
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,679
things happen and the answers are

227
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,689
different for every situation but if you

228
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:50,799
make those three things happen it works

229
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,470
and so with buckwheat you have a fast

230
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,709
SAR so four days Greenline at four days

231
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,930
is what one expects if one is to get

232
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,550
weed suppression so what are the

233
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,149
techniques that will get your green line

234
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:05,620
in four days not five or six so that's

235
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:07,480
it's very fast something to think about

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,029
how do you how do you do that all the

237
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,889
field preparation timing of when you

238
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,250
plants the kind of planting tools you

239
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:17,049
use planting depth all the settings you

240
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,389
also need to get by three weeks you need

241
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:21,250
to have at least 70% ground cover to

242
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,679
suppress the weeds so that's growing

243
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,809
quite quickly and then you need to kill

244
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,579
it on time five weeks buckwheat is very

245
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:30,189
nice it turns white when it's time to

246
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,990
kill it so it's relatively easy to tell

247
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,740
the difference between not ready and

248
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:40,000
ready but so that's an example of those

249
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,950
three principles and buckwheat so we

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,570
figured out something about the planting

251
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,900
window that gives us this time so this

252
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:54,730
was done with Northeast Serra funding

253
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:56,319
explicitly that we looked at different

254
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,360
planting day so we did sequential

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,190
plantings through the entire growing

256
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,289
season when we had the opportunity to do

257
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,910
it and of course the weather is

258
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:06,429
different in different days but so here

259
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:09,789
is the early growth does it grow fast

260
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:16,029
enough so here's the 70 the gray line is

261
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:17,709
70% ground cover and in the springtime

262
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,480
yeah it comes out of the ground but it

263
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,870
really grows too slowly to out-compete

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,370
the weeds so you could look and see that

265
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,620
it's there and that it's growing but

266
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,789
really to get enough growth we need to

267
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,110
be into July most of the years and

268
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:36,370
August is good and then it tails off

269
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:39,100
pretty quickly and then if you want to

270
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,789
see that the far end of the season so to

271
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,100
get enough biomass out

272
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:47,829
it really were not talking end of August

273
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,430
anymore like in the previous slide

274
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:55,790
really it's early August when that

275
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,589
window closes shut so the answer we did

276
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:59,659
is June and July is when you can plant

277
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:04,370
buckwheat and have a successful cover

278
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:06,289
crop in this region so that kind of work

279
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,830
you can develop the greedy models and

280
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:11,389
get a map of when that last planting

281
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,129
date is for different locations and so

282
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:18,439
this can inform decision tools and so

283
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,750
this number may not apply to the entire

284
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,420
area that we've mapped here but that the

285
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,940
software is so great at kicking out

286
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:28,879
information what

287
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:33,650
so what we've find is that it it's

288
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:36,379
really pretty varied geographically

289
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,679
throughout that part of the Northeast

290
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:43,429
here so that's one thing I think in an

291
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,739
earlier session today pointed out how in

292
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,229
developing the Midwest tool you can kind

293
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,610
of figure out these lines run with the

294
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,009
interstates and you've got these nice

295
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,659
broad bands of planting dates and you

296
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:57,259
come up in the Northeast and it's

297
00:13:53,659 --> 00:14:01,159
nothing like that at all and so trying

298
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:03,049
to use the same geographic concepts in

299
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:06,379
making recommendations about planting

300
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:08,629
dates you really have to change how you

301
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,669
think about it so this kind of mapping

302
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:15,289
has been helpful for thinking through

303
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:17,000
that and the climate tools that are

304
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:21,349
available are really helpful for doing

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,629
it so I'm going to talk about crucifer a

306
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,210
little bit that's an another one so

307
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,769
these are a little bit later in the

308
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,610
season than buckwheat but earlier in the

309
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:33,610
season then the winter grains and

310
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,699
so the ones that we've seen the most of

311
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:42,079
our is the tillage radish by far but

312
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,240
there's a number of different ones and

313
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,580
you can use them in different ways

314
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,560
depending on how the weather works I

315
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,670
wanted to talk about the planting date

316
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,739
issue specifically here so here we did

317
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:59,028
trials in a number of so this is

318
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,000
Michigan but the you notice how abruptly

319
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:04,039
the season ends with these it's like it

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,440
goes over a cliff at a particular date

321
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,969
right it's not some subtle slow I think

322
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,010
I can get away with waiting another week

323
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,639
kind of a thing it's when the season is

324
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:16,338
over the seasons over

325
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,580
and we did this with a number of

326
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,800
different cruciferous that vary in there

327
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,370
cold hardiness so we have things like

328
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,859
the bio drills radish which is super

329
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,528
sensitive all the way up to Athena which

330
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,980
is a winter canola which is fully winter

331
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:36,350
hardy here and so the question is do the

332
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,860
ones that are more cold hardy can you

333
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:43,430
plant them later and so if you were to

334
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,919
compare the red radish here with the

335
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:48,439
green winter canola the two extreme so

336
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,949
how much later can you go with the

337
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,060
canola than the red when the answer is

338
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,520
you can't they all have the same date

339
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:02,169
that that planting window closes which

340
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,549
was not what I expected to find at all

341
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,429
the plus of this of course is that we

342
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:10,338
can use the same degree name model for

343
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,919
all of the crucifer so that that saves

344
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:17,600
an awful lot of research when we want to

345
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:21,759
develop the corresponding map for

346
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,350
crucifer so here it's a little bit

347
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,069
simpler landscape in the fall than it

348
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:35,389
was on the buckwheat one that's a warmer

349
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:37,490
season crop so this is what the four

350
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:40,580
crucifer does look like this is taken

351
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,970
November third not this year but a few

352
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,970
years ago

353
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,299
they really function differently so you

354
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:51,129
have Tilney is a white mustard so it's

355
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,479
bolted there it's going the straw is

356
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:54,340
going to stand through the winter it's

357
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,830
gonna hold snow on the ground throughout

358
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,610
the winter so this is a location where

359
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:02,800
it's common to have snowfalls one day

360
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,900
melt a couple days later and it snows

361
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,419
again a few days later so holding the

362
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,180
snow in place is a valuable feature we

363
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,550
have a Caliente brown mustard that is

364
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:16,060
going to have just create a little mat

365
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:17,769
and not survive the winter at all the

366
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,119
canola is going to live it's going to

367
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,000
look pretty much like that all winter

368
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,938
it's not going to turn brown or anything

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,410
and the radish will melt away entirely

370
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:34,509
fairly quickly but it's a great biomass

371
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,009
producer so that winter behavior is

372
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:38,109
important so that's an area where

373
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,509
there's still quite a bit to learn how

374
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:42,549
to use the crucifer x' in just the right

375
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:44,019
way and so we've had quite a bit of

376
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,149
experience with the radish but we don't

377
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:49,359
expect the radish to survive at all here

378
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,490
and the goal with these is either said

379
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,250
they should be all dead it should be

380
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,839
completely alive so in between is not

381
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,839
good and it's because they vary in

382
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,309
winter hardiness from variety to variety

383
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,189
you have to match the variety to the

384
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:07,599
location and you have to vary that or

385
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,850
adjust for the growth stage too so so if

386
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,349
you have really tiny plants if you plant

387
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:13,240
late and they just come up and you're

388
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:16,750
you're counting on their growth to come

389
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,329
in the spring time for instance they're

390
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,130
gonna frost teeth it's just with the

391
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,539
freezing and thawing they'll push right

392
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,910
out of the ground but if they're a

393
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,950
little bit bigger so that they now make

394
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,900
a rosette then they're at their maximum

395
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,779
winter hardiness so those are going to

396
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,280
survive so it could be that you're

397
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,259
growing something like canola that makes

398
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,109
a rosette or it could be that you have

399
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:39,789
some runty plants in the in the planting

400
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:41,889
that that only came up and made a

401
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:45,480
rosette where everything else bolted

402
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:50,410
well those little ones are going to be

403
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:53,230
surviving and then the the voltage so if

404
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,360
you have a stem or a bulb with like a

405
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,120
radish or a turnip those are going to

406
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,399
freeze the other parts of the plant

407
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,379
are the roots and the leaves they

408
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,880
survive much better through the winter

409
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,530
so if you're trying to carryover

410
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,390
nitrogen for instance those nitrogen

411
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,500
containing parts are going to be

412
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:16,410
surviving so we're getting that that

413
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:18,089
match is going to take some tailoring I

414
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,110
think of a fair bit of education

415
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,869
opportunity a fair bit of research

416
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:25,649
opportunity to find what's going to work

417
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:27,329
the best so what we found with the

418
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,190
crucifer so it's about a two-week window

419
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:31,199
it's an artist in New York it moves

420
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,299
around in other places but it's only

421
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,240
about a two-week window so it's fairly

422
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,178
short of course with vegetables a lot of

423
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,539
crucifer vegetables not just the cabbage

424
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,269
that Chris mark showed off that it's

425
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,829
grown quite a lot but the leafy crucifer

426
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:51,389
czar very popular on vegetable farms

427
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:55,079
broccoli I predict will be expanding

428
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,000
over the next few years so you can't

429
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,769
have crucifer cover crops and crucifer

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,319
cash crops in the same rotation if

431
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:04,440
they're an important part of your

432
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:06,299
program the winter killed ones are great

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,558
for allowing early access in the spring

434
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,730
and they have tremendous weed

435
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,569
suppression so you end up with

436
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:17,400
essentially no went cool season weeds in

437
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:19,169
the springtime if you grow them

438
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,280
differently so that there is residue in

439
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,870
the spring they have the potential to

440
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,700
carryover nitrogen and that's why we

441
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:30,959
haven't solved how to get that to work

442
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,299
yet as far as I can tell that actually

443
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,420
having the nitrogen still there after

444
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,009
the soil has been saturated in the

445
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,110
springtime is a challenge so it really

446
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:43,109
needs to be green parts that are going

447
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,839
to decompose after the ground begins to

448
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,639
warm up so it's it's going to be a trick

449
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,419
to get all that recovered but there's a

450
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:56,670
huge opportunity they take up massive

451
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:59,490
amounts of nitrogen so for crucifer

452
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,320
crops they support soil borne diseases

453
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,759
but for other crops they're actually

454
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:08,569
very good at suppressing soil borne

455
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:10,910
diseases and but they're very particular

456
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:12,919
and that I think there's probably an

457
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,930
overemphasis on the bio fumigation

458
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,060
concept there's a lot more going on than

459
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:22,970
that and sometimes there's not that

460
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:26,119
going on at all I work with some growers

461
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,940
and extension folks in California where

462
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,489
they're their big cash crop is lettuce

463
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,309
and they have a bottom rottenness the

464
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,069
disease their broccoli is a fantastic

465
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:40,960
suppressor of bottom rot works great

466
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:44,539
cauliflower useless utterly useless I

467
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,039
think they'd be pretty similar bio a

468
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:49,129
fumigant mustard you think they'd be

469
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:53,990
great useless completely useless for

470
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,250
suppressing that disease so no they grow

471
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,859
it lettuce and broccoli solves their

472
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,559
problem but so how do we use the

473
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,629
crucifer effectively targeted for the

474
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,279
specific diseases and finding the

475
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:13,250
varieties and types that will actually

476
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:17,869
do a very good job for us there so so

477
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:20,690
here's an experiment where we tried to

478
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:23,919
really identify the effects on a number

479
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,509
of different soil health parameters and

480
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,980
what aggregate stability is the one I'm

481
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,809
going to show you but the story was the

482
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,890
same for all of them so we wanted to

483
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:35,480
show in the vegetable hi tillage low

484
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,480
organic matter return system what would

485
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,690
these different cover crops do for the

486
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,309
soil health parameters and we knew that

487
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,650
we couldn't detect anything over a

488
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,259
one-year period so we used the same

489
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,390
cover crop four years in a row on these

490
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,670
plots we had different vegetables each

491
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,230
year so the wrote vegetables rotated but

492
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,610
the cover crop was the same so you

493
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,710
wouldn't necessarily want to do that on

494
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:59,929
the farm but we wanted to do that to

495
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,940
really try to push the effect of that

496
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:09,350
and pick up what the different ones did

497
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:12,110
and so we had midsummer ones and then

498
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:13,969
later summer ones and so here's ones

499
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:16,699
that would be used in midsummer so

500
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,620
annual ryegrass buckwheat Sudan grass

501
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,680
yellow mustard and the control is

502
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:22,229
leaving it

503
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,670
during the non cropping part of the

504
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,950
season we had a couple of different

505
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,680
fields and so what you want to compare

506
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,200
is how much did the wet aggregate

507
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:36,060
stability improve after four years

508
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:40,380
relative to the bare ground and the

509
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:43,289
answer is you didn't see it move yet and

510
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,570
so then if you look at the winter ones

511
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,549
or the late summer planted one so annual

512
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:49,710
ryegrass ryan tree to Cayley you have

513
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,480
live roots all winter long until the

514
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,940
springtime so you might expect a larger

515
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,519
effect from those than from radish

516
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,460
turnip and mustard that died but again

517
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:03,799
you compare after four years of these

518
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,799
cover crops relative to the bare ground

519
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,579
we're gonna have to make those error

520
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,889
bars a whole lot smaller we're going to

521
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,019
detect anything right so the effect is

522
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,430
small so we've got this high tillage

523
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:19,769
system that we're really beating up the

524
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,700
wet aggregate stability with all the

525
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:26,069
other operations we do so in this case

526
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,620
taking that system and only adding the

527
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:30,119
cover crop is not enough to move the

528
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,339
needle and I think that's something that

529
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:36,449
we're going to see in these intensely

530
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:38,220
managed systems that it takes a lot more

531
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,200
integration of different management

532
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,660
practices if we're going to move the

533
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,350
needle on some of the soil health

534
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,350
parameters

535
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,379
so intense tillage very hard to

536
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,269
counteract if with just cover crops it

537
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:02,710
takes more than that so reducing tillage

538
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:06,389
is important I think of the soil health

539
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,640
test is being a good way to identify

540
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:13,210
constraints you may not be able to make

541
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,060
those constraints go away at all or just

542
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,950
using cover crops so some of them you

543
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:20,139
just have to learn to deal with that as

544
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,819
an issue on that particular farm or

545
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,420
field that that's going to be a

546
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:28,139
limitation and so avoiding having it get

547
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,810
worse may be the best that can be done

548
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:34,360
for some of those so the changing the

549
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:36,339
management they those many of those

550
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:39,579
measured parameters changed quite slowly

551
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:42,579
so where people are accustomed to doing

552
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,769
a soil test for the chemical nutrients

553
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:46,740
and you add more and then you see next

554
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:50,589
year that those numbers have gone up

555
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,180
that works fine for chemicals for soil

556
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:55,809
health parameters they're likely to move

557
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,210
more slowly so not not getting antsy

558
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,559
worrying oh I I did this treatment in

559
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,019
that treatment and this year I did my

560
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,899
soil health test and it didn't change in

561
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:09,639
the way I expected it to well we will

562
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:12,430
hear that yeah so giving the limitations

563
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,590
continued attention and cover crops is

564
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,640
part of that story it has to be part of

565
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:21,959
a larger context of how the vegetables

566
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,370
are grown so that's my last slide so

567
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:31,220
thanks very much yeah

568
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:34,199
[Applause]

569
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:44,210
come on glass slide so what looking

570
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:54,000
forward what do you think village right

571
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:55,950
yes we're doing it but not sure is

572
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,890
I know intuitively it's a good thing but

573
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:05,690
much danger I'm curious if any work on

574
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:08,070
eternal investment to buy it right so

575
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,700
yeah reducing the tillage I think that's

576
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:15,539
that's an area where we're we the

577
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,240
community not me my lab are looking very

578
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:21,779
much and and for cover crops that that

579
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,670
help you reduce tillage so you the cover

580
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,230
crop is doing some of the things that

581
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:29,730
the tillage tools did and think of the

582
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:33,630
cover crops in that ways so with with

583
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:37,019
the zone tiller system you could combine

584
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:40,350
that with where you plant something like

585
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:42,450
the radish in the planting row so that

586
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:45,779
that will work up much more easily and

587
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:49,620
then of us winter hardy cover crop in

588
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:54,149
between the roads so so strip tilling is

589
00:27:49,619 --> 00:28:00,439
a an opportunity I think the our GPS

590
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:03,929
guidance has enormous potential to allow

591
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,690
tillage only of the area you need for a

592
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:08,580
lot of our crops we need the the good

593
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,880
seed bed needs to be about like that

594
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:14,819
right that'll do it and if you have

595
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,610
porous soil elsewhere you don't need to

596
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,740
actually till that so that's what we

597
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:22,529
need but we're actually doing this much

598
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,740
for each row that's that's overkill size

599
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:27,389
I see some opportunities there and the

600
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,900
growers who are doing that continually

601
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:33,670
year after year finding easier access to

602
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,620
the field for harvest and planting

603
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,300
a whole bunch of other good soil health

604
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:39,569
benefits derived from that that really

605
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,569
pale

606
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,220
yeah

607
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,439
[Music]

608
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,290
yeah

609
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:06,529
yeah we did a lot of that too there

610
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,380
there is about a one week or so window

611
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:11,990
and it seems to work but it's different

612
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,730
by that window will fall somewhere in

613
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,529
about a six week window but you don't

614
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:20,380
know in advance which one it's going to

615
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:25,460
be and I don't like that kind of tools

616
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:28,580
so are the the publication isn't out yet

617
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,590
but the answer is going to be this is

618
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:32,589
probably not going to work out very well

619
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:47,540
yeah so the I've done most of my work on

620
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:50,919
this in Geneva some and if it got in

621
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:54,829
Michigan in Geneva there is a lot of

622
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:58,700
cabbage productions so we had really

623
00:29:54,829 --> 00:30:02,599
intense free beetle pressure in the fall

624
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,600
it hasn't been an issue at all in with

625
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:08,779
overwintering crucifer x' they they

626
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:13,428
flower in April and early May and so the

627
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:14,960
flea beetles are not out yet so with

628
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,669
both of those we've avoided the flea

629
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,289
beetle season but that's come come June

630
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:23,290
they'll be foliate the entire plant

631
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:30,190
right right right

632
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:46,720
right yeah yeah my time so yeah it yeah

633
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,339
it depends on the timing of the flea

634
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,480
beetle populations in those locations I

635
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:54,250
think in a lot of locations the flea

636
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,930
beetles will be pretty much finished off

637
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:07,390
by the time the radishes are really

638
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:10,420
growing all right thanks this has been a

639
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:14,640
