00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,359
Hi everybody. This is Soul. I'm out at

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,358
my winter pee trial plots. Um, and I'm

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,519
going to do some spring raidings. I'm

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,880
doing the group of ratings that we've

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,039
timed for spring green up. And what is

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,198
spring green up? It's when you go, "Oh

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
my gosh, the world is green again." So,

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,800
that happened here about 10 days ago,

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,039
but I waited because we got a couple 20

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,039
degree nights last week and I wanted to

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,920
make sure that uh we didn't see any

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,600
further damage after that. So, I've

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
heard from some of you, especially in

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
the upper Midwest, that you had no

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,840
survival for the winter peas in your

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,759
trial. And this is a bummer. It's also

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
uh pretty common when we have open

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:58,718
winters or winters that are very cold

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,558
but um with little to no snow cover. So

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,800
um it's still important to record those

22
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,518
no survival ratings. Uh that helps us

23
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,920
establish a baseline for survival of

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,439
commercial cultivars and the range of

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,118
places uh where your trials are. Um but

26
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,639
it is a bummer not to see anything in

27
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,438
the spring.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,280
So, I'm here with my handy dandy rubric

29
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,079
to help me with my ratings. We're going

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,118
to start with winter survival. Uh, so a

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,280
one for winter survival and 0 to 20%

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,438
survived. If you did have total winter

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,478
kill, one is the rating you choose. So,

34
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:35,639
important to record. Uh, five is the

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,319
best rating. That's uh 80 to 100%

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,400
survival. The downfall with this type of

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,399
rating is that you have to remember what

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
your stand looked like in the fall. So

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,960
maybe you have some photos to remind you

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
what those plots looked like. So um

41
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,118
gauge as best you can what percent of

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,398
the plot that was there in the fall

43
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,879
still remains in the spring. In my plots

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
I had really nice winter survival.

45
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,640
Definitely winter damage, which we'll

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,759
talk about in a moment, but you'll see

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,399
that my plots look pretty full of nice

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,199
green pea plants. And so I'm going to

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,120
give these all five. They definitely all

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,679
uh survived at 80 to 100%.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,520
Winter damage for me was the hardest one

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,239
to rate. So, our scale goes from one,

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
which is damage to the whole plant. If

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,000
you have no survival, that's the one you

55
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,839
choose, to uh five, which is no damage

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,318
or just the borders of the leaves

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,800
looking like crispy paper.

58
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,679
So, I'm seeing a lot of plants like this

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,319
where there is damage to the stem, not

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,360
just to the leaves, which puts these

61
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,719
plants between a two and a three on our

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,400
rubric. So, a two would be major stem

63
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,280
damage in the range of 75% of the stem.

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,519
Uh, a three would be minor stem damage,

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,039
more like 25%.

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,280
So like these individual plants um I

67
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,679
would give a two but there is a whole

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,680
plot of other plants that um have

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
different levels of damage. So this is

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
the challenge of making a rating on a

71
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,840
plot basis rather than a plant basis. Um

72
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,799
so really just do your best to choose a

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,400
rating that is reflective of the entire

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,959
plot.

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,879
Um, in the same plot there are stems

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
like this which are barely damaged.

77
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,518
There's a little bit of leaf damage. Uh,

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
so that would be more like a four. So

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm going to kind of average that out

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
and say this plot gets a three for

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,239
winter damage because we have some

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,280
that's, you know, barely damaged at all,

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,239
some that is really uh quite damaged

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,959
down here. So for spring vigor, we're

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,239
looking at not necessarily the absolute

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,280
plant size, but how fast, how vigorously

87
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,000
is it putting on new

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,560
growth. So this is an awesome example of

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,840
uh high spring vigor. So putting on a

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,280
lot of new tender growth. Um you can

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,840
tell the plants really um awake and

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,598
alive and photosynthesizing and putting

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,680
on lots of new leaf tissue.

94
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,719
Um, again, we're rating a plot, not just

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,639
a plant. So, the other part of this plot

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
is not looking quite as hot. So, I'm

97
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,319
going to give this a four. So, that's

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,759
strong growth as kind of an average of

99
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,599
the really awesome looking uh part of

100
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,680
the plot and the less awesome looking

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
pot

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,759
part. This plot I'm going to give a

103
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,079
three. So, that's acceptable growth.

104
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,319
Like, it's it's certainly putting on new

105
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,240
growth. Like you can see at the end of

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,879
this like pretty damaged stem, it's

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,918
putting on this really nice uh new leaf

108
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,639
tissue. Uh but it really hasn't gotten

109
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,120
cranking to the degree that that other

110
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,519
plot

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,918
had. And now for arguably the most fun

112
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,560
trait, uh flavor. So you're going to

113
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,039
want to try the new growth. So something

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
like this that you can tell is new and

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,199
tender and it's easy to pinch off just

116
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
like

117
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,400
that. as opposed to say something like

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,879
this, like this is not going to be good

119
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,198
eats. That's going to be more woody and

120
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,279
not very tasty. I'm not going to make

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
you watch me chew things, but I found

122
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:23,359
some of these really delicious. Um, a

123
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,879
nice mix of sweetness and that rich pea

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,960
flavor that I think is really yummy. So,

125
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,600
uh, please sample if you like if you

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,359
like only if you like. Um, and rate

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,120
flavor and texture. It's a really easy

128
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,280
rating. just I want to eat this all the

129
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,240
time. I would seek it out. It's great.

130
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,119
That's a five. And one is yuck, no thank

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,680
you. I don't want that again. When you

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,918
rate flavor, you may have rated that in

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
the fall as well. So when you choose

134
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,879
flavor from the pull down menu, uh your

135
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,080
original ratings will come up. You can

136
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,399
click the little arrow next to uh your

137
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,599
star rating and you'll get a chance to

138
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,758
enter a new rating. So, if uh if

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
especially if your rating's changed, a

140
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,479
couple of mine did from fall to spring,

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
you can enter your new rating and if you

142
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,120
want, you can enter a comment like in

143
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,800
the spring this was very sweet or

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,759
something like that. Um and we we will

145
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,319
be able to distinguish using the time of

146
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,000
the data entry um what you thought about

147
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,000
fall flavor versus spring flavor.
