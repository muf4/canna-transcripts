1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,699
[Applause]

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,620
hi everyone I'm really happy to be here

5
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:13,479
this afternoon and share a little bit of

6
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,579
what I've been doing at Cornell for the

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,518
past year and so Don just gave an

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,439
introduction to what I'm doing here I'm

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,368
an anthropologist by training and I'm

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,669
taking advantage of this opportunity

11
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:26,768
that the NSF offers for social

12
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:30,268
scientists to gain experience in fields

13
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:32,679
outside of their major field and so

14
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,149
whenever I talk about the lost crops of

15
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,649
eastern North America it requires a lot

16
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,840
of exposition because most people have

17
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,370
never heard of them so I'm gonna kind of

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,309
start at the beginning and give you a

19
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:44,378
little brief interview to interview

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,089
introduction to how archaeologists

21
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,189
convinced ourselves and others that

22
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,769
these are indeed lost crops that some of

23
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:52,299
them were domesticated and then take you

24
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:54,488
through some aspects of my dissertation

25
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,140
research that led me to the questions

26
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,759
that I have about the role of plasticity

27
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,820
and domestication which is what I'm

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,320
exploring here and at the end I'll show

29
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,999
you some of the very kind of preliminary

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,319
observations or some of the things that

31
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,269
I've been doing here our plants are

32
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,559
still in the field right now so we'll be

33
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,289
harvesting them soon and then we'll have

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,390
more results from this year so first of

35
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,540
all my background what I've been trained

36
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,370
in is paleo ethnobotany which is a

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,590
sub-discipline of archaeology paleo

38
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,810
obviously stands for old I analyze

39
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,270
ancient plant remains that are recovered

40
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,920
from archaeological sites usually in my

41
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:29,739
case seeds and fruits but other small

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,510
fragments as plants will do um as know

43
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:33,069
as people so ethno botanist talked to

44
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,050
people a lot I sometimes talk to people

45
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,000
but because I study ancient agriculture

46
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,679
I'm more often will read historical and

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,109
ethnographic records to understand how

48
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,360
it really how a culture worked in the

49
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:44,500
past and then botany I don't think

50
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,859
really needs an introduction in this

51
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,540
crowd so just to kind of give you an

52
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,819
intro to how we get the types of plant

53
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,590
remains that I'm that I analyze or that

54
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,199
I specialize in and it's it's extremely

55
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,109
simple it's a method called flotation so

56
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,810
basically when we find context where

57
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,969
plant remains are likely to be found

58
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,140
such as this hearth which the flotation

59
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:07,209
sample has already been removed from

60
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,250
this floor that has tiny pieces of

61
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,019
charcoal embedded in it or this area

62
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,090
around a grindstone those seem like good

63
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,580
places to find plant remains we take a

64
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,900
soil sample and we process it by

65
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,469
floatation which basically just means

66
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,740
that we pour

67
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:23,590
into a bucket or a bin of water agitate

68
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,659
it and then pour off the organic

69
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,099
material that floats to the top so

70
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,689
that's my students are doing here

71
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,669
they're skimming the organic material

72
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,590
into a cheesecloth which we then dry out

73
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:35,619
it's very high-tech and we bring it back

74
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,360
to lab to analyze it so hopefully once

75
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,980
we picked out all the sort of roots and

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
modern seeds and things from the sample

77
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:44,379
that are not of interest to us what

78
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,339
we're left with is ancient plant remains

79
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,750
that were left behind by people and

80
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,550
because I study domestication I usually

81
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,349
take this one step further and take

82
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,780
micro photographs or some sort of images

83
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,609
of these seeds and fruits and then

84
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,560
analyze them to see if there's been any

85
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,730
change over time in the size and shape

86
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,129
of the fruits or if there's any

87
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,780
differences geographically and so this

88
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,939
happens to be the species that I studied

89
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,330
for my dissertation just to give you an

90
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:11,530
idea of kind of what my data looks like

91
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,880
there's a lot of variability obviously

92
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,259
but there's also variability how

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,849
well-preserved these are these are all

94
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:17,169
exceptionally well-preserved which is

95
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,849
why I bothered photographing them in the

96
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,099
first place but you can see that they're

97
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,269
not perfect and so another big aspect of

98
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,859
what I do is kind of trying to

99
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,909
reconstruct what they look like before

100
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,160
they were burned and buried in the

101
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:28,329
ground for a 2,000 years but I'm not

102
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,709
really going to talk much about how we

103
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,640
do that today because it's actually very

104
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,530
boring so domestication is what I

105
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,329
specialize in and the way that I define

106
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,939
that is a co-evolutionary relationship

107
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,560
where human practices are changing the

108
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,569
bodies and behaviors of plants and

109
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,280
animals and of course if it's a call

110
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,629
evolutionary relationship I strongly

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
believe that our relationships with

112
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,419
these plants and animals are also

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,430
changing our bodies and behaviors over

114
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,109
the course of thousands of years so the

115
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,150
reason why I chose these two images to

116
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,890
represent domestication is because these

117
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,200
were two very simple experimental

118
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,719
projects that taught us very important

119
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,729
lessons about how to massification works

120
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,409
so in the case of volumes Fox

121
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,959
experiments what he did was he just

122
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,120
selected wild foxes on one specific

123
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,920
trait which was lack of aggression

124
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,180
towards people and what ended up

125
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,919
happening over the course of several

126
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,600
generations is that a whole suite of

127
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,459
other traits that our domesticated man

128
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,910
will share things like shorter birth

129
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,259
intervals piebald codes floppy ears all

130
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,300
these different things that many of our

131
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,949
domesticated animals have ended up kind

132
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,900
of coming along with just the selection

133
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,279
for that one trait and so the

134
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,659
locations of this you know have been

135
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,489
really important people are still doing

136
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,770
research about how that works in our

137
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,418
domesticated mammals today and then

138
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,240
Hillman's experiments with wheat showed

139
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:43,310
that um if you exert really strong

140
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,960
selective pressure on wild wheat through

141
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,240
harvesting methods you can actually

142
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,799
domesticate it very rapidly so in both

143
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
cases it was a very simple experiment

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,669
that that showed us something really

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,590
fundamental about domestication and I've

146
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:58,819
really taken a lot of inspiration from

147
00:04:54,589 --> 00:05:00,709
studies like these in my own work so

148
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,240
this is the eastern agricultural complex

149
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,250
in this case eastern is referring to

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,620
eastern North America east of the Great

151
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,079
Plains and these are the plants that

152
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,168
people grew here in pre-columbian times

153
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,478
so some of these crops obviously are

154
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:16,609
familiar to us maize beans and squash

155
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,439
were and continue to be extremely

156
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,430
important to indigenous people that are

157
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:24,348
from Eastern Asian North America but the

158
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,180
wild progenitors of these plants are not

159
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,560
from eastern North America they were

160
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,750
first domesticated in what is now Mexico

161
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,478
and they reached the region where I work

162
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,918
around 900 AD incidentally it was

163
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,870
probably a little bit earlier in New

164
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,810
York that's a story for another day

165
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,459
and quite mysterious the plants that

166
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,680
were domesticated in eastern North

167
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,509
America from native while janitors are

168
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,939
other squashes like acorn squash and

169
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,500
sunflower that we still grow today but

170
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,168
the other five plants on this slide are

171
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,908
the lost crops so those are the species

172
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:55,399
that I'm studying and that I'm growing

173
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:58,098
right now so this is just they're sort

174
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,019
of in chronological order here from when

175
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:02,000
they entered the crop system so these

176
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,519
were the earliest followed by they're

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,918
both saw maturing pseudo cereals so non

178
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,930
non grass seed crops to spring maturing

179
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,819
grasses and then erect not weed entered

180
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,598
the crop system last probably around

181
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:19,038
2,500 years ago this is the area where

182
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:20,810
we have really good evidence that these

183
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,699
plants were grown we call it the core

184
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,918
area because there's not a good name for

185
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:26,569
it and like 21st century

186
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,250
geography like it's not really the

187
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,110
Midwest it's not exactly the southeast

188
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,300
but it made a lot of sense as a region

189
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,770
to ancient people because of the rivers

190
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,750
so it's basically centered on the

191
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,519
Mississippi River and includes most of

192
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,158
its important northern tributaries and

193
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,978
then there's two highland areas that are

194
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:43,879
on the periphery of this core area and

195
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:45,918
they've been really important

196
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,110
because we get better preserved plant

197
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,359
remains from caves and rock shelters and

198
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,249
so a lot of the evidence that I'll talk

199
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,749
about and all of the evidence that we

200
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,139
have that we can get ancient DNA out of

201
00:06:53,749 --> 00:07:01,759
comes from music peripheral highland

202
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,009
areas so I like to start talked about

203
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,229
this that aren't for archaeologists by

204
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,759
just explaining how we know that these

205
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,050
are lost crabs so that everyone doesn't

206
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,218
spend the whole time talking being

207
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,439
skeptical it all started with flotation

208
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:17,478
in the 1960s and one of the first things

209
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,919
that archaeologists started to notice is

210
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,699
they would excavate contacts like this

211
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:24,318
which is the bottom of a storage pit the

212
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,879
last 10 centimeters or so which are just

213
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,908
this dense layer of burnt plant remains

214
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,789
and in this case what this turned out to

215
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:34,848
be was a homogeneous mass of millions of

216
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:36,288
erect not weed seeds now this is one of

217
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:38,449
the assemblies that I analyzed for my

218
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,158
dissertation so I can also tell you that

219
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,869
it's from a domesticated population

220
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,368
which is an independent line of evidence

221
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:44,719
that these were cultivated plants and

222
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:47,749
I'll talk more about that in a second

223
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:49,009
but even just from the context this is

224
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:51,050
not the kind of thing that we would

225
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,999
expect to find if people were just you

226
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,680
know had these plants growing around and

227
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:56,050
we're occasionally using them this is

228
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,788
something that we would expect to find

229
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,059
when people are storing seeds to eat

230
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:04,519
them into and then we have even more

231
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:06,829
unambiguous evidence of seed storage

232
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,478
from context again on those peripheral

233
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:11,180
areas where we have dry caves and rock

234
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,949
shelters so maybe my favorite artifact

235
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,838
ever is this beautiful bag from Eden's

236
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,908
Bluff in Arkansas that's full of the

237
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:19,338
seeds of domesticated Keena podium our

238
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:21,860
quinoa cousin in eastern North America

239
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:23,809
and then this bundle of may grass is

240
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,158
also from Arkansas and it looks like I

241
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,659
could have harvested it you know a

242
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,408
couple years ago but actually it's about

243
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:31,610
2,000 years old so we have evidence not

244
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,750
only that people are storing these

245
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:43,250
plants but that they're storing their

246
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:45,259
seeds in particular probably both but we

247
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,850
know they were eating them and based on

248
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,680
the domestication syndromes that we see

249
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,040
we can be fairly sure that they were

250
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,338
also planting them so this is gets to

251
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,110
consumption this is a human a 3,000 year

252
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,019
old human feces

253
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,039
human poop and this kind of sealed the

254
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,350
deal I think for convincing

255
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,360
archaeologists in the late 1960s and

256
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,639
early 1970s that these were in fact

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,950
crops that people are consuming this

258
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,360
archaeologist Patti Joe Watson led

259
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,890
excavations of salts in Mammoth Cave

260
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
which are these deep dry caves in

261
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:17,509
Kentucky and one of the many things that

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,160
they found on there were human feces and

263
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,509
these are you know I've been directly

264
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,309
data they're three thousand years old

265
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:24,289
and they're full of the seeds of these

266
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,219
plants so hopefully if you didn't

267
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:29,120
believe that they were eating the seeds

268
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:32,000
before you're convinced now and then

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,500
sort of simultaneously archaeologists

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,299
started to send these plant remains to

271
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,980
botanist because back down there really

272
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:39,349
wasn't any such thing as paleo out the

273
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,639
botany so originally these plant remains

274
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,860
that were coming out of archaeological

275
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,419
sites were analyzed by botanist and what

276
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,220
they did is they referred back to this

277
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,620
you know early literature by people like

278
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,269
Harlan and his colleagues about

279
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,009
domestication syndromes and annual

280
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,328
plants to try and say okay is there

281
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,528
anything about these seeds that were

282
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,729
getting out at the archaeological record

283
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,278
that would indicate that they were

284
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,959
domesticated and we can't see all of

285
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,588
these things in normal archaeological

286
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,059
samples that we get like growth habit or

287
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,500
increase in seeds things like that are

288
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,479
really hard to see in the archaeological

289
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,339
record but there are some things that we

290
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,019
can see usually if we have a well

291
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,600
preserved seeds or fruits such as non

292
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,278
shattering greater seed size loss or

293
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,159
reduction of germination inhibitors and

294
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,629
loss of blooms and other appendages that

295
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:26,088
would make it difficult to process or

296
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:27,860
digest seeds so these bonus and and the

297
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,120
eventually archeologists that were

298
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,750
trained as paleo mouths and botanists

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,240
started to document on these changes in

300
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,220
the archaeological record so this is

301
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,028
some wheat is the common name for iva

302
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,129
annua this is from their sort of wild

303
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,958
comparative collections about three by

304
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,870
three millimeters as a normal size for a

305
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,609
fruit and then you can see sort of from

306
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,929
the older these dates are a little bit

307
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,360
wrong because this is an old paper but

308
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:55,789
from a later cake going up to the

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Mississippian increases in seed size

310
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:01,939
over time resulting in giant seated I

311
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,320
have an annual by about a thousand years

312
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,810
ago that's three to four times bigger

313
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,360
than it would be in a wild population so

314
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,799
that's seed size is the key criteria for

315
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,570
identifying domesticated

316
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,299
images of IVA which will become later

317
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,250
important later in this talk for kena

318
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:18,199
podium the key characteristic although

319
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,179
there are others is a reduction in the

320
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,690
thickness of its testa which makes it

321
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:25,069
germinate more easily so this is showing

322
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,740
these are old species names but

323
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,370
basically different native phenotypes of

324
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,639
wild kena podium with a thick testa like

325
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,360
40 to 60 microns and then for comparison

326
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,639
Chia

327
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,860
which is a domesticated kina podium

328
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,600
that's grown in Mexico and then this

329
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,419
archeological assemblage from Russel

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,190
cave which has even thinner testa than

331
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,889
our modern domesticate Chia down in

332
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,410
Mexico so again this is that for this

333
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,838
species that key criteria is as that

334
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:56,539
reduction in germination inhibitors and

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,640
then slightly less well-known is little

336
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,319
barley several archaeologists have

337
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,059
argued that little barley was also

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,129
domesticated either in the southwestern

339
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,199
in the southeast and the argument that

340
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:11,208
they make is a little bit complex so

341
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,180
these are experimentally burned seeds

342
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:15,439
that I burned myself this summer so

343
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,379
they're in like various states of

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,450
undress and you can see that after

345
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,309
they've been burned you still have the

346
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,810
chaff adhering you still have the Paleo

347
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:27,139
MLM of the glooms whatever adhering to

348
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,909
the cari OPS's the grain and the same is

349
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:30,649
true if you try to process little barley

350
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:32,028
in various ways like soaking it grinding

351
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,429
it pounding it it's really hard to get

352
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,200
everything off of that grain however in

353
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,028
the archaeological record we only find

354
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
these grains we never find chaff which

355
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:41,088
is actually really mysterious weird I

356
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,819
don't think it's been fully explained

357
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:47,149
but a partial explanation for it is that

358
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,310
there used to be a naked variety of

359
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,278
little barley domesticated like naked

360
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:53,629
barley in the old world so I'm pretty

361
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:54,740
convinced by this argument but I think

362
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,028
that we could keep doing more research

363
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,829
about it because it's really weird that

364
00:12:56,028 --> 00:13:02,509
we don't find chef when everyone else in

365
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:04,250
the world does so this was kind of where

366
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,720
things stood in terms of domestication

367
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,958
research when I started doing this in

368
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,660
2010 so we had really clear good

369
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,429
accepted evidence that some plead Pina

370
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,929
podium were both domesticated based on

371
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:17,000
changes in seed size and germination

372
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:19,189
inhibitors and a pretty solid argument

373
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,778
that little barley was as well and then

374
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,730
we had lots of evidence that may grass

375
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,870
was cultivated for a long time even

376
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,149
outside of its natural

377
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,250
no sort of morphological indicators that

378
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,419
it was domesticated and then there was a

379
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,799
rack knotweed which was mysterious and

380
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:35,689
kind of up in the air when I started

381
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,250
doing this research so I first heard

382
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,110
about this mystery when I was working in

383
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,360
the lower Illinois Valley which is a

384
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,250
really beautiful region has some of the

385
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,589
most productive and valuable farmland in

386
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,059
the United States today and this is kind

387
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,690
of looking out over the floodplain from

388
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,979
the bluff

389
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,170
which is where this little site is

390
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,149
located so this site was somebody's

391
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,528
house just one family's house about a

392
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:56,028
thousand years ago there were farmers

393
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:58,669
and one of the things that they were

394
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:00,230
growing was a was a rock not weed so

395
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:02,899
this assemblage of a rock not weed was

396
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,550
really really weird-looking um first of

397
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,110
all it's sprouting that's the obvious

398
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,370
thing that's weird about it and I don't

399
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,539
really have time to talk about sprouts

400
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,789
today but if there's anyone in the

401
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,860
audience that study sprouts I would love

402
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,028
to discuss it because I think that one

403
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,950
way that this plant may have been

404
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:19,639
processed to make it more nutritious and

405
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,528
easier to and easier to eat basically

406
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,480
would be to sprout it so that may be

407
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,129
intentional but there were other things

408
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,528
that were strange about this Eric now

409
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,870
eat and the botanists that analyzed it

410
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:31,159
in the 1980s basically said this doesn't

411
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,299
look like anything in our comparative

412
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,969
collection it certainly doesn't look

413
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,769
like a wreck that we'd so either it's a

414
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,180
domesticated form of a rock now eat or

415
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,730
else there's something missing from our

416
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:43,429
comparative collection basically this is

417
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,230
how it stood for 30 years and so when I

418
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,849
saw this as like working on my Master's

419
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,440
are like wow like this is such a neat

420
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,850
little question I can investigate for my

421
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,680
dissertation but it was actually a lot

422
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,139
harder to answer this question that I

423
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:58,069
anticipated that it would be as it

424
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,449
usually is but but I ended up being able

425
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,339
to convince myself and then eventually

426
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,940
you know a panel of anonymous botanist

427
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:06,650
that there was in fact an extinct

428
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,830
domesticated subspecies of erect not

429
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:12,199
weed in eastern North America and it is

430
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,959
the type specimen for this comes from

431
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,770
one of those rock shelter collections in

432
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:21,079
in Arkansas so in the course of doing

433
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,278
this research and convincing myself that

434
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,900
this was really a domesticated

435
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:27,200
population was when I first became

436
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:30,829
interested in plasticity because I was

437
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,209
taking seed samples from you know many

438
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,040
different species of clicking them first

439
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,338
and seeing how there is a ton of

440
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,230
variability within between species and

441
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:40,180
then eventually once I

442
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,789
you know established myself that I was

443
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:43,899
working with a wreck not weed from a

444
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,250
wreck now he that was growing in a lot

445
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,199
of different kinds of habitats and

446
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,240
different places and then eventually I

447
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,490
was cultivating it too and I started to

448
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,899
notice that there's a lot of variability

449
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,639
and what I was seeing in terms of seed

450
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,159
morphology depending on what was going

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,049
on with the plan so at first I'll admit

452
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,089
that I was just annoyed by plasticity I

453
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,679
saw it as noise and I wanted to be able

454
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,090
to eliminate it as a possible

455
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,849
explanation for what I was seeing in the

456
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,560
archaeological record but as I continued

457
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,420
to study it longer and longer I started

458
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,309
to think that it could possibly be

459
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,689
important for why this plant was

460
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,679
domesticated for how this site was

461
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,800
domesticated so in order to explain kind

462
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,059
of why I think that or using this as an

463
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,829
example I have to explain some things

464
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,139
about this plant because unless there's

465
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,940
weed scientists in the room people

466
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,850
probably don't aren't familiar with it

467
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,220
so it's fruits and flowers all summer

468
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,040
long so this is a typical sort of summer

469
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,170
plant it has pretty much for sure fruits

470
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,939
maturing fruits and flowers all on it

471
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,740
and then right before it dies it does

472
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,600
this thing where it was a big bout of

473
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,519
simultaneous fruiting and then the whole

474
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,810
plant is covered in seeds which is nice

475
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,779
if you're a farmer and you're growing up

476
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,279
recede another important thing about

477
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,439
this plant that you need to understand

478
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,059
is that under normal conditions in its

479
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,850
wild state it produces two different

480
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:01,779
kinds of fruits so dimorphic a keen a

481
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,480
keen is a type of fruit it produces this

482
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,920
one the tubercle dwarf all summer so if

483
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,569
you were to harvest all of the seeds off

484
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,730
of a plant in the summer they would all

485
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,470
be this form and then it starts to

486
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,819
produce these in the fall but these are

487
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,860
still adhering to the plant and they're

488
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,200
still being produced so any typical

489
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,879
harvest that you take in October and

490
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,559
November is going to be some proportion

491
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,280
of both of these from normal wild

492
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,659
populations um this is just like micro

493
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,910
photographs of the thickness of the

494
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,440
pericarp and just just quickly show the

495
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,850
difference but if you had a better image

496
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,140
like from an SEM or something of the

497
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,539
tuber called more if you could see that

498
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,280
it also has layers of wax which keep

499
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,720
water from getting into the seed and

500
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,809
also mechanically restrict the

501
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,640
germination of these seeds so the weird

502
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,990
thing about the domesticated assemblages

503
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,090
that we find in the archaeological

504
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,190
record there's two differences first of

505
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,569
all there are no tuber called morphs

506
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,490
they're completely missing or at least

507
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,500
there are very very few of them

508
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,808
also the smooth morphs are bigger than

509
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,839
you would really expect them to be my

510
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:00,599
favorite animation which is which have

511
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,119
been using up for years which is a

512
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:08,949
classic indicator of domestication and

513
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:10,959
annual seed crops so this disappearance

514
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,759
of the tubercle morphs is important from

515
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,558
the perspective of farming this crop or

516
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,509
from the perspective of domestication

517
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,639
because there's a really clear

518
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:20,429
germination heteromorphism between these

519
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,230
fruit types as well as you would expect

520
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,450
the smooth morphs germinate more readily

521
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,640
so in these experiments these seeds were

522
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,940
subjected to sort of standard simulated

523
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,159
winter so they were in moist substrate

524
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,870
at 4 degrees Celsius for 6 weeks and

525
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,370
after that treatment with some

526
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:37,719
exceptions you know I get pretty good

527
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,459
germination from this move Morris but

528
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,730
the tubercle Morris that's not enough

529
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,110
for them to germinate and then another

530
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,880
difference between them is that they

531
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,558
also grow more slowly once they

532
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,299
germinate probably because less of the

533
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,519
volume of fruit is made up of that

534
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:54,069
nutritive material that the seedling is

535
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,960
using for its early growth so this is

536
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:58,778
just visualizing that in a more

537
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,819
quantitative way number of leaves and

538
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:02,349
height as indicators of how big the

539
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:04,990
plants are at different times in the

540
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,129
first five weeks of growth and this

541
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,079
becomes important because if you have

542
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,760
human cultivators coming in and thinning

543
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,470
out stands of erect not wheat at any

544
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,390
point during the first five weeks of

545
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,919
growth they're going to remove more of

546
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,909
the seedlings that come from those

547
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,649
tubercle morphs

548
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,330
so if you have a plan in the previous

549
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:20,949
generation that produced a ton of sweet

550
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:22,480
most mostly smooth marks it's going to

551
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,009
Pat it's more of its offspring are going

552
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,740
to survive this kind of an activity by

553
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:28,599
people so okay maybe people were

554
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,849
thinning or maybe they weren't most

555
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:33,819
gardeners do most farmers and in the

556
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:38,278
past that practice scatter seeding did

557
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:40,389
but in the case of a rock not weed I

558
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:41,890
think it's even more likely that people

559
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,659
were thinning because there's a huge

560
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,330
difference in terms of yield depending

561
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:49,210
on plant density and part of the reason

562
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:50,619
why is because the plant produces seeds

563
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,480
and the axles of its branches so the

564
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,069
more highly branched it is the more

565
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,659
seeds it produces so in this case you

566
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,950
have more than twice as much seed and

567
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,610
basically the same amount of space as

568
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,960
these 20 plants produce um and you know

569
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,898
this is just showing that relationship

570
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,259
where the more the more the less dense

571
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:06,789
the

572
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,279
plants are the more branches they have

573
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,440
and then the more seeds they have and

574
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,299
that's interesting because in a typical

575
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,670
wild stand you're not gonna you're a

576
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:17,049
very very dense populations of a rock

577
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,420
not weed because they drop hundreds of

578
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,829
seeds right underneath them right so I

579
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,539
don't think it's giving ancient people

580
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:24,250
too much credit to suppose that they

581
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:26,649
would have noticed that thinning out a

582
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,750
stand like this could double their yield

583
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,930
right in the course of a single

584
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,519
generation so you know that's a pretty

585
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,110
neat little story of how domestication

586
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,700
occurred and we see this really strong

587
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:41,859
like kind of beautiful trend with only a

588
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,049
couple of weird things going on where

589
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:46,240
you have your modern you know a

590
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,919
comparative sample here and then in

591
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,539
chronological order you have fruits

592
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,490
getting bigger until the very end when

593
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,220
maybe some sterilizations is going on

594
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,509
and then these open circles indicate the

595
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,370
smooth morphs

596
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:59,379
so these later assemblages are almost

597
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:05,169
completely composed of smooth norms just

598
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,940
ignore that um and and so you know this

599
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,820
is a this is a really kind of classic

600
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,740
like a case of domestication what we

601
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:13,269
would expect but the problem with this

602
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,609
neat story is that in the course of

603
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:17,470
doing all this going iraq knotweed and

604
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,419
looking at it in the wild and stuff i

605
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,950
notice some stuff that made me think

606
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,769
that this might not be the end of the

607
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,090
story or it might not be the whole story

608
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:26,650
and i started to think that plasticity

609
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,990
might be a really important part of the

610
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,000
story so there so i started to look to

611
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,250
what people had been writing about

612
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,630
plasticity and domestication and of

613
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,369
course because I'm an anthropologist I

614
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,530
started with anthropology so one of our

615
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:41,289
most beloved theorists of domestication

616
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:43,420
and anthropology is Mindy's Eider who

617
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,730
works on animal domestication in the

618
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,320
Near East and she's been saying for you

619
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,339
know it's been general reason why I have

620
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,950
food and writing the bear appears

621
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:52,629
because you know it's generally accepted

622
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,250
it has been for a long time that some

623
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,110
animals are more domesticable than

624
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,059
others right like there's a reason why

625
00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:00,819
we don't have domesticated bears all

626
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:03,069
that would be fantastic if we did but

627
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:05,619
what Minnie has been arguing for a long

628
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:07,149
time is that rather than saying okay

629
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,729
this animal is domesticated when we see

630
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,590
a difference in its skeleton in the

631
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,450
archaeological record we should look at

632
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:14,949
behavioral indicators because there are

633
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,450
a lot of animals that were being penned

634
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,850
we're being brought in captivity or

635
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,100
ridden or milked or any number of really

636
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:23,500
important behavioral things before we

637
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:25,929
can see any morphological evidence from

638
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,369
their bodies they were domesticated so I

639
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,890
started thinking okay what's the

640
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:31,750
equivalent to these kinds of pliability

641
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,940
that we see in our domesticated animals

642
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,589
in the plant world and so I started

643
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,880
reading what evolutionary biologists

644
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,099
have been writing about plasticity and

645
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,900
evolution and realized that it's it

646
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:43,869
we're in the middle of a big to do about

647
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,970
it with some biologists arguing that the

648
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:47,799
modern synthesis needs to actually be

649
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,839
revised and updated in this extended

650
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,690
evolutionary synthesis to put more

651
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,819
emphasis on plasticity epigenetics and

652
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,110
niche construction so this is just from

653
00:22:54,819 --> 00:23:00,059
one of the papers you know it's sort of

654
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:02,229
arguing that looking at three different

655
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,359
genotypes and they're what's called

656
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,190
reaction norms in response to two

657
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,839
different environmental types and to

658
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,130
give you just kind of a concrete example

659
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,990
and are really easy to see one from

660
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,230
erect knotweed we've got these two

661
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,299
populations same time of year only like

662
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,220
an hour drive away from each other and

663
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,930
this one's like a little unbranched herb

664
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,039
and then my plants that I was growing in

665
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:26,950
the garden are like giant woody shrubs

666
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,019
so um sort of unresolved question with

667
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,330
the this whole how important is

668
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:34,299
developmental plasticity in evolution

669
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:38,019
question is how does something that's

670
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:39,430
originally plastic become fixed which is

671
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,220
genetic assimilation how does that

672
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,900
become a fixed trait and I think the

673
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,759
mechanisms that underlie genetic

674
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,460
assimilation if and when it happens are

675
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,779
really poorly understood and I really

676
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,190
think that domesticates are going to be

677
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:53,649
the best way to get to the bottom of

678
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,990
this because with domestic kids we have

679
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,790
before and after right we have the wild

680
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,039
progenitor and we have the domesticate

681
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:02,319
that came from it so we can look at

682
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,149
traits that are originally plastic and

683
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,289
then have become fixed in our domestic

684
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,160
'its and try to understand how that

685
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:11,589
occurred on one example just you know

686
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,940
there are there are other studies I

687
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,459
could point to but this is one that I

688
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,580
like and I think is cool is on manioc

689
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,829
which in its wild state can be either a

690
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:23,679
shrub or a vine depending on whether

691
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:26,710
it's growing in an open or a closed

692
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,930
canopy and it's domesticated state it

693
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,519
can still be a shrub or a vine but it's

694
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,740
much less good at being a vine and

695
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,019
frequently it breaks and falls down

696
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,429
so it's lost some of that plasticity

697
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:41,788
that it had in its wild state so

698
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,750
according to theorists of genetic

699
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:47,288
assimilation in order for this to occur

700
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,298
need a plastic trait obviously something

701
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:50,349
in the environment that changes

702
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,329
permanently because at least

703
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:55,449
hypothetically if the environment

704
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:57,009
continues to be unpredictable then it

705
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,330
will continue to be good for the plant

706
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,579
to be able to have these two different

707
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:02,500
phenotypes and some kind of an

708
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:05,048
evolutionary cost associated with

709
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,710
maintaining plasticity so the

710
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:12,460
non-plastic genotype is better than the

711
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,890
plastic one so if we take this example

712
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,230
of the dimorphism the fruit dimorphism

713
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:19,960
the two different types tuber gold and

714
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,640
smooth morphs the first question asked

715
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,558
is is this plastic and I discovered that

716
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,480
it was completely by accident when my

717
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,398
first experiment with this plant pretty

718
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,899
much utterly failed because I was

719
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,629
interested and you know what was causing

720
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:33,459
this time morphism and bla bla bla and I

721
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,890
grew these plants in a greenhouse where

722
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,690
they were subjected to 16 hours of light

723
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,690
and 8 hours of darkness no matter what

724
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,700
season it was and direct you know

725
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,679
unlimited light right above them and

726
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,600
what happened was they didn't ever

727
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,429
produce any smooth Mars they just

728
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,379
produce tubercle morphs and it was a

729
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,788
mountain war assemblage the opposite of

730
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,830
the domesticated ones that we're finding

731
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:56,288
in the archaeological record so it

732
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:57,788
definitely is plastic and what the first

733
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,230
thing I decided to investigate is what

734
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:02,319
that has to do with light so just ignore

735
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,819
how really messy this is by redo of this

736
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,548
experiment this year as much nicer

737
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:09,879
looking but for a first try gave me some

738
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:11,319
good data and I grew through the the

739
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,000
erect net weed outside and then I had a

740
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,189
shady and a sunny treatment to see if it

741
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,960
was day length strictly day length or

742
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,370
like light availability in general that

743
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,500
had something to do with the production

744
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:23,648
of these two from worse and what I found

745
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,269
again is that yes it's plastic there are

746
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:28,449
significant differences between the

747
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:31,898
percentage of one more for the other

748
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,399
that are produced by plants grown in the

749
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:34,750
shade versus the Sun the shady plants

750
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:36,849
produce more of the smooth morphs

751
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,740
but also in general the garden grown

752
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,538
plants produced more of the smooth

753
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,788
morphs than any of the wild populations

754
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:44,528
that I've looked at so in particular

755
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:46,299
these are all individual plants these

756
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:48,880
three plans that produce over

757
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:50,619
90% smooth moors if I found those in the

758
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
archaeological record I would say that

759
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,469
they were domesticated like that's

760
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,960
outside the range of variability that

761
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,970
I've documented in wild populations so

762
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,259
what is going on with these plants I

763
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,740
mean they're growing in a garden but

764
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:04,750
it's not a particularly well tended game

765
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,170
and so I'm not sure what is causing this

766
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,400
this level of plasticity and is there an

767
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,840
evolutionary cost of maintaining

768
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,400
plasticity yes and I think I've already

769
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,839
talked about this if people are coming

770
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,980
through and thinning out those plants

771
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,779
they're going to provide an advantage

772
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:21,339
plants that produce more of these smooth

773
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:22,660
waters from this and then are the

774
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,459
populations subjected to new

775
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,560
environmental conditions so the original

776
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,049
to answer first is where would they be

777
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,730
growing if they weren't in cultivation

778
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:33,430
and that's actually a really complicated

779
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,110
question because the landscape in my

780
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,670
study area has changed so dramatically

781
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:39,669
and so it could be a whole other talk

782
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,440
like well how do we reconstruct where

783
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,570
these plants were before the entire

784
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,400
Midwest was taken over by kind of

785
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:47,829
industrial food production but where

786
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,740
they grow today are in these highly

787
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:54,339
disturbed frequently flooded kind of

788
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,680
Creek banks and flood plains so I use

789
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,839
this as an example because it

790
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,060
illustrates why I think and this has

791
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,129
been theorized by other AI by plant

792
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,599
biologists why this plant has two

793
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,170
different types of fruits to begin with

794
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,669
right

795
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,519
it grows in an unpredictable environment

796
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,410
and sometimes what happens is like these

797
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,879
plants were coming up in May they just

798
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,200
had their very first little flowers and

799
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,210
then a week later there was like a

800
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,160
really extreme flood that scoured the

801
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,900
riverbank it was under water for over a

802
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,060
month and when I came back there in

803
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,530
October there was no and all that

804
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:26,679
generation of plants had been wiped out

805
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:28,869
yet the following year the population

806
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,580
was back so those tubercle dwarfs that

807
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:33,789
don't germinate very readily there

808
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:35,980
they're a bet hedging mechanism so that

809
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:39,579
the population can recover after a

810
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,089
catastrophic event at least in theory so

811
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:44,919
um again in theory dormancy strategies

812
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,959
like iraq knotweed and other plants that

813
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,230
have this kind of hetero germination

814
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,730
heteromorphism have this strategy of

815
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,029
escaping from unfavorable periods in

816
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,549
time right and so sampling different

817
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:59,859
growing seasons whereas plants that have

818
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,099
a very strong dispersal mechanism are

819
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,389
same

820
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:04,000
in different locations in the same

821
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,150
season and these could be seen as sort

822
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,058
of alternative ways of dealing with risk

823
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:12,820
so it stands to reason that if Iraq not

824
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:16,779
we'd obtained a new dispersal mechanism

825
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:18,639
ie humans its its existing dormancy

826
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,410
strategy would become less important for

827
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,990
its survival

828
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,220
so our populations subjected to new

829
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,660
environmental conditions I would say

830
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,460
based on the archaeological record we

831
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,350
can say that yes because we know that

832
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,440
people were taking these plants up out

833
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:33,819
of the floodplain and clearing locations

834
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,679
on terraces that would otherwise be

835
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:38,379
stable forest ecosystems to grow these

836
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,538
crops and we know that they were storing

837
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,549
the seeds and keeping them safe which

838
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:45,308
provides an alternative to storage and

839
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,750
the soil seed bank so in this case that

840
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:49,000
those typical morphs are no longer

841
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,230
necessary for the survival population

842
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,839
because it's living in a more stable

843
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,370
environment and because of thinning and

844
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,849
cultivation behavior they're actually

845
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,048
detrimental to to the plant

846
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:01,089
so as I'm discovering all this stuff

847
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,769
about Iraq now and thinking ok maybe

848
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:04,689
genetic assimilation is part of the

849
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:06,730
story of how this plant was domesticated

850
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,830
my colleagues were coming to similar

851
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,470
conclusions about two of the other lost

852
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:13,298
crops so my colleague Liz was work is

853
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,669
working throwing all the last crops in

854
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:17,470
her garden and down in Arkansas but in

855
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,720
particular she was noticing some fishy

856
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,548
business with IVA and you want some weed

857
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,620
which you can see is dwarfing her in her

858
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:27,190
garden this is not a normal height for

859
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:29,769
IVA then my colleague Paul and his

860
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,450
students were growing kina podium oh hi

861
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:34,119
Oh University and also sampling from a

862
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,038
lot of different wild populations so um

863
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,199
the basis of our project about

864
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:41,440
plasticity and domestication rested on

865
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,269
three observations that were made Liz in

866
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,669
her garden noticed that over the course

867
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,529
of four growing seasons the IVA started

868
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,809
to spontaneously produce bigger seeds

869
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:51,038
and this was about any kind of selection

870
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:53,019
for bigger seems like she wasn't

871
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,250
thinning she wasn't planting them deep

872
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,129
she wasn't doing any of the things that

873
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,210
we thought for generations caused the

874
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,330
increase in seed size and our

875
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,529
domesticated plants and yet if we again

876
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:04,029
if we found these seeds in the

877
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,589
archaeological record we would say they

878
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,418
were kind of borderline domesticated

879
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:08,980
like they're definitely above the cutoff

880
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:11,200
or what we've considered to be

881
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,690
domesticated IVA so what's going on with

882
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,058
that I've already talked a lot about

883
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,190
so I'm not gonna belabor it but again if

884
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:19,839
I found these particular plants in the

885
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,490
archaeological record I would also say

886
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,519
based on the criteria that I myself just

887
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,319
made up that they're domesticated so you

888
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,058
know I hate to contradict myself so soon

889
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,038
but we may need to kind of either

890
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:33,369
rethink our defining domestication or

891
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:36,009
rethink our criteria and finally with

892
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:38,859
kina podium what we're finding is that

893
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:40,899
we we knew that some of these seeds that

894
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:43,418
have thin test has occurred naturally in

895
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:44,949
wild populations and you can sort of see

896
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,570
them with your naked eyes the ones that

897
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,788
show up is red or yellow instead of

898
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:50,558
black they have a thinner testa but what

899
00:31:48,788 --> 00:31:52,569
we're seeing harvesting for more

900
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,428
different populations of can podium is

901
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:57,158
that actually it can be up to you know

902
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,929
like 50 percent of wild plant can have

903
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,028
these on taneous they have these thin

904
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,070
testa's so again we want to figure out

905
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:05,138
what's well first of all what's going on

906
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:07,689
with chenopodium because it's mass just

907
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:09,878
in terms of those species delegations

908
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,950
and things like that but also what sorts

909
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:16,240
of environmental conditions may be

910
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:18,580
causing this variability that we see so

911
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,339
these three projects make up this larger

912
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:22,808
project a palette for selection which we

913
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,788
are doing in collaboration with Logan

914
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:27,369
Kistler at the Natural History Museum

915
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:29,648
Smithsonian National Museum of Natural

916
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,959
History and the part of it that I'm

917
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:34,628
currently executing right now is the

918
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,460
polygamy doing that except messy-looking

919
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:40,569
experiment that I showed you from st.

920
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:44,079
Louis with the Sun in the shade and we

921
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:46,058
are taking RNA samples from leaves

922
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,558
flowers and developing fruits every two

923
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:52,178
weeks so that we can try and see at what

924
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:53,829
point this this trigger happens where

925
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:56,048
the plants start producing these smooth

926
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:58,480
morphs and if that's happening more so

927
00:32:56,048 --> 00:33:01,388
or earlier in one treatment versus the

928
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,548
other which is a good sort of way to

929
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:06,369
transition into talking a little bit

930
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,940
about the molecular facets of paleo

931
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:10,000
ethnobotany

932
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,308
so this is changing really fast ancient

933
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,409
DNA especially human ancient DNA

934
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:16,000
research has exploded exponentially in

935
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,259
the past five years and I'm hoping that

936
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,450
we're gonna see a similar kind of

937
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:21,940
explosion of research in ancient plant

938
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,139
DNA but so far in eastern North America

939
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,909
there's already been some cool stuff

940
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:26,019
it's all been based on chloroplast DNA

941
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:28,028
so if

942
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:29,190
and mostly what it's been used for is

943
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:33,278
biogeography

944
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,900
so um studies of where what you know

945
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,400
ancient populations of squash and how

946
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,350
they're related to to modern populations

947
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,298
of squash and this really cool mystery

948
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:45,908
about bottle gourds and how they ended

949
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:48,250
up getting from Africa to North America

950
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:48,669
10,000 years ago which is a story for

951
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,558
another day

952
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:56,020
and then biogeography proving that or

953
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,639
demonstrating that kina podium was

954
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:59,048
independently domesticated in eastern

955
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,570
North America and same thing for

956
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:03,970
sunflowers so molecular backup for those

957
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:06,579
being from eastern North America as

958
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,800
opposed to some other region and then

959
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:10,779
most recently chloroplast DNA has been

960
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
used to look at sort of biodiversity in

961
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,320
the ancient biodiversity and so this

962
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:18,098
study just came out it's my favorite

963
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,280
paper of 2018 and it's showing a couple

964
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:23,320
a few ancient genomes in here

965
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,179
ancient plasto's I should say and a lot

966
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,820
of historical and ethnographic alene own

967
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,139
sunflower landraces and modern cultivars

968
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,639
and there's a lot of really interesting

969
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,128
things on this paper so I encourage you

970
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,510
to just go read it but one thing that I

971
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:36,159
really like about it is that it's

972
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,869
showing first of all that we've even

973
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,579
compared to we know we've lost a lot of

974
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:42,550
agro biodiversity in the past hundred

975
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:46,000
years but even compared to that there

976
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:48,190
still are even more ancient losses that

977
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,898
we've suffered so one of these sort of

978
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,280
types is not represented one of the

979
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:53,500
ancient types it's not represented in

980
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,379
any of the you know modern samples that

981
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,760
we have and also that ancient people

982
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:59,500
were cultivating more than one land race

983
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,060
in the same place which is cool I mean

984
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,750
it's to be expected but it's nice to

985
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:07,719
have proof so ancient epigenomics is

986
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,550
just kind of getting started and again

987
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,459
has mostly been deployed on humans not

988
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,410
plants but could be really cool way to

989
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,108
explore plasticity and plant

990
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:20,608
domestication as well so irony has been

991
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:22,929
extracted from ancient maize kernels

992
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:25,119
methyl homes have been reconstructed for

993
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:26,529
ancient humans and relatives I don't

994
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,210
know how useful this is going to be for

995
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,490
plant investigations since most of our

996
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,260
well-preserved DNA comes from seeds and

997
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,598
seeds are inherently not really doing

998
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,250
much before they germinate but hopefully

999
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,780
maybe we can come up with some

1000
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,750
applications for this going forward as

1001
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,970
our methods improve

1002
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,559
and then another thing that's starting

1003
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:45,359
to come out of the ancient DNA research

1004
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,679
for plants is looking at kind of these

1005
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,630
deep histories of plants and their

1006
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,949
evolution in human communities so this

1007
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,150
is sorghum both these studies are about

1008
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:57,059
sorghum this one is kind of showing how

1009
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,980
the major land races of sorghum are are

1010
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:01,019
correlated with ethno-linguistic groups

1011
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,289
across the African continent so kind of

1012
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:06,599
looking at the connections between human

1013
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:08,250
cultural movement and interaction and on

1014
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,069
the one hand and agro biodiversity on

1015
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,139
the other hand and this one's looking it

1016
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:16,130
is a huge amount of ancient plant

1017
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,629
genomes in comparison to other studies

1018
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,340
and what is showing is that these really

1019
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,230
well differentiated land races that we

1020
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,480
have in sorghum are probably pretty

1021
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,980
recent because all of the ancient

1022
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,880
genomes are kind of falling into this

1023
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,409
undifferentiated

1024
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,940
area and there are other conclusions in

1025
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:32,539
this paper that I can't don't have time

1026
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,490
to get into that basically indicate that

1027
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:37,800
sorghum the the bottleneck that were

1028
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:40,649
sorghum lost biodiversity with respect

1029
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,269
to its wild ancestor didn't occur at the

1030
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,340
beginning of its domestication it

1031
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,869
occurred thousands of years later so

1032
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,640
that's kind of contradicting what we

1033
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:49,319
have thought about domestication in the

1034
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,879
past and it's highlighting the

1035
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,800
importance of instead of looking at

1036
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,530
domestication like oK we've identified

1037
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,090
when this was domesticated and then we

1038
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,650
have like when the early botanist went

1039
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,230
out and collected and everything in

1040
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,490
between is just awash there's a lot of

1041
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,780
kind of evolution in different

1042
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,399
trajectories that were happening in

1043
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,560
between those two points that need to be

1044
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,710
investigated

1045
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,779
so um by way of wrapping up in time for

1046
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,860
some questions I just want to just show

1047
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,440
you some of the other things that I'm

1048
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,570
doing and as I said I don't have like

1049
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,950
concrete results yet because we're still

1050
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,150
doing this stuff but one of the things

1051
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:23,159
that we're looking at is how to get

1052
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,900
these things to germinate it's not that

1053
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,269
easy to get wild plants to germinate in

1054
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,619
comparison to crops and that's probably

1055
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:30,150
something that ancient people struggled

1056
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,849
with and they started to actually plant

1057
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,110
these so you know we started over the

1058
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:35,549
winter with just doing like simulated

1059
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,260
winter treatments so that we could

1060
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,180
figure out how to even get any of the

1061
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,910
seeds to germinate for big experiments

1062
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,069
this spring but this winter we're going

1063
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,839
to do some other things to try and get

1064
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,370
better germination rates and from a

1065
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,900
practical standpoint this is important

1066
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,759
because if other people are gonna pick

1067
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,170
this up and do research about it they

1068
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,210
have to be able to get these things

1069
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,920
to Germany it's it's such a headache in

1070
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,369
it it really can slow down the

1071
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,630
experiments or ruin them it doesn't work

1072
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,140
and then you can see like this

1073
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,430
experiment that I spent such a long time

1074
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:07,650
sort of setting up is right here back

1075
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:09,088
here but the majority of the area that

1076
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,619
we're cultivating is actually what I'm

1077
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:12,539
just calling general experiments and

1078
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,220
what we're looking at there is just the

1079
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,619
effects of multi cropping and plant

1080
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:19,230
spacing on yield and just plant health

1081
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,059
plant size so one of the things that we

1082
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,699
think based on you know historically

1083
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,650
known and currently conducted Native

1084
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:28,348
American agriculture is that it's

1085
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,910
probably a multi crop system there there

1086
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:33,180
wasn't very much mono cropping going on

1087
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:34,170
in the new world and so what kind of

1088
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:36,029
synergies there may have been between

1089
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,430
these plants in the past we don't know

1090
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,260
how well they would do with each other

1091
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:43,169
versus if they're grown by themselves

1092
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,880
and I took this picture because these

1093
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,099
are the two oldest lost crops can you

1094
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,230
podium an IVA and they grow in very

1095
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,240
similar types of environments naturally

1096
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,619
and they seem to be doing very well

1097
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,209
together out in the field so we'll see

1098
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,099
what kind of yields we get from them

1099
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:59,548
when they're when they're in a little

1100
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:00,660
community versus by themselves and then

1101
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,130
this is something that I haven't really

1102
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,149
had time to circle back to in like

1103
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,650
months because I've been out in the

1104
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,329
field all the time but we're taking

1105
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,639
these kind of overhead shots of the

1106
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:10,710
plots every week so that we can

1107
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,029
hopefully get the computer to learn how

1108
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,889
to pick out the different species and

1109
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,260
calculate how much of the canopy they're

1110
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:17,818
making up so if any I know some people

1111
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,700
here do that because I've seen posters

1112
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:22,769
around so if anyone has good ideas for

1113
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:25,259
me about how to operationalize that I

1114
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:27,210
would love to hear hear them and then

1115
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,970
finally we've noticed some kind of

1116
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,150
strange things about the lost crops and

1117
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:34,379
this will just be my final kind of take

1118
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,970
so the may grass which I haven't said

1119
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,760
really anything about it's called may

1120
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:41,459
grass because it produces seeds in May

1121
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,200
usually here are produce seeds in like

1122
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,630
mid-june because it doesn't usually grow

1123
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,489
in New York but regardless it produces

1124
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,019
seeds in the summer and so some

1125
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:51,088
archeologists have been wondering for

1126
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,619
years if it would be possible to get to

1127
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,909
crops out of May grass like if you

1128
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,410
harvested the seeds in May and then

1129
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:57,358
replanted them could you get a fall crop

1130
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:59,190
but it turns out that it's actually even

1131
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,929
easier than that because if you just

1132
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,429
keep the area around the May grass

1133
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:04,558
weeded it will die in the middle of the

1134
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:06,149
summer and then spontaneously regenerate

1135
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,619
in the fall so

1136
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,240
we thought that these plants had

1137
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,769
completely smashed and were dead and

1138
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,149
then a few weeks ago they started

1139
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:13,588
sending up new seed heads and now we're

1140
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,910
getting a second crop of May grass out

1141
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,650
there so that's nice if you're a farmer

1142
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:18,598
you don't to do anything so you know

1143
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,599
keep it clear

1144
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,519
and then our IVA was struggled a lot

1145
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,869
like it really didn't do well at all and

1146
00:40:23,518 --> 00:40:26,548
I think the reason why is because we're

1147
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:30,240
way up on top of a hill on Caldwell Road

1148
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:32,009
and I didn't and we had a really dry

1149
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,258
June and it just didn't germinate well

1150
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:36,179
at all so this picture is kind of harder

1151
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,710
to interpret but this is the lowest plot

1152
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,268
like it's probably about a meter lower

1153
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,190
than the other one's not very extreme

1154
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:43,739
slope but this is the only one of these

1155
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,809
abandoned plots were nothing germinated

1156
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,848
that had any ayah this is IVA right here

1157
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:50,160
at all germinate in it so that little

1158
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,509
difference in altitude and soil Marsh

1159
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,848
moisture I think although I wasn't

1160
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:55,349
directly measuring that is making a huge

1161
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:57,240
difference in terms of whether or not

1162
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:59,160
this plant can germinate and grow which

1163
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,778
is important for reconstructions of how

1164
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,009
this agricultural system worked because

1165
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:03,509
if people were trying to grow these

1166
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:05,670
plants together but one of them couldn't

1167
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:08,159
tolerate being you know taken out of its

1168
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,630
sort of marshy environment then that

1169
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,568
presents a constraint for the

1170
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,829
agricultural system so on that note I

1171
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:21,239
guess I will take questions for the next

1172
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:23,460
five minutes or so before I do that I

1173
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,079
just want to thank my especially thank

1174
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,900
my students one of whom is here Andrea

1175
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,609
and Peter for just being awesome the

1176
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,778
summer and keeping the experiments

1177
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,909
running when I've been out of town and

1178
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:37,739
just being really great thanks Andrea

1179
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:40,498
all right anyone have questions is there

1180
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:44,999
a salinity factor here as well because

1181
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:53,098
both opposed I have a no upper salt

1182
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:56,038
marsh um maybe I mean it's definitely a

1183
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,630
factor to be explored although many of

1184
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,470
the places that I found them growing are

1185
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:04,079
not particularly salty and you know like

1186
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:05,909
out in the wilds of the Midwest but it's

1187
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,140
definitely one of many factors that

1188
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:09,449
could be affecting how well they're

1189
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:11,159
doing and because I really only had the

1190
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,659
time and resources to grow them in one

1191
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,248
location I really wanted to do two

1192
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:15,568
different locations the summer but it

1193
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:18,179
was just I just didn't have enough

1194
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:19,409
manpower basically but yeah the soil

1195
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:21,210
soil could be a huge

1196
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:27,690
factor that I really want to look into

1197
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:31,619
in the future I'm assuming that the

1198
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:35,250
indigenous people who said on the king

1199
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:38,430
of podium and IVA were doing so because

1200
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:41,179
they were nutritionally rich has any

1201
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:44,608
research been done looking at the

1202
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:48,838
nutrient content of the more ancient

1203
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:51,630
seed versus their contemporary varieties

1204
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,308
yeah so there has been very limited

1205
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,440
research done on the nutritional

1206
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:57,740
properties of these plants there's one

1207
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,730
paper that looks at kind of like gross

1208
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:02,818
nutritional properties like protein

1209
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:05,010
versus fat versus carbohydrates this is

1210
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:08,548
something that has been constrained by

1211
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,109
lack of seeds too right like we want to

1212
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,608
do cooking experiments and nutritional

1213
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:13,798
experiments for these plants but so far

1214
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:15,598
like good farmers we had to first see to

1215
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:17,548
our needs for next year in terms of

1216
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,990
planting so one of the things that I

1217
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:20,400
didn't talk about but I'm hoping to get

1218
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,689
out of this is we're also just growing a

1219
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,608
bunch of plants in the greenhouse or

1220
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:27,420
seed so that we can do this kind of

1221
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:29,068
stuff and I and and it may be possible

1222
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,838
to do some kind of nutritional analyses

1223
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:32,608
of the ancient domestic it's to the ones

1224
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,798
that are from the desiccated collections

1225
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:37,108
I just don't know enough about how that

1226
00:43:34,798 --> 00:44:08,009
works to to know for sure I need a good

1227
00:43:37,108 --> 00:44:10,619
collaborator yeah okay so Dan is asking

1228
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,299
basically why these crops fall out of

1229
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,579
cultivation if it was environmental

1230
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:17,250
cultural or some kind of combination of

1231
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,619
the two and this is a huge question that

1232
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,088
I would love to do like a large a

1233
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,289
long-term project on so one of the

1234
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:23,489
biggest problems I think that we have

1235
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,079
with answering this question is that

1236
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:27,239
archaeologists really like to date the

1237
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,710
earliest occurrence of things but

1238
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,899
they're not at all interested in dating

1239
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,338
the latest occurrence of things so we

1240
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,889
actually don't really know when these

1241
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:34,539
plants

1242
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:35,529
out of cultivation because people aren't

1243
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,989
like trying to find the latest

1244
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:41,050
assemblage and data what I personally

1245
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:43,329
think based on you know a sort of

1246
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,830
cursory literature review is that there

1247
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,449
were at least some farmers that were

1248
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:49,299
still growing these crops right up until

1249
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:51,339
European colonization began and that

1250
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,050
that knowledge was lost along with

1251
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,700
probably lots of other knowledge as

1252
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,820
communities are moving around and people

1253
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:59,679
and work and so much work fare and

1254
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,510
destruction was happening right so I

1255
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,859
think that was going on but it is

1256
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,750
undeniable that there were definitely

1257
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,640
less people growing them by the time of

1258
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,739
European colonization and had been

1259
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,170
before amazed beans and squash arrived

1260
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:13,000
so I do think that to a certain extent

1261
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,329
once people had functioning Mazal and

1262
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,309
races that like worked for this climate

1263
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:19,989
it was a better crop i I do think that's

1264
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:21,159
part of the answer because people all

1265
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:23,679
over the world have adopted maize

1266
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,269
because it's highly productive but

1267
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,339
there's probably other things going on

1268
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:35,650
too and some communities like that one

1269
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:36,910
where I was like ignore this yeah so one

1270
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,210
of the things that's kind of like an

1271
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:41,980
archeological detail has to do with that

1272
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,750
so this this is some allege here that's

1273
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,550
not domesticated that looks like it's

1274
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,110
even smaller than the wild population it

1275
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,190
might not even be the right species like

1276
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,450
these people might have been just

1277
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,150
cultivating the wrong species

1278
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:53,859
um I say wrong because it was different

1279
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,170
from what everybody else was ever

1280
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,059
cultivating these are early adopters of

1281
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,480
maize this culture is called fort

1282
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:03,219
ancient and it's a approximately

1283
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,199
thousand-year-old culture in the Ohio

1284
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:07,359
River Valley that's known for adopting

1285
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,519
maize and as a staple crop really early

1286
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,380
before other people had switched over so

1287
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,639
it doesn't really surprise me that their

1288
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,590
knowledge of a rock not wheat and their

1289
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,299
seed stock wasn't very good considering

1290
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,220
that there was so focused on maize so

1291
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,080
there was a lot of variability too I

1292
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:21,399
guess it's not really an answer but

1293
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:34,150
somebody you should write a dissertation

1294
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:37,530
about it someday we got one more in the

1295
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,530
back and then okay

1296
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:51,289
so the shattering is the thing that

1297
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,429
people who study serial domestication in

1298
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:54,050
the old world that's their favorite

1299
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,029
criteria because it's less like

1300
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,650
wishy-washy than seed size and they

1301
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:01,280
don't actually use a seed they use the

1302
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:03,889
chaff so they'll look at the morphology

1303
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,810
of the reyga's just to see whether it

1304
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:08,000
was like a robust connection that had to

1305
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:09,529
be like broken or whether it was like I

1306
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,420
don't have an image of it right now but

1307
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,500
it's it's based on experimental studies

1308
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,940
that where they've looked at the

1309
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,650
morphology and wild and domesticated

1310
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,210
types and there may be something

1311
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,700
somewhere for these crops nobody's

1312
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,079
looked at it as far as I know tried to

1313
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,460
but the thing is a lot of them are into

1314
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:26,150
hissing in their wild state which is

1315
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:29,389
also a story for another day so Geneva

1316
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:34,910
you have any questions its buckwheat old

1317
