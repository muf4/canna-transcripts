1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:13,830
all right so I am the last speaker of

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,029
the session and I'll dress myself for

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,980
those who don't know me I'm Elena

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,320
vitamin yoga and faculty at the soils

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,929
and crop Sciences section and pond

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,910
biology section here at Cornell and what

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,278
I'm going to talk today about is about

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,399
using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,469
microscopy I'll refer to it as XRF as an

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,660
imaging and high-precision phenotyping -

13
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,730
for studies of my knowledge and from

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,159
their studies and I'll talk today mainly

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,049
about iron - micronutrient Iowa

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,359
recruited copper because that's what we

17
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,609
study in a lab and also because of the

18
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,879
relevance of these elements for the

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:50,519
future food security and human health

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,440
just any briefly what I do today after a

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,530
really short introduction providing the

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,209
rationale for studies of iron and copper

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,520
for my status and wealth I'll briefly

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,289
introduce the basics of salford on x-ray

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,450
fluorescence microscopy and the

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,039
relevance of this technology for studies

27
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,909
of my knowledge and from the stylus and

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,639
then in the last part I'll show you some

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,549
examples from my lab which demonstrate

30
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:16,560
how a seraph is used for us to

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,109
understand the function of the illegal

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,079
pet a transporter or bt3 in iron from a

33
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:24,748
stylus and the whole pathway exposed a

34
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:27,779
regulatory path 5007 set 1 regulated

35
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:29,578
pathway in copper camila status and

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,950
relationship between copper and plant

37
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,288
fertility and again the studies are done

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,879
mainly in Arabidopsis but i'll continue

39
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:42,478
with some crop species so as many of you

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,638
appreciate providing the enough food for

41
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,248
the growing food for the growing wealth

42
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:50,068
population is one of them top challenges

43
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:52,708
of the 21st century and even today after

44
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,618
a billion people though in world go to

45
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,810
bed hungry they consume less than 2,000

46
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,429
calories per day and these are people

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,340
mainly in the developing countries that

48
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,409
you can see from this map but and in

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,179
this countries people mainly because of

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,080
their resource poor they mainly confined

51
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:12,360
to plant-based food and so these

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,430
plant-based food the staple crops which

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,950
are grown and use the discounters mainly

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,599
rice or in some case of sweet

55
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:20,669
in terms of all in the concentration of

56
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,729
nutrients and minerals such as iron

57
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,549
copper and zinc and so in addition to

58
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,919
consuming fewer than 2,000 calories per

59
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,800
day people in these countries they

60
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,169
suffer from so-called hidden Congress

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,590
which was the term coined by Roswell

62
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:39,419
sheared carnality in v8 to reflect the

63
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,500
nutrient deficiency associated health

64
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:47,518
disorders for example many of you know

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,469
and many of you probably know that iron

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,959
deficiency anemia is one of the most

67
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,789
prevalent attritional disorder and it

68
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,950
affects more than 30 percent of the

69
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,469
world's population and actually it is

70
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,509
responsible for up to a million deaths

71
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,848
annually and again if you look in this

72
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,620
map these are people which are living in

73
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,959
developing countries and again people

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,799
these countries are confined mainly to

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,199
plant-based food and so one of the ways

76
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,010
have to combat this malnutrition is to

77
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,229
buy a fortified crops with nutrients and

78
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,899
with minerals and this is emerges as a

79
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:26,280
one of the sustainable approaches how to

80
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:30,060
deal with malnutrition what's happening

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,818
here okay so copper deficiency in humans

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,209
is not as widespread as iron deficiency

83
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:38,129
however copper deficiency in soils can

84
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,849
really dramatically decrease a crop

85
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,609
productivity

86
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,409
well it's significantly affect one

87
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:45,480
fertility and wheat and in total its

88
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,609
sufferers apparently with the most from

89
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,298
corporal deficiency

90
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:53,340
and so and those deficiency like iron

91
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,840
deficiency in the soil and copper

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,150
deficiency and so and when it's actually

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,459
a zinc deficiency occurs mainly in

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,120
alkaline soils here in the map you can

95
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,519
see it call it as boom and this alkaline

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,400
and also natural soils they defy more

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,030
than 30 percent of the arable land right

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,879
and so if we really wanna sort of meet

99
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,189
the challenge of providing more

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
increasing food production by 70 percent

101
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,788
in the next 40 years and also if you

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,149
want to make sure that we are able to

103
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:26,519
buy a fortified edible parts of of

104
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:28,609
plants with nutrients really need to

105
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,829
know how plants have crops deal with

106
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,810
their environment in certain environment

107
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:35,658
in the limitation of micronutrients in

108
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,180
the environment and so it comes down to

109
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:40,158
knowledge of the transport system so we

110
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,439
need to know how transporters which

111
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:44,750
transporters and which regulators or

112
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,110
those transporters are responsible for

113
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,310
moving elements under you know under

114
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,169
deficiency condition from the soil into

115
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,718
the root how this animals which

116
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:55,370
transfers how this elements are

117
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:58,399
distributed in the plant where you load

118
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,288
it into the edible tissues how they are

119
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:04,250
reabsorbed for example from leaves and

120
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:06,589
moved to things such as seeds and in

121
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,228
that regard x-ray fluorescent microscopy

122
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:11,750
to measures like really a powerful tool

123
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:13,668
which allows us to identify knowledge

124
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,500
ease and characterized genes which

125
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:18,318
involved in Merrell newton commerce data

126
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,680
for example the reason why XRF is so

127
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,718
useful and can be useful because

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,370
normally in many cases disruption of

129
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:27,500
genes encoding transporters or

130
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,110
regulators of the transporters will

131
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,759
release to the to the to changes in the

132
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,629
distribution of the spatial distribution

133
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,389
of elements in in a plant in a tissue or

134
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:42,080
actually and subcellular lee and so one

135
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,939
can use it just use XRF to compare the

136
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,250
wild-type tissue rest of the mutant

137
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,408
issue and see whether the changes of the

138
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,158
special distribution occur or not and

139
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:55,370
here this is almost a classical example

140
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:58,278
for all marabou barillo lab showing arab

141
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,158
adopts this wild-type seed and iron

142
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:02,899
distribution in a wild pepsi and this is

143
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:05,028
a mutant for the vacuole or iron

144
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,978
transporter and against a mutant seed

145
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:09,019
and you can see that the pattern of iron

146
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:11,120
distribution significantly changes and

147
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:13,038
of course combining other functional

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,399
genomic approaches where one can infer

149
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:21,560
what are the gene function

150
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:25,698
so how xref help was XRF restore so xref

151
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,649
is imaging technique which allows you to

152
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,830
visualize the spatial distribution of

153
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:32,870
elements in a sample at the different

154
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,938
resolution scales and really in a

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,338
nutshell very simplistically XRF is

156
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,199
based on the detection of secondary

157
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:40,600
arrays or recall it fluorescence which

158
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,240
are emitted by atoms

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,070
of the sample when the sample itself is

160
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,740
arrested through with x-ray the reader

161
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,629
high-energy x-rays that are generated at

162
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,810
a synchrotron and the really cool

163
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:57,069
feature about this technique is that

164
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,110
each element emits very specific energy

165
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,730
fingerprint and what it allows you it

166
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,980
allows you to map the distribution of

167
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,259
specific and form of the distribution of

168
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,080
particular element in a in a sample and

169
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,360
here the concept the fight by the

170
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,949
distribution analysis of different

171
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,590
elements as you can see calcium copper

172
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:19,269
zinc and iron in the lead and that has

173
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:23,079
been done simultaneously so basically

174
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:25,899
the the advantages of using XRF over

175
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,120
other imaging technique well first of

176
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,919
all it's incredibly sensitive right so

177
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,769
we can visualize micronutrients such as

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,230
copper which is present in plants and

179
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:38,109
really I mean it basically single digits

180
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,890
ppm and inverters even below ppm values

181
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,930
we can still do that also the excellent

182
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,699
feature to us of this technique and to

183
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,079
many is that it's not destructive so you

184
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,909
don't really need to prepare samples

185
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,889
well depending on the resolution you

186
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,720
want to study so you can just take you

187
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,209
what we do in a logistically if go to

188
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,120
the synchrotron in which we look at the

189
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:00,930
elements which is amazing it's very high

190
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,420
spatial resolution and we can analyze

191
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,569
pretty much all elements of the periodic

192
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,730
table and for us important elements are

193
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,399
copper iron and we also leaning more

194
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:17,590
toward things so how this technique

195
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:19,060
helped us so so we were wondering we are

196
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,619
working on a transporter called

197
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,689
oligopeptide transporter which was

198
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,500
initially identified in the gary Spacey

199
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,629
lab and it has been known that pocket is

200
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,490
free I'll refer to it as a PT 3 or

201
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,070
equilateral sport is somehow involved an

202
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,860
iron from their status but the substrate

203
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,750
of the transporter was unknown and the o

204
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,550
PT 3 itself the mutant has very

205
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,610
intriguing properties of which I'll just

206
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,829
wanna highlight one leaves over the

207
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,899
Apogee 3 mutant accumulate a significant

208
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,810
election amount of iron compared to the

209
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:52,049
wild type but here's the seeds of the

210
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:54,089
mutant contains significantly less

211
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,039
than the wild-type it was unusual

212
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,540
because typically sees get their

213
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,370
minerals from leaves and you would be

214
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,709
expecting that if leaves have so much

215
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,740
iron then seals would have so much iron

216
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,509
but yet it didn't happen and so to

217
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,350
understand like what's going on with

218
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:13,289
iron in the leaves we decided to use XRF

219
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,360
we want to see what maybe iron is this

220
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:17,120
is distributed differently in the leaf

221
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,419
of the mutant verse of the wild-type and

222
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,610
we collaborated with merle oberon on and

223
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,279
what we found we found that actually

224
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,659
Iowa is trapped in the vasculature of

225
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,789
the leaf of the mutants so what you're

226
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,949
looking here is the iron distribution in

227
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,829
the wild-type and it's mainly you know

228
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,500
it gets evenly distributed but with this

229
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,379
main localization in vasculature but

230
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,230
then when you look at them a leaf of pt3

231
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:45,289
mutant you can see that iron is

232
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,269
highlighted in this minor way okay so

233
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:49,980
it's trebs there so it's already led us

234
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,720
to the idea well I won't just cannot be

235
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,899
renewable I so that's why it's so high

236
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,600
in leaf and it's so low in seed and of

237
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,250
course we moved on to see well vascular

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,470
consists of xylem and the form

239
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,779
xylem that's the the westcoast issue

240
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,300
which delivers minerals from the root

241
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,889
and into the chute but then floor is the

242
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,349
tissue which is responsible for

243
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,449
mobilizing minerals and delivering

244
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,360
minerals from the sources such as the

245
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,310
leaves to think such as C so we analyzed

246
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
the iron concentration in xylem and the

247
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:22,919
phloem set and we found that actually

248
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,980
the xylem step hyper accumulates iron

249
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,929
while the form in the mutant has

250
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,149
significantly less iron so basically

251
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:31,649
what we are looking here is iron in the

252
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,259
xylem okay

253
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,360
and so next question was okay well

254
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,460
that's that's the mutant for pg3 so what

255
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
a PT 3 is doing and so the next step was

256
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,570
well we have to know where the opposite

257
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,909
localized it's an asylum is it in the

258
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,940
floor and because that can tell us what

259
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:50,519
it does is it's moving iron from the

260
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,060
xylem and then the Newton high

261
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,090
calculates it in the xylem or it somehow

262
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:59,199
moves iron from desire into the floor

263
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,830
and so it cannot slow the

264
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,900
to the floor and so just simplify the

265
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,250
story basically we found that repeat III

266
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,750
is localized to the floor

267
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,970
so the floor transporter and mutation of

268
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,490
which leads to the decreased

269
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,129
concentration of iron in this fluid and

270
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,820
then the final surface area of the cake

271
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,679
was actually finding that PT 3 is

272
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,170
actually an iron transporter and we

273
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,739
collaborators of you girls in arose from

274
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:32,049
USDA here and we showed together that

275
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,029
Apogee 3 van is well what you're looking

276
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:36,099
here is all sides and of us all sides so

277
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,959
we did some uptake studies in xenops all

278
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,139
sides and so a PT 3 is actually

279
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,259
localizers to the plasma membrane and it

280
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:48,129
can in turn or both sides and in Abydos

281
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:50,230
s photo class and it can move iron into

282
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:54,939
the also itself so what you see here

283
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:57,759
over time or PT 3 is black bar and you

284
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,070
can see that it has PT 3 expressing also

285
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,600
itself contain more iron than control

286
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:06,340
non expressing cells so basically this

287
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,930
helped us to understand

288
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,040
so basically accelerate was sort of the

289
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:14,139
first step forward to understand what's

290
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,669
happening to the to the opt three mutant

291
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,490
and why the Newton white a high

292
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:20,679
percolates so much iron in the leaf it

293
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,049
can move it into the seeds and basically

294
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,489
it's because the iron is strapped in the

295
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,250
vasculature and of course it's have to

296
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,960
combine extra refers other techniques

297
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:33,429
what we have done to fully characterize

298
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:36,009
a gene function and so what we sort of

299
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:38,529
hope for we hope data PT 3 and it's

300
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,480
homologs from crops skipped species can

301
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,819
be used for biofortification because a

302
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,529
PT 3 is responsible for loading of iron

303
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:51,370
into the seeds but that's next step and

304
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:54,159
now I sort of switch gears to copper and

305
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,009
again just to reiterate the point that

306
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,829
while copper is not as copper deficiency

307
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,169
is not as I spread for humans for the

308
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,820
plants it can be detrimental and in fact

309
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,250
well I teach mineral nutrition and I

310
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,560
teach any class that well hopper is

311
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,659
needed for fertility and we know that in

312
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,809
a field right so you can see a Naveed

313
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:16,659
we've grown on the really low copper is

314
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:19,559
infertile and you know and yeah but then

315
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:23,169
we never knew why popper is needed and

316
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,119
so and but however copper is toxic

317
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,189
together as I release toxic and

318
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,899
accumulate in excess so plant have to

319
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,640
really try to regulate copper from their

320
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,740
status to make sure that it has enough

321
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,699
you know to prevent efficiency but also

322
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:41,440
avoid toxicity and so this regulation in

323
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,480
the plant is achieved by the

324
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,480
transcription factor which belongs to

325
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,230
the family of SPL or as DP binding

326
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,670
domain the transcription factors SPL 7

327
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,889
Estill SEMO noted does like really

328
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,379
simple model of the experiment based

329
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:59,110
regulation of copper corner status and

330
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:02,740
the copper deficiency SPO 7 up regulates

331
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,710
expression of copper uptake and the

332
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,600
transporters and also genes encoding

333
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,970
transporters which is possible for the

334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,909
internal copper movement in a plant and

335
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,160
the second role is that SPO 7 up

336
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:17,529
regulate the so-called copper

337
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,469
reutilization system or we call it

338
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:23,199
copper economy system when plans try to

339
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,350
feed on their own reserves and just

340
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,570
metabolize they just get rid of less a

341
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,720
very abundant but on essential copper

342
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,240
protein and so delivered copper to much

343
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,450
more essential copper requiring

344
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,120
functions and so it is not surprised

345
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,740
that a spill 7 mutant of course it's

346
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,250
sensitive to low copper in the

347
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,430
environment and the point here that SPO

348
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,440
cell was the only transcription factor

349
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,889
which was known to regulate copper

350
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,470
homeostasis in vascular plants and so we

351
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,330
were very excited when a PhD student in

352
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,279
a lab ship a young she identified a

353
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,960
normal correspond to transcription

354
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,209
factor which we designated set one

355
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,180
copper deficiency youth transcription

356
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,769
factor one and of course the

357
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,079
bread-and-butter work writers have to

358
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,149
see whether you know if it's up

359
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,440
regulated it's copper regulated but

360
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,840
whether it has something to do with

361
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,470
regulating copper connectors we always

362
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,379
have to go down to the Newton and so

363
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,870
Jaffe

364
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:26,448
I like the mutant and she grows the

365
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,589
mutant in the presence of flow operand

366
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:29,838
what she found that under control

367
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,480
condition the mutant was looking pretty

368
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,820
much as a wild-type and here you can see

369
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,519
this is a mutant expressing the set1

370
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,740
genomic fragment so it's a complement a

371
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,230
complementary line but then under

372
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,180
corporate efficiency the mutant was

373
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,579
growing really poorly and also we

374
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:48,169
developed this korat export on mature

375
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,629
use which indicative of copper

376
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:53,479
deficiency and then the genomic fragment

377
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:55,549
can fully complement the mutant we also

378
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,560
found that this you know coppers

379
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,809
increased sensitivity to copper

380
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,078
deficiency as associated with the

381
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:06,708
decreased ability of the newton to take

382
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,448
up iron and move iron in a plant body so

383
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,399
for example here you can see that in the

384
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:12,289
root the fitment mutant has

385
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,448
significantly less copper than the

386
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:17,809
wild-type and it's pretty much true for

387
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:19,639
each tissue and also we analyzed flowers

388
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,888
because remember I mentioned that copper

389
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,810
was associated with somehow it was

390
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,669
always mentioned that copper is needed

391
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:28,039
for fertility and so they also analyzed

392
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:30,500
copper accumulation in flowers of the

393
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,419
mutant and headless and also what is

394
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,299
noticeable here that actually there was

395
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:42,169
some there was less seeds in a sink so

396
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:43,879
yeah and then next we decided to see

397
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,649
well is there a relationship between

398
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,870
this newly identified transcription

399
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,389
factor set 1 and the previously known

400
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,970
transcription factor still 7 and so our

401
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,948
rationale was that well if these 2

402
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,360
transcription factors they work in the

403
00:16:54,948 --> 00:17:01,338
same pathway then in a double mutant we

404
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,930
should see something like a still 7 like

405
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,870
phenotype which are the smaller growth

406
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:08,959
under well under limited copper

407
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:11,539
condition but that actually not what

408
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,130
happened initially while the action it

409
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,099
was difficult for us to find the mutant

410
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,020
was so tiny I took every year well

411
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,139
really literally took a year you were

412
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,970
looking for it and that you know we had

413
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,220
to tell were in fine group and we found

414
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,269
it well but the problem was adamant and

415
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,338
eventually died so that

416
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,529
the reason the phenotype was seedlings

417
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,089
and seedling ability that it took us so

418
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:36,319
much time to understand that actually

419
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:38,809
that's an issue and which meant that the

420
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,829
pathway is much more complexed so that

421
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:46,069
will be previously thought but then we

422
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:48,259
were able to rescue this seedling

423
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:50,480
lethality of the mutant with high copper

424
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:53,269
so again what you see here different

425
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,130
blunt lines wild-type set 1s bill 7

426
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,809
single mutants and the double mutant so

427
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,110
the mutant the double mutant now growth

428
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:03,259
well growth up to the reproductive stage

429
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,149
well it's smaller but it actually has

430
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:08,150
the same amount of copper as wild-type

431
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,950
all right so that was already for us

432
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,259
interesting right well it's smaller but

433
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,960
has the same amount of copper but then

434
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,819
what we noticed that although the mutant

435
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,559
the seeding utility is rescued and the

436
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:20,359
mutant growth the double mutant grow

437
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,549
through the reproductive stage the

438
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,089
double mutant is fully infertile well is

439
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,099
90% infertile so what you see here again

440
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:29,899
and and this is at 50 micromolar proper

441
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:33,889
which is really high with high non-toxic

442
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,470
equality so basically you can see other

443
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,960
geo dives are doing quite well but the

444
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,250
double mutant you know it's important

445
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,019
it's this is just elongated car pool

446
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,299
really to cut really long story short we

447
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:49,549
were able to detect that that's due to

448
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:53,029
Poland defect so that double mutant

449
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:55,309
produces like 90% less fallen Poland and

450
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,740
then of the Poland produced a more than

451
00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:00,349
20% of the Poland for Jews is enviable

452
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:05,180
so it's very very strong Poland

453
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:07,339
fertility defect but again this double

454
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,350
mutant has the same amount of copper as

455
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,179
other lines right and that was for us

456
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,279
very puzzling like what's happening

457
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,279
there right and of course you were

458
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,170
thinking well maybe there are a couple

459
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,779
of hypotheses one of the hypothesis may

460
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,920
be these two transcription factors they

461
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:24,230
coagulate

462
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,930
copper delivery to the specific flower

463
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,089
structures right that was other favorite

464
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,890
hypothesis although we could not exclude

465
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:32,539
the possibility that these are

466
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,940
transcription factors they can regress

467
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:38,539
so many other things in a plant and

468
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,039
maybe something to do with copper so but

469
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,740
we again we favored the first hypo

470
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,599
and so how do we do that and that's how

471
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,430
we turned again to XRF we thought we

472
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,339
have to really look where copper

473
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,769
localizes within the flower structures

474
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,990
and I want to emphasize it it was not

475
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,279
known before what we knew before what

476
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,440
the just copper is needed but we're

477
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,079
co-operators if at all the sepals is it

478
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,100
Unser's is it normal knew before it and

479
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,509
so at that time we already took

480
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,459
advantage from the fact that we have

481
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:10,279
synchrotron facility here at Cornell

482
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,650
so that's Cornell high-energy proton

483
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,609
sauce here Wilson lab and that little

484
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,530
hole okay

485
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:17,719
very convenient it just depending how

486
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:22,430
you go different routes budget

487
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,319
regardless why will it at most so their

488
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,240
postdoc in the lab do change here how

489
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,759
its engine they collaborated with the

490
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,420
wrong one and Arthur wall a chest and

491
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,089
together what we were able to find is

492
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,500
that actually the majority of opera if

493
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,990
you look at the flower and this is the

494
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,880
wild-type and what you see here is the

495
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,460
distribution the copper density the

496
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,460
majority of copper is really peaks at

497
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,140
the in amperes it also localizes it

498
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,690
Carlos but you know the majority is

499
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,460
still in amperes and then when you look

500
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,470
at the different Newton lines you can

501
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,829
see that well fit one is well it's

502
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,779
somewhat affected a still seven is more

503
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:02,409
affected but then the double of Newton

504
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:05,089
has barely detectable copper all right

505
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,370
then we also looked for other elements

506
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,379
you looked for iron and I mean it's a

507
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,969
long story while you look for iron but

508
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,980
it was very important enough to show

509
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,990
that it's not just so it's actually just

510
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,039
copper it's not iron and that's what we

511
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,299
see here that iron is almost no I mean

512
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,930
it's very it's not statistically

513
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,940
significant basically and so basically

514
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,769
what it allows us to show that copper

515
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,880
well first of all copper is localized in

516
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:34,940
answers and also in in Karpis and then

517
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,180
we can pinpoint that this pollen in

518
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,940
fertility defect of the double mutant is

519
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,940
actually associated with the inability

520
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,390
of the mutant to move copper into the

521
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,390
answers

522
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,389
all right and just to conclude this part

523
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:55,298
so basically it was known for for a

524
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:56,979
while that well flower development and

525
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,690
flower fertility is controlled by many

526
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,210
factors which include photo period and

527
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,580
hormone so using XRF you are first of

528
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,850
all able to identify which floral organs

529
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:09,099
contain winnows and also XRF allowed us

530
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:12,548
to put transition metals in this case

531
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:16,269
copper is very significant contributing

532
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:18,190
factor to plant fertility so where we're

533
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,778
going from here of course we are very

534
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,149
interested now to translate this

535
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:25,118
knowledge we gained in grow in in water

536
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:27,878
are a bit obsessed to crops right and so

537
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:32,470
via collaborating with mark so with mark

538
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:35,069
soros we are using meta population with

539
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,159
making population generated in mark's

540
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:42,970
lab with the hope to identify cutie else

541
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:45,070
which will sort of be associated with

542
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,519
copper delivery to answers fertility and

543
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:50,678
input yield of lead and what you see we

544
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,808
already started doing this work so what

545
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,019
you see here you are seeing florida off

546
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:57,999
to parental line and actually their

547
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,730
offsprings and what you're seeing that

548
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:04,028
two parental line they have different

549
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:07,269
they differ in accumulation of copper in

550
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:10,888
anthers and actually i know its identity

551
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:13,419
these two parental lines also differ in

552
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:15,668
annealed I mean mark can correct me if

553
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:20,470
I'm wrong but they and so it seems that

554
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:22,480
the the W 79 84 is low yielding variety

555
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,548
and it yet accumulate less copper in

556
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,378
answer and also what we see that there

557
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:28,538
is a segregation for copper accumulation

558
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:29,858
in answers and actually in all the

559
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:34,329
reproductive organs because this is

560
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:36,489
Karpis and in metal population so we

561
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:40,239
really hope that this this will lead us

562
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:43,329
somewhere we are also collaborating with

563
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:45,038
Susan McCool and we are trying to sort

564
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:48,398
of adopt this technology also to rise

565
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:51,999
and this is because semi-high throughput

566
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:56,699
so there so these are 15 mine in six

567
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:59,669
hours I'm talking about highfalutin

568
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,239
so these are seeds seeds of rice and

569
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:06,659
what it allows us to see in the

570
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:08,819
distribution of elements in in seed

571
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:11,100
tissues and the importance of a site

572
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,868
that I mentioned before the tribe is

573
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,089
really and all of the the majority of

574
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:18,118
cereal crop they have very low

575
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:20,308
concentration of Windows in grace but

576
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:21,868
rice is the worst and especially white

577
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:24,358
rice is the worse and the reason is that

578
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:28,439
the majority of winners especially such

579
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:31,949
as iron they accumulate in how in ll

580
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,350
layer and so the breeding should be and

581
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,470
all of them the goal would be to

582
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:40,769
actually to identify varieties that will

583
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,509
have either not you know and maybe think

584
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:44,519
and other elements not the other layer

585
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:47,128
and in the hull but actually moving iron

586
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,349
into the endosperm and so this is like

587
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:52,259
the first step forages of 14 after I

588
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:57,298
think 2000 lines which is that have been

589
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:59,579
generated in cereals lab and to conclude

590
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:01,710
overall this talk I hope I can sort of

591
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,319
convince you that XRF is imagining is a

592
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,858
really powerful tool one of the tools

593
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,319
that can help us to to infer the

594
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:12,808
function of genes in Mel Newton Khmer

595
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,628
studies and I really hope and we all

596
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:19,288
hope you this tool that it will help us

597
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:23,128
to breathe for better crops for safer

598
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:25,169
and more nutrient-dense crops and was

599
00:25:23,128 --> 00:25:28,980
that I would like to acknowledge me that

600
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:31,769
members so Jaffe she was liking honest

601
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,808
pure science at one proper project did

602
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,388
you change here and how its engine

603
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,190
they're they're they're two people in

604
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:40,648
the lab for really pushing forward this

605
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,139
XRF study and I would like to thank our

606
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:46,079
collaborators at the war and wrong one

607

610
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,368
Leone caution and of course the funding

611
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:56,788
and we have questions we have one

612
00:25:56,368 --> 00:26:00,058
question

613
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:01,890
Oh or we can take it outside and thank

614
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:05,078
you very much for the attention
