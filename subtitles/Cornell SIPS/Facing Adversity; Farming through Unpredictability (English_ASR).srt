1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,919
good evening everyone

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,278
i'm mike huffman one of the associate

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,920
deans in the college of ag and life

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,519
sciences and director of the

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,920
cornell university agricultural

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,640
experiment station the one in ithaca

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,519
and i welcome you to tonight's panel

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,760
conversation discussion uh title of the

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,280
program is facing adversity

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,960
farming through unpredictability

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
also known as climate change

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
it's a real pleasure to have

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,759
some esteemed guests on the panel

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
tonight

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,000
on this side they will uh i'll just

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,439
introduce them by name now later on

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,198
they'll provide more information about

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,119
their farm and background but paul

21
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,640
verscavich

22
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,439
jenny crist

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,439
and allison

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
so my task is to provide a background

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,400
sort of a

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,359
overview of the topic

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,960
and um with that oh

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,400
i'd like to acknowledge two people

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,359
before we get started and that's

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,719
jennifer benson and sharon dietzer both

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,478
from cal's alumni affairs and

32
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,239
development for helping organize all

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,239
this and get you all here

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,680
so let me provide a backdrop to this

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
topic

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
let's start with the basics

37
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,679
climate change just imagine the

38
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,599
atmosphere is a blanket

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
and it's just the right thickness it's

40
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,559
been that way for thousands of years to

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
retain

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
you have high energy sunlight coming in

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,280
reflected off the earth at a lower

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,599
energy it bounces back and forth just

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,879
like in a greenhouse so that blanket has

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,559
been optimal at about 270 parts

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,879
per million of carbon dioxide for

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
thousands of years and that's why we

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,039
have agriculture that's why civilization

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,359
is flourished

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,399
so keep that concept of the blanket in

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,799
mind and things are changing

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,800
if you look at the graphs on the right

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,120
those are graphs of the three primary

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
greenhouse gases carbon dioxide on the

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,400
top methane and nitrous oxide

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,280
and um

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,120
again the 270 parts per million is a

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
good thing it's kept everything just

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,560
where we needed to be to be where we are

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,080
today as a civilization however in 2012

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
we hit 394 parts per million that's a 40

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
increase

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,400
in that

65
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,719
of concentration of carbon dioxide and

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,200
that blanket is getting thicker

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,680
therefore things are heating up the sun

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,079
the energy is not radiating back up

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,319
this concept of greenhouse gases

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
several people in the 1800s one guy by

71
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,079
the name of jack kindle came up with

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
this concept it's pretty straightforward

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
he was he was my buddy in the high

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
school track it was fun

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,159
um but looking forward to the year 2100

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,599
it is likely we're going to have 900

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,919
parts per million

78
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
by that time and then if you look at the

79
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,799
scale

80
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,519
or that trajectory just imagine right

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,760
now at the top chart it says 360 but

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,319
that would go to 900 that's hard to

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,000
grasp but that's the direction

84
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,799
we are headed

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,080
as business as usual without making any

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
major changes in how we operate

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
some facts

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
global average temperatures are

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
increasing one and a half degrees

90
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,919
since the industrial revolution it's

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,080
getting warmer at the poles generally

92
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,598
warming twice as fast as near the

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,239
equator

94
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,280
and it's not uniform alaska has warmed

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,439
about 7 degrees western antarctic about

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,598
10 degrees

97
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,759
the hottest decade ever ever was 2001-10

98
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,679
last year in the u.s it was the hottest

99
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,840
year ever recorded

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
and we exceeded previous records by one

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
degree fahrenheit

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
summers are warmer

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,719
and longer

104
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,280
winter is warmer

105
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,959
and again business as usual

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
we are likely to hit eight degrees

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
fahrenheit

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
increase by 2100

109
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,639
just to put it in perspective the last

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,199
ice age was eight degrees colder

111
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,959
the evidence is all around us

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
in the middle if i'm sure you've heard

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,600
about this summer

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
loss of arctic sea ice

115
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,919
it's reduced about 40 percent from

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,560
historical records and if you think that

117
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,639
in area that's about the equivalent of

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
half of the continental u.s

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,280
which has always been reflective because

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,918
it's totally white now it's deep blue

121
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,879
ocean and can absorb heat there's a bit

122
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,120
of a feed

123
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,040
mechanism potential there

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
on the right glaciers are retreating

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
pretty much universally around the world

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,919
so why is that important hydroelectric

127
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,160
power 40 of bolivia's hydroelectric

128
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,359
power comes from melting glaciers for

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
example

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,479
in irrigation water

131
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
the oceans lower left

132
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,319
are

133
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,319
rising just an eighth of an inch a year

134
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,759
doesn't sound like much

135
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,240
most of the much good part of that is

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
simply water expands when it warms the

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,759
oceans are warming the water is

138
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,959
expanding the balance of that a good

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,199
portion of it is coming from more

140
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,959
from the melting glaciers and lastly

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,038
upper left anybody hiked been in

142
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,719
colorado in the last two three four

143
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,478
years in the mountains

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
well i'm an entomologist

145
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,918
and i thought this was amazing

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
because you'll know that's a photograph

147
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,399
i took but a good portion of the trees

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
are dead

149
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,519
the reason being

150
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,079
long-term drought

151
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,599
warmer winters warmer summers and bark

152
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,800
beetles love it

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
and

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,680
the scale of that is amazing it

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,439
encompasses about 78 000 square miles

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,639
from the southern tip of the rockies up

157
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,759
into british columbia and british

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
columbia there is where there are no

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,120
trees left for all dead

160
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,198
okay so kind of a global picture we're

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
gonna bring it down to the state

162
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
so we have challenges more extreme

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
weather floods droughts high temperature

164
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,079
stress new pests hey things are cool the

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
southern insects are gonna again i'm an

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,159
entomologist job security

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,918
but we'll have new invasive species and

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
it's basically getting less predictable

169
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,719
there's more variability

170
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,639
on the other hand we have some

171
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
opportunities we'll have water in this

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,439
part of the country

173
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,120
longer seasons warmer seasons what can

174
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,038
we do with that and if you look around

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
the world around just in the u.s other

176
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,318
parts of the country are going to be

177
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
under greater stress agriculture in

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
california for example

179
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,080
the precipitation patterns in the

180
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,000
sierras is shifting towards more rain

181
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,399
during the winter instead of snow so

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
there's no banking of a reservoir

183
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,478
of water to tap during the summer and

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
then throw in san francisco los angeles

185
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,199
and a lot of competition for that water

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
but again it positions us here a little

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
kind of on the upside

188
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,799
um

189
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,039
recently well this the scale of this is

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
from 1870 to now each of those bars

191
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,719
represents a decade

192
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,598
and you can see an increase in heat

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
stress the degree days over 90 degrees

194
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,719
fahrenheit

195
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,959
and likewise the right side increase in

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,240
heavy rains this is two inches in 24

197
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,560
hours

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,478
the bar on the far right is 2010.

199
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
so lots of challenges but then back to

200
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,959
the opportunities potential to expand

201
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
and diversify agriculture new crops new

202
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,680
varieties

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
winter canola we're growing that in

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,519
northern new york for first 19 1990 you

205
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,359
could not do that

206
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,038
california's grape industry is suffering

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
especially in san joaquin valley because

208
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,959
of the high temperatures are getting too

209
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,758
high sugar content on the other hand

210
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,159
this opens up opportunities for us

211
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
double cropping and we have markets 30

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
percent of the us populations out here

213
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,478
in this part of the country and can we

214
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
market this local grown lower carbon

215
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,279
footprint produce good for job creation

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
economic development

217
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,519
but what do we need to adapt

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
uh better decision tools for our

219
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,240
producers

220
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
when does it make sense to put

221
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,960
additional cooling in a dairy facility

222
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,279
because hot cows produce less milk

223
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,878
when should i switch to a new crop

224
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,119
water management is going to be a big

225
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,720
deal either too much or not enough so

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
when do i put in additional tiling when

227
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
do i buy irrigation equipment and

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
there's communication strategies among

229
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,638
farmers educators and researchers and

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,639
clearly communicating to policy makers

231
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,478
there's adaptation to these changes but

232
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
then we can't forget about mitigation

233
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,758
which is reducing our carbon

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
contribution to the atmosphere

235
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,720
greenhouse gas emissions so on farm

236
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,038
increased energy efficiencies

237
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
using less fossil fuel

238
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,158
waste conversion to heat anaerobic

239
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,639
digestion

240
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,399
reduce tillage cover crops and improve

241
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,559
nutrient management are all ways to

242
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
mitigate the impact of agriculture on

243
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,759
climate change

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
so trying to pulling some of this

245
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,080
together

246
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,080
the summary more uncertainty more risk

247
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,240
in the future there's opportunities to

248
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
mitigate and adapt

249
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,639
agriculture in new york state is

250
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
positioned

251
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,720
to expand and diversify

252
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,079
and we have the capacity look around at

253
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
our farmer community cooperative

254
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,080
extension cornell other institutions

255
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,000
and as you will hear from our panelists

256
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,759
farmers are on it they're researchers

257
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,958
they're making decisions every day on

258
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,639
new varieties so we're going to hear

259
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,479
from both

260
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,600
both of the producers on what they're

261
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
doing

262
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
to adapt and lastly there are activities

263
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,278
in response to this there's new

264
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,278
initiatives across the state at cornell

265
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,759
i've been involved for two years in a

266
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,919
joint pro effort with canadians directly

267
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,919
to the north that somehow climate change

268
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,719
and international borders there's it's

269
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,319
insignificant so they're looking to see

270
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,800
what opportunities they have by the way

271
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,760
75 for their population lives in eastern

272
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,519
canada they've got incredible markets um

273
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,200
we recently started this institute for

274
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
climate change and agriculture cornell

275
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,720
there's some new reports out

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,879
and clearly cooperative extension as

277
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
alison will describe is a resource and

278
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,919
again i'll turn back to our own

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
producers as a resource of new

280
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,759
information

281
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,720
so with that uh return to the panel i

282
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,240
think jenny's going first

283
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,759
and we're gonna if you don't mind we'll

284
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,759
hold questions until the end

285
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,879
hello

286
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,560
um

287
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,559
my name is jenny crest and

288
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,319
um i

289
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,559
i work with my parents on our apple

290
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,959
orchard in the hudson valley it's

291
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:35,039
does that sound about right okay

292
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:37,439
it's uh it's about 600 acres

293
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,439
and

294
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,720
we we actually have about eight

295
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,479
different non-contiguous locations some

296
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
are closer or farther away from the

297
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
hudson river

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
and they have varying altitudes also and

299
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,920
so we get to observe some of the

300
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,640
different climatic impacts

301
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,639
but anyways

302
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,359
i

303
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,759
i sort of categorize some of the

304
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,519
different ways that the changing climate

305
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,439
affects us

306
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,919
via earlier springs hotter summers

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,160
milder winters a longer growing season

308
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:14,199
and more severe storms so i'll just go

309
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,199
through each of those things

310
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,639
so earlier springs there's been a lot of

311
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,278
press about the the frost and how it

312
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,958
damaged the apple crop this year um

313
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,360
there's different ways it damaged the

314
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:28,159
crop you can see the

315
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,159
which one's the point

316
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,838
um

317
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,159
the those apples are actually dead

318
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,920
they're brown inside those are the baby

319
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,240
apples um but then there can be scarring

320
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,199
the quality issues on apples that are

321
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
actually

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,879
you know reach harvest maturity

323
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
um

324
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,759
and that's all because you know the

325
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,078
apples are much more prone to frost once

326
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,759
they're at a susceptible stage so if the

327
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,519
springs are earlier because we have a

328
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,759
mild winter

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,320
and this past winter we started seeing

330
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,240
spring in march then the

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,000
the apples reach a susceptible stage

332
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
much earlier in the year

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,200
and we're more

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
more more prone to the cold weather

335
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,519
and actually

336
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
dr

337
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,480
uh art degatano has done some research

338
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,720
about um

339
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
the the killing frosts that have been

340
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
occurring

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,879
and

342
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,120
he's predicting that

343
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,600
the the frost risk is going to increase

344
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
through time um and

345
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
there's probably going to be we

346
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,278
categorize it by 10 percent kill or 50

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
percent kill or 90 percent kill of the

348
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,639
apples

349
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,720
but there's probably going to be

350
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,399
about the same number of 10 kills but

351
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,000
more 50 and 90 kills um

352
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,320
just because of the variability of the

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
weather

354
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,679
so

355
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
um

356
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,439
so anyways ryan and i on the way up

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
we're trying to figure out the ryan's

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
our firm credit loan officer and we're

359
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
trying to figure out the uh

360
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
the

361
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,120
the difference in yield between a good

362
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,039
site and a poor site and how much extra

363
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,200
you could afford to pay for a good site

364
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,879
over a poor site to prevent against

365
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
frost um

366
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,320
and so

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
it's very interesting this year we

368
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,600
actually

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,679
we we could really see the difference in

370
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
a good site and a poor site a good site

371
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,838
had pretty much a full crop like maybe a

372
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,679
thousand bushel per acre and a poor site

373
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,120
could have so little that we didn't even

374
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,399
bother to pick it um so almost zero

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,278
um

376
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,679
but anyways we we averaged like 500 or

377
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,078
500 bushel per acre difference and if

378
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,679
you take an average market price in a

379
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,439
good year when there's a short crop of

380
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,559
14 per bushel

381
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,000
and then take out your variable costs so

382
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,679
do a 30 gross margin that's about 2100

383
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,440
dollars

384
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,719
just for the difference in yield not

385
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
even counting the difference in quality

386
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
and that's really interesting because

387
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
when you go to purchase a new site you

388
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
might want to take that into

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
consideration

390
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
as far as what you're going to what

391
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
you're willing to buy an acre for and

392
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,719
what you're planning to grow because the

393
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,320
frost event won't occur every year but

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,759
if it occurs once every 10 years

395
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,600
or if it occurs you know twice in 20 you

396
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,039
you might want to figure that in the

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
2100

398
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,120
and then you can add the quality

399
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
contribution on top of that too

400
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,320
uh there's some more examples of hilltop

401
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,720
sites in the hudson valley

402
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,839
planting on the hills

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,480
um the other thing we do for for uh

404
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,320
frost before i get to the summer part um

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,440
once you know when there is a frost

406
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,600
coming we we have a wind machine

407
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
we've also tried out some helicopters

408
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
the helicopters are are really hard to

409
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,439
manage

410
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,839
it's a less consistent result and you

411
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
have to work closely with the pilot

412
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
my dad had a lot of fun with them in the

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
middle of the night last week last

414
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,278
spring

415
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,039
but it's very expensive it can be three

416
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,120
hundred dollars to a thousand dollars

417
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,919
per hour um

418
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,959
being on standby can cost a lot of money

419
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,799
um and then you really need to we had

420
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,638
them work up the hill so as it got

421
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,599
colder three nights in a row in late

422
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,278
april they moved up the hill to cover uh

423
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,079
the higher and higher ground as we gave

424
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,838
up on the lower ground but in the end it

425
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,120
was really hard to measure the benefit

426
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,120
that they did or didn't give

427
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,560
and we were frustrated with our ability

428
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
to get the helicopter right where we

429
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,039
wanted it we would have preferred to

430
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,039
drive it ourselves

431
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,240
but um

432
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,078
the

433
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,600
the wind machines are a more consistent

434
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,519
result and we can see the difference

435
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
between the areas that we didn't didn't

436
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,679
have the wind machine at similar

437
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,639
elevations

438
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,958
and they cost about 30 to 40 40 000 to

439
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,278
install and they can maybe protect about

440
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,119
10 acres but then they also require a

441
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,600
significant amount of fuel but those are

442
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,278
becoming more techy which is interesting

443
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,199
you know you can have them

444
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,360
come on automatically when it reaches a

445
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,679
certain temperature and things like that

446
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,039
if you get the newer the newer kind so

447
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,599
those are some different things some

448
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,278
different options to consider

449
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,159
and it of course it all depends on the

450
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,679
specifics of the night about whether the

451
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,759
there's an inversion because if there's

452
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,679
no warm air up above it doesn't help too

453
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
much

454
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,638
but and then there's also the

455
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
consideration about crop insurance um

456
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,360
if you

457
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
first of all we think it's a really

458
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,039
important thing to buy crop insurance

459
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,679
but then there's a you know the

460
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,639
different levels you can choose um and

461
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,159
if you have crop insurance your the

462
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
amount you're willing to invest in a

463
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,240
helicopter or in a wind machine is

464
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,799
probably a little less than if you

465
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,159
didn't have crop insurance and ryan and

466
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,439
i tried to figure out what that level

467
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,679
was too but it's really tricky

468
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,320
so because there's a 50

469
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,719
deductible on the crop insurance and so

470
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,480
it gets really hard to figure but

471
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
it'd be easier if you knew exactly what

472
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
temperature it was going to be that

473
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,879
night and exactly what impact that would

474
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,480
have on the crop

475
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,318
um

476
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,480
but then so hotter summers um

477
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,318
as mike was saying you know we have we

478
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,078
have longer hot spells

479
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,838
the heat waves are more intense and more

480
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,558
frequent an increased frequency of

481
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,000
drought um

482
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,439
i had to make sure my dad wasn't going

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
to be too embarrassed if i showed these

484
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,919
pictures

485
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,400
this is raw on honeycrisp and

486
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
it's it's caused probably by a few

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,360
things but especially by sunburn which

488
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,440
allows the rot spores to get in

489
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,359
it damages the surface of the apple and

490
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
kind of cooks it

491
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,639
but that can be

492
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,400
aggravated by a lack of water also

493
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
and actually the surface temperature of

494
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,440
the apple can be 30 degrees higher on

495
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,440
hot days than the air temperature so if

496
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,919
it's 100 degrees out the surface of the

497
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
apple can be 130 degrees

498
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,600
and so that

499
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,678
that's a lot of stress especially on

500
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,359
this delicate variety but we've also

501
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
only been growing honeycrisp for about

502
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,759
10 years so it's not something we've

503
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,798
seen a big change in over the course of

504
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,558
the climate change discussion

505
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,599
but it is something we factor in with

506
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,160
the

507
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,159
the warmer summers

508
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,719
so

509
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
one thing that we do is you know a lot

510
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,319
of drip irrigation just to relieve the

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
stress on the trees because you can see

512
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,480
the the high density plantings that

513
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,000
we're transitioning to in the apple

514
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
world

515
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,440
this is a second leaf tree on the tall

516
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,480
spindle terence robinson's new planting

517
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,798
style from cornell and so they those

518
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,558
trees were planted the previous growing

519
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,000
season and you can see the apples on

520
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,639
them which is pretty amazing and there's

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
a drip line in there

522
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
but there's not a huge root system and

523
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,880
those little trees are already producing

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
fruit and so they really they really

525
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,120
need the support of the water to grow

526
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,160
the tree and also to grow the apples and

527
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,798
there's a lot of research

528
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,798
that the more

529
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,160
the the more stress there is on the tree

530
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,558
the more stress there will be on the

531
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,679
fruit and the lesser the the quality of

532
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,160
the fruit

533
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
and the yield that's another block that

534
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
that block is older probably like five

535
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
or six years old

536
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,879
and you can see there's there's just not

537
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,319
a lot of tree structure there for the

538
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,440
amount of fruit and so you really have

539
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,439
to keep the water applied

540
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,720
so the other thing uh that's interesting

541
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
you can irrigate of course overhead for

542
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,798
uh

543
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,959
for frost frost control freeze control

544
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,519
and in washington they also overhead

545
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,079
irrigate uh they do evaporative cooling

546
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,400
to cool down the fruit and prevent loss

547
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,918
of water in the orchard on the hot days

548
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
so we're thinking of trying something

549
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,480
like that on our honeycrisp but

550
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
um on a high value crop of course

551
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,798
honeycrisp sold this year for like 80 a

552
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,279
bushel in a normal year a good uh bin of

553
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,960
cider apples is like ninety dollars for

554
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,440
you know a whole bin

555
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
but honey crisper a high value high

556
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,960
value crop

557
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
um

558
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,439
um we're also with the hot summers

559
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,439
experiencing with our experimenting with

560
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,440
some sun protectants they're mostly

561
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,279
calcium based it's kind of like a

562
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,200
sunscreen on the apple i don't have any

563
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,720
pictures of that but

564
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,038
you just have to be really careful that

565
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,360
it will wash off and it can also

566
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,879
impact color development on the apple

567
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,399
we've tried it on a lot of honey crisp

568
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
and some of the color hasn't developed

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
quite the same

570
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,440
but it needs to wash off otherwise it

571
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,199
looks like the apple has spray all over

572
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,679
it even though it's just calcium it's

573
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,798
not very appealing to the consumer

574
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,320
um

575
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:47,918
anyways the the milder winters is the

576
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,678
the next uh next thing and i guess the

577
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,679
the milder winters impact us a little

578
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,080
bit less they're on average four degrees

579
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,240
warmer than the 70s according to cornell

580
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,319
we do have to wait a little bit longer

581
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,798
for the trees to harden off if we start

582
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,319
with a milder winter before we start

583
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,639
pruning this year and last year we

584
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,879
waited at least a month longer before we

585
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,960
started our serious pruning

586
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
because a if you make a big wound in the

587
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,679
tree

588
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
before it's hardened off you can get

589
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,038
winter injury when it cools down

590
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,600
also the milder winters can encourage

591
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,319
the deer population this is our new deer

592
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,639
fence we put in last winter

593
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,079
it's eight feet tall we saw a deer jump

594
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,440
over an eight foot tall fence so don't

595
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,240
do a six foot tall one

596
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,880
if you're gonna do it but it cost about

597
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,798
fifteen thousand dollars a mile we did

598
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,720
seven miles of it

599
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,000
and we figured out based on the area

600
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,079
that was enclosed it was about six

601
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,519
hundred dollars an acre but it can

602
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:49,199
impact production like by about 25

603
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,359
we have a farm that's had a deer fence

604
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,440
for a number of years and we just saw

605
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,279
the production climb up and up in the

606
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
years after the deer fence was installed

607
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,279
so we're pretty big believers now four

608
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,120
of our locations have deer fences in the

609
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,119
return on investment for a deer fence

610
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,879
so this is one of the nice things about

611
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,558
climate change we have a longer growing

612
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,840
season and we never thought we could

613
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,359
grow pink ladies before but we can um so

614
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,480
these are

615
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,558
in their

616
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,440
third leaf i think and

617
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,119
we we have beautiful pink ladies

618
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
the one thing that we've experienced

619
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,119
with them is because of the longer

620
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
growing season the insects have more

621
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,000
time to get to them and you have to end

622
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,079
the summer disease and you have to

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,880
protect those apples longer

624
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,480
some insects can have a third generation

625
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
that didn't used to have a third

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,960
generation as you have a longer

627
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,360
growing season

628
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,519
so we have to keep staying on top of

629
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,519
that

630
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,240
we also 20 years ago we never thought

631
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,918
we'd grow fujis but we've been fuji's

632
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
are actually harvested before pink

633
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
ladies so they're a no-brainer now but

634
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,919
as it gets warmer they can grow them

635
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,199
more in western new york and other areas

636
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
farther north

637
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
so

638
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,079
um

639
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,199
and then

640
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,399
the uh

641
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,759
the last thing

642
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
um

643
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,679
these are

644
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,319
i i believe more severe storms are

645
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,000
associated with climate change and i'm

646
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,599
not sure if that necessarily means hail

647
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,558
but there is more rain and more wind um

648
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,399
and

649
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,519
this is what can happen if your trellis

650
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,480
system isn't good enough on a hill

651
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,599
and then

652
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,319
my dad ends up doing that

653
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,240
as long as the tree can be salvaged but

654
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,918
one thing we've learned is with you know

655
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
as we switch to these higher density

656
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,320
plantings that we really need a

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,839
a stronger trellis system that will hold

658
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,000
that kind of weight

659
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,158
especially when we get these high these

660
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,240
high wind storms and

661
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
the soggy ground and the shallow root

662
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,919
system on a big hill like i showed you

663
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
at the beginning so

664
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,759
we really have to build for that

665
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,200
um

666
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,200
one of our jamaican guys told us we

667
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,080
weren't thinking very much when we set

668
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,120
these up

669
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,279
um and then hail of course um i'm not

670
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,719
sure if that's particularly associated

671
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,038
with climate change but it tends to come

672
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,038
with strong storms sometimes and there's

673
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:18,960
not an awful lot we can do it about that

674
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:21,519
unfortunately um except to diversify our

675
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
locations that's one reason we have uh

676
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,200
so many different locations and we're

677
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,919
spread out it might be more convenient

678
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
to be on one spot but it diversifies the

679
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,000
risk a little bit and then the the crop

680
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,599
insurance is really

681
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
really really important when it comes to

682
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,599
hail

683
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,759
so

684
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,759
in summary

685
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,440
i guess the most important thing is to

686
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,919
invest wisely in your sites for

687
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
elevation and air drainage but also for

688
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,038
water

689
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,879
because as we

690
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,558
you know have bigger longer droughts or

691
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
hotter summers and want to use

692
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,158
evaporative cooling we need to have the

693
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,759
water available

694
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,679
and really think through carefully it

695
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,200
might sound like a big number per acre

696
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,038
that you

697
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,038
would would have to invest to have the

698
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,440
nicer site but it might be worth it

699
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,200
especially looking at climate change

700
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,278
um and if you can

701
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,679
diversify in location to spread your

702
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,720
risk that's also very important for

703
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,960
severe storms

704
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,120
and then invest wisely in your plantings

705
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,079
too choose the the site carefully to

706
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,158
match uh match the variety so like we

707
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,399
put our pink ladies on the southern

708
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,640
facing slope on this farm farthest to

709
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,880
the south and we put our honeycrisp that

710
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,038
suffer from the the heat we put them on

711
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,640
the north facing slope on the farm nor

712
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,798
farthest in the north

713
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,400
so between choosing the varieties that

714
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,480
the market wants and then placing them

715
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
carefully on your different locations to

716
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,880
have the best

717
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,038
the best return it's really important at

718
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
ten thousand dollars or more per acre by

719
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,319
the time you set it all up you can't

720
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
afford to make a lot of mistakes

721
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,480
planting

722
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,640
buy crop insurance

723
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,919
and then carefully consider the the

724
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
frost control measures um

725
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,880
and in the end i mean a lot of the

726
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
things that

727
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,559
i talked about with the climate change

728
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,240
they're good management practices in

729
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,839
general and things that

730
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,720
farmers have been doing for a while we

731
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:16,158
may need to do them more frequently now

732
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,000
or to a larger a greater degree

733
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,120
but i just wanted to point out that

734
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,798
climate change it's a risk that we face

735
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,119
we're dealing with it step by step it's

736
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,359
a gradual change but there's a lot of

737
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,038
other risks that factor into business

738
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,719
management

739
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,879
you know one of our biggest business

740
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,360
risk right now is having an affordable

741
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
and legal labor force and willing labor

742
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,879
force

743
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,960
and then you know it's great we have

744
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,039
cornell and extension we

745
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,919
uh and they help us through you know

746
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,839
these climate change issues and um

747
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
the hudson valley lab is there for us

748
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,038
every every spring when we're

749
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,599
confronting things like the frost and

750
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,720
giving us the heads up on on everything

751
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,319
but

752
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,640
they send daily emails and are always

753
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,399
available but the research on the stink

754
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
bug and

755
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,798
some of the different insects and the

756
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,599
extended life cycles of the insects

757
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,440
is really important so um

758
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,199
we're we're glad that cornell's there

759
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,679
for us so

760
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,558
um and that's it

761
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,559
i'll pass it on to paul

762
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,360
okay uh yeah my name is uh paul

763
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,599
roskowicz i'm a fourth generation onion

764
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,678
grower from orange county new york i

765
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:39,359
farm in partnership with my father

766
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,360
and you know thinking about uh

767
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,599
you know different weather patterns and

768
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
farming through unpredictability i

769
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,038
thought i'd just share some of the

770
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,159
experiences that we've had over the last

771
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,558
two years because weather has certainly

772
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,159
had an impact

773
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,119
in our area

774
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,760
not so much for the good

775
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,759
so i think i'll

776
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,679
start off well back up a little bit i

777
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,519
mentioned i'm an onion grower that's

778
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,640
primarily what historically what we've

779
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,599
grown

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,759
however

781
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,240
two years ago we started growing

782
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,960
some winter squash

783
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,640
and pumpkins and we've grown some corn

784
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,640
and soybeans on and off over the years

785
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
so anyway

786
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,440
i'm going to start with last season

787
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,440
2011.

788
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,119
last season was an extremely wet year

789
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,880
right from the beginning it seemed like

790
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,038
we were fighting the wet

791
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,520
all season long we had some onions that

792
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,839
we planted it was so wet they rotted we

793
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,720
ripped some up we planted squash

794
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,798
um

795
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,798
and all season long stayed wet and then

796
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,440
of course that was uh

797
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,158
ended in august by hurricane irene and

798
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
tropical storm lee where we had uh

799
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
eight to nine inches of rain in less

800
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,038
than 24 hours and with the soil already

801
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,158
being saturated of course we flooded

802
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,960
um

803
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
on our farm we lost uh about 85 percent

804
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
of the crop

805
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,639
um dollar value somewhere around three

806
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,398
hundred thousand so uh need to say it

807
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,240
was a pretty hard hit

808
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,839
uh there were some growers in valley who

809
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,359
lost their entire crop so

810
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:17,759
um um one one advantage uh that i did

811
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,439
have last year is uh

812
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,679
i planted about eight acres of squash

813
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,600
and upland uh outside of the muck so of

814
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,278
course that didn't flood and that was

815
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,119
the only squash i ended up

816
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,960
selling last year

817
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,639
so uh as a

818
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,480
result this past summer um 2012

819
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
i did grow some more squash and upland

820
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,558
we had approximately 20 acres

821
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,759
um

822
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,759
and of course that presents other

823
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,519
challenges with wildlife uh you know

824
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,240
jenny mentioned challenges with deer we

825
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,798
had deer and woodchucks um

826
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,120
which did quite a bit of damage on uh

827
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,119
i had one four acre field is the poor

828
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,199
location because uh right next to it was

829
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,599
our uh neighboring dairy farm we had his

830
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,159
uh his bunk silo so the

831
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,678
the deer would go to the eat some silage

832
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,679
and they'd come into the squash field

833
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,120
and then he went down the hill and onto

834
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,880
the muck and ate pumpkins so

835
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,759
anyway i won't i won't be uh growing

836
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,760
that field next year

837
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
but

838
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,199
anyway

839
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,959
this growing season was actually a

840
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,000
fairly decent growing season and started

841
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,919
off a little on the dry side

842
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,398
but we were able to get an early start

843
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,720
it was a good growing season until we

844
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,599
got to the fall and this fall was

845
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
extremely wet

846
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,038
which resulted in serious quality issues

847
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,678
in our onions

848
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,679
seems the the first onions we harvested

849
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,360
were very good but anything harvested

850
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,120
after a certain date

851
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,319
just sort of broke down

852
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,158
and

853
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:54,558
we had a lot of waste and um

854
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,000
not only that but the weather stayed wet

855
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,639
for so long we didn't have any good

856
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,759
drying air to to help dry the crop so

857
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,759
that contributed to it

858
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,120
also uh this year with squash um

859
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,359
we did have a an early frost very hard

860
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,839
frost in early october so i probably

861
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,678
lost um about 12 acres of butternut

862
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,240
squash some of the other squash was a

863
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,919
little heartier so that was all right

864
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
but we did have a lot of

865
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,200
problems harvesting just because of wet

866
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,480
weather

867
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
not only because of the weather but

868
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,399
we're also faced with a

869
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
labor shortage

870
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,798
i know it's tough around the state but

871
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,880
particularly in orange county uh we had

872
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,558
a difficult time getting uh labor in the

873
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,640
fall to pick so

874
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,480
uh you know normally i can line up day

875
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,320
crews come pick squash when it's ready

876
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,319
to be picked um but this year i had a

877
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,240
hard time finding day crews and then

878
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,398
days when i could get a crew and it

879
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,759
ended up raining and couldn't pick

880
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,359
so um

881
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,519
that was a challenge

882
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,199
um and looking back at you know some of

883
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,919
the quality issues we had with onions i

884
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,038
think

885
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,880
a lot of that

886
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,158
stems from last year

887
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,320
with the flooding anytime you have a

888
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
flood you have all kinds of bacteria

889
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,158
and other pathogens

890
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,119
coming in with the flood waters

891
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,880
and

892
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,959
on top of that we had a very mild winter

893
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,840
last last winter so

894
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,679
things didn't freeze

895
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:17,918
to kill a lot of the pathogens as you

896
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,240
normally would have if you had a nice

897
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,679
nice hard freeze so this one we've had

898
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,000
some cold weather i'm hoping we get some

899
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
more

900
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,640
so

901
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,959
anyway

902
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,320
thinking ahead to next year

903
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,798
i'm going to be cutting back some on

904
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,798
squash

905
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,880
i'm not so much worried about the

906
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,440
weather as i am

907
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,799
about labor with the squash because

908
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,480
you know you can grow it but if you

909
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,480
can't get it picked it doesn't do you

910
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,798
any good

911
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,278
i'm also going to be uh

912
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,200
growing some more corn and soybeans

913
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,240
one thing i've noticed you know you talk

914
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,080
about

915
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,519
warming temperatures and opportunities

916
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,278
for new crops

917
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,599
i'd say you know 10 years ago you

918
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,319
probably saw very few if any soybeans

919
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,759
grown in orange county

920
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,519
i know just this past summer there's

921
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,720
been at least two grain bins that have

922
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,960
gone up

923
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
around the county so uh there's there's

924
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,759
quite a few

925
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,200
more acres of soybeans uh being grown

926
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,359
um

927
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,240
and uh i will also

928
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:26,398
continue to grow uh some on up land uh

929
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,399
although not as much um

930
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,000
and uh sort of to to summarize things uh

931
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,038
you know thinking about

932
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
um

933
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,679
you know severe weather patterns and

934
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,000
just

935
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,960
farming through unpredictability uh i

936
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,038
think

937
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,200
um you know whether you're dealing with

938
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,879
climate change or not mother nature is

939
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,278
always going to throw you a curveball

940
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,399
even in a normal year whatever that is

941
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,159
anymore

942
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,839
um

943
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,760
and so i think

944
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,359
it's uh you know one thing i've learned

945
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,200
it's good to be at least a little bit

946
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,519
diversified so that you can spread your

947
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
risk out over more than one crop when

948
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,599
you have all your eggs in one basket

949
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,199
uh particularly with a high value or a

950
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,039
crop like onions where you have uh

951
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,239
pretty high input costs

952
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,480
um

953
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,398
it's good to diversify a little bit

954
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,398
and also i think uh in general you just

955
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,199
need to be

956
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,799
willing and able to uh adapt to change

957
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,039
um

958
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,159
particularly to um unpredictable events

959
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,719
whether it be

960
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,398
weather related or regulatory or or

961
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,959
whatever so

962
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,838
um that i think i'll turn it over

963
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,838
thank you

964
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,440
well good evening my name is alison

965
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
jotharchon and i'm from dutchess county

966
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,119
cooperative extension

967
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,358
and i think we're gonna pull up my talk

968
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,358
here

969
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,679
great thank you so thank you for having

970
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,640
me here um

971
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:03,358
is there this is the clicker yes okay

972
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:07,759
so i thought i'd start off with a short

973
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,759
video and i might have to hit the

974
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,358
so i've been very fortunate to be

975
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,279
working half time

976
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,159
for the last

977
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,760
almost two years on a new initiative

978
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,838
that we're very fortunate that helene

979
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,960
dillard this is a production of cornell

980
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,119
university

981
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
can we

982
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,400
okay so i've been working on a new

983
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,920
statewide cooperative extension team and

984
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
this

985
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,159
is

986
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,000
providing halftime funding for five

987
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,519
educators around the state we have

988
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
someone working on agriculture

989
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,199
specifically mary reggae in oneida

990
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,079
county

991
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,279
my focus on is on climate change and so

992
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,160
i've been working with cornell

993
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,400
university faculty to develop new

994
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,319
outreach materials on climate change to

995
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,119
bring them out to our extension

996
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,680
audiences and so this is one of the

997
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,000
new mechanisms that we're using to reach

998
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,519
out to farmers

999
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,760
and i'm only going to show a little bit

1000
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,079
of it this is a production of cornell

1001
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,800
university

1002
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,760
we've been very lucky on fishkill farms

1003
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
not to

1004
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,079
have any severe effects from the big

1005
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,800
storms of

1006
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
last year

1007
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,799
but our neighbors have certainly had a

1008
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,880
lot of trouble across the river in

1009
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,599
ulster county there was tremendous

1010
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,800
damage and it's not only from

1011
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
the irene

1012
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,160
uh

1013
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,519
storm and the hurricanes it was also

1014
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,319
um

1015
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,920
there have been wind and hail events

1016
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,119
throughout the last couple of years that

1017
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,400
have periodically caused cause

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,800
and the october snowstorm um knocked

1019
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,800
over a lot of trees as well so

1020
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,839
and broke a lot of branches

1021
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
so yes there have been quite a few

1022
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,880
events

1023
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,519
that are quite severe and we're seeing

1024
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,838
you know big swings on the

1025
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,280
the rainfall side as well between

1026
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,358
drought and

1027
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,720
prolonged periods of

1028
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,279
extreme

1029
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,799
extremely heavy rainfall

1030
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
just that just gives you a brief

1031
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,680
overview and we did hear from jetty and

1032
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,599
she's a similar uh fruit orchard farmer

1033
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,759
in the hudson valley the reason i show

1034
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,838
that is that we're just starting

1035
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,760
new ways of reaching out to farmers and

1036
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,759
doing some of these short video clips

1037
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,640
that we'll be posting on

1038
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,520
climate change website at cornell so i

1039
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:35,199
think it's important to keep this

1040
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,559
nifa priority in mind that as we see a

1041
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,639
changing climate

1042
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:43,119
we need to help our agricultural system

1043
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,480
help our farmers adapt to a changing

1044
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,240
climate

1045
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,960
while maintaining their economic

1046
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,719
vitality and so that's what our program

1047
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,639
work team is doing at cornell and our

1048
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,799
statewide team

1049
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,118
and so i think it's also interesting

1050
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,359
there was a recent study of farmers done

1051
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,400
at iowa state university it could be

1052
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:05,519
possible to do a similar study of

1053
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
attitudes of farmers in new york state

1054
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,960
to

1055
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,519
really understand scientifically what

1056
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,440
their knowledge is of climate change and

1057
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,280
in iowa actually 66 percent of farmers

1058
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,440
indicate they believe climate change is

1059
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,599
occurring however only eight percent

1060
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,760
believe it's caused by humans uh 35

1061
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,320
believe it's equally caused by humans

1062
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,440
and natural causes 25 percent due to

1063
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,240
natural causes so really while it is

1064
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,240
positive that 66 percent of farmers

1065
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,199
believe that climate change is occurring

1066
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,199
now we do still have some work to do in

1067
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,519
our communication and our outreach in

1068
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,159
providing the research that's taking

1069
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,800
place at cornell out to the stakeholders

1070
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,118
that we work with and so i mention our

1071
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,519
new statewide energy and climate change

1072
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,079
team i would encourage you to contact

1073
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,838
your local educators in your local

1074
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,440
office talk to your cooperative

1075
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,320
extension boards

1076
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,400
boards of directors and your agriculture

1077
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,039
agents see if they've gone through

1078
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,960
training and if you have questions about

1079
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,759
extreme weather events they can

1080
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,559
certainly contact our team or or contact

1081
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,359
researchers or cornell

1082
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,679
i've been working with what i mentioned

1083
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,239
is a program work team on climate change

1084
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,078
and this really is just a mechanism

1085
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,319
where faculty

1086
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,240
our staff and our extension educators

1087
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,800
can come together

1088
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,199
usually in person twice a year and then

1089
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
we have

1090
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,719
communications and other

1091
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,679
work teams that are working on

1092
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,319
committees and this allows us to

1093
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:45,519
better communicate to each other about

1094
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,838
research about funding opportunities we

1095
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,480
recently submitted an epa environmental

1096
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,519
education grant that will provide a

1097
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,240
funded

1098
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,280
climate change education for several

1099
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,519
different

1100
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,320
enrolled volunteer programs including

1101
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,079
master gardeners so we hope that kind of

1102
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,720
collaboration will help bring more

1103
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,480
funding to cooperative extension into

1104
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,039
cornell researchers

1105
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,519
and i mentioned that we're we have been

1106
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,719
working on new communications

1107
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,800
outreach we've been at empire farm days

1108
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,519
at the new york state fair we've been at

1109
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,320
fairs like the duchess county fair

1110
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,480
i did a similar talk for our

1111
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,160
agricultural breakfast where we had 100

1112
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,838
people in the room to talk about extreme

1113
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,679
weather and i think you're going to see

1114
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,400
an increase in this type of

1115
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,919
communication from cooperative extension

1116
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,800
and so

1117
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,800
i'll end with

1118
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,639
some win-win benefits that i think both

1119
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,679
of our producers talked about that

1120
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,319
really

1121
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,039
taking on some of this work to start

1122
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,640
thinking about climate change is

1123
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,000
good

1124
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,639
for farmers because it can reduce risks

1125
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,199
and help prepare for extreme weather you

1126
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,039
can take advantage of the opportunities

1127
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,358
that michael mentioned

1128
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,358
you can improve your operations and

1129
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,920
upgrade infrastructure and there are

1130
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,480
several incentive programs

1131
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,599
for new york farmers through nycerta

1132
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,519
and you can

1133
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,760
contact cooperative extension if you

1134
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,920
have questions about that

1135
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,400
we can help promote local sustainable

1136
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,200
economic growth through

1137
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
local food systems biofuels and

1138
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:29,279
production agriculture here in new york

1139
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,679
and help support our communities and

1140
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,680
become more sustainable in upstate new

1141
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,279
york and throughout new york state

1142
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,039
and with that

1143
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,560
this is a production of cornell

1144
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,480
university

1145
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,279
have you seen any local effects of

1146
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,119
extreme weather and and climate change

1147
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
in in the years especially especially

1148
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,280
because you you're native here to

1149
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,200
dutchess county uh yes i have it seems

1150
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,480
like the

1151
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:56,719
winters are getting much milder

1152
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,240
we're getting more i think more severe

1153
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,838
weather as we head

1154
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:05,759
south seems to be getting more snow more

1155
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,759
cold winters are not nearly as bad

1156
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,199
we've had three major weather events in

1157
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,318
the last couple years one two years ago

1158
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:17,439
the excessive snow throughout the winter

1159
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,318
last fall with the uh you know being hit

1160
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,880
by

1161
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,838
tremendous amounts of rain the hurricane

1162
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,680
and then this winter with i don't

1163
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:30,318
ever recall a winner of this uh

1164
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,679
as easy as it was i've gone through

1165
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:35,358
snowless winters but never with as mild

1166
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,358
as it's been we didn't have a winter

1167
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,598
actually and we didn't have a winter and

1168
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,559
i see

1169
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:45,838
a lot less hay was fed a lot less hay

1170
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,000
was used uh

1171
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,679
which is you know a double-edged sword

1172
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,280
it's good for those that didn't have to

1173
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,318
buy hay but it's

1174
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,359
poor for those of us that sell high

1175
00:42:54,318 --> 00:43:00,239
or it's it's an issue uh

1176
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,400
what the insect population

1177
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,358
and the

1178
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,920
bad

1179
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,838
bugs that weren't killed uh

1180
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,159
in today's paper there was a major thing

1181
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,159
about uh

1182
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,920
you know lyme disease being

1183
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,799
you know perhaps the

1184
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,000
banner year for lyme disease so i'm i'm

1185
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,079
really

1186
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,599
concerned over what's coming down the

1187
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,880
road even though i can't

1188
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,960
predict

1189
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,440
i can only hope that things won't be as

1190
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,358
dire as they may be

1191
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,280
what happened to your farm during the

1192
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,799
extreme weather events and how much

1193
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,680
money you think

1194
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,440
you lost how did it affect you

1195
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,759
uh

1196
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,358
of course it started in in april last

1197
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,720
year with the fact that we had so much

1198
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,639
trouble getting the crops in uh

1199
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,118
just you know we got them seated and we

1200
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,199
couldn't go even go back and roll them

1201
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,559
roll them pick up rock

1202
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,039
uh

1203
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,519
which in turn we probably got a poor

1204
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,599
catch a seed than we should have

1205
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,920
so that that bothered us you know just

1206
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,838
little little things that

1207
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,079
you know don't always add up the fact

1208
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,960
that you have to send

1209
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
people

1210
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,240
again and again back to the field

1211
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,680
because there's big wet spots you have

1212
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,519
to go around and stuff like that it

1213
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,919
takes a lot more time

1214
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,759
we lost probably half our old crop

1215
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,400
because we couldn't get it we couldn't

1216
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,240
harvest it in the window that we had it

1217
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,240
went down we lost a lot of it

1218
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,759
the biggest thing that's bothering me

1219
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:36,639
right today is that we left probably

1220
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,400
fifteen thousand dollars worth of hay

1221
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,239
uh

1222
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,280
second cutting grass hay in the field

1223
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,479
that we could not harvest last fall

1224
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,359
we made

1225
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,599
many attempts we got some in but we knew

1226
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,358
a lot of hay so we we left fifteen

1227
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,160
thousand dollars with the hay in the

1228
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,639
field which is really financially

1229
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,719
bothering me right now strapping me

1230
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,719
uh we lost a field of corn

1231
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
that was

1232
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,199
you know a lot of it was management

1233
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,440
fault for not chopping that field we

1234
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,679
left it for grain thought we could get

1235
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,000
it and we got the late

1236
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,799
snowstorm and it was very tall corn and

1237
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,039
it took it down so we lost

1238
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,560
we lost a lot of corn over there so we

1239
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,719
probably lost

1240
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,920
a minimum of forty thousand or solid

1241
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,598
crops

1242
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,480
you can as a farmer you can

1243
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,200
you can weather the storm

1244
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,159
but you can't weather continuous storms

1245
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,919
uh you can you can take it on the chin

1246
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,159
you can uh

1247
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,400
you know you you come back spring brings

1248
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,799
eternal hope and that's as a farmer

1249
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,880
that's what's that's what fuels me

1250
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,440
that's what you know as i

1251
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,920
as i become alive i mean this winter you

1252
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,159
know and

1253
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,079
as the warm weather comes you we all

1254
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,960
feel like doing more and as a farmer

1255
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,960
it's just so much easier you know we we

1256
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
think again this year i have this

1257
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,559
probably a skewed vision that this is

1258
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,559
going to be the best year ever

1259
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,838
so that's a nice way to end hope springs

1260
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,119
has been a production of cornell

1261
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,519
university

1262
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,920
so i we are doing these video short

1263
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,000
video clips as a way to

1264
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,880
have farmers speak to farmers and they

1265
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,719
will be up on the cornell

1266
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,240
climate

1267
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,559
change.cornell.edu website and we're

1268
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,719
hoping to engage other cooperative

1269
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,279
extension educators around the state to

1270
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,679
go out and do the you know talk to their

1271
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,280
farmers and and the farmers that they

1272
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,440
work with and capture some of more of

1273
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,400
these videos so that you know we're not

1274
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,400
the ones

1275
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,800
out there preaching to farmers but they

1276
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,039
can talk to themselves and these are

1277
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,880
some of the resources that we have

1278
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,759
available there there were fact sheets

1279
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,640
out in the front and with that um we're

1280
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,839
gonna

1281
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,838
have a conversation i think

1282
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,838
you i guess i admitted i was an

1283
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,838
entomologist earlier

1284
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,280
i'll make a few assumptions that the new

1285
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,680
conditions weather etc are aggravating

1286
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,280
pests in general so if we have a similar

1287
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,118
set of circumstances then i wouldn't be

1288
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,720
surprised if it happens again

1289
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,559
that's the best i mean obviously i can't

1290
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,199
predict the weather but

1291
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,440
uh it's these

1292
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,279
unusual wealth wet spells coal spells

1293
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,720
whatever interacting together and that

1294
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,240
sometimes it's just like i mentioned the

1295
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,000
bark beetles you know just perfect and

1296
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,039
insect populations take off it could

1297
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,440
also be

1298
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,119
i don't think that's migratory but i

1299
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,318
mean we're also having new storm fronts

1300
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,440
come through that also bring in pests

1301
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:50,800
yes claire

1302
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,400
um

1303
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:58,800
well this is on everyone hear me um

1304
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,599
yeah it's it's always been a challenge i

1305
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,560
think uh communicating with uh with

1306
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,800
consumers um there seems to be a

1307
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,639
you know a growing disconnect between uh

1308
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,880
the farming community and and the rest

1309
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,879
of the community um especially as

1310
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,119
there's fewer and fewer farmers

1311
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,800
um but one one thing i did notice last

1312
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,039
year with a hurricane

1313
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,240
um being that we had such extensive

1314
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,079
damage in orange county uh the local

1315
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,679
community and consumers really really

1316
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,519
took notice

1317
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,879
of uh you know what we were going

1318
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,599
through and

1319
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,599
you know they did a

1320
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,318
number of community events they did a um

1321
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
sort of a local uh farm aid

1322
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,199
uh

1323
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:43,519
in the community and i think they they

1324
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,118
started out with the goal of raising 20

1325
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,440
000 by

1326
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,039
the 20th of whatever month it was

1327
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,639
and uh

1328
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,759
they ended up raising uh just over a

1329
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,920
hundred thousand um and they they

1330
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,480
had a big event um sort of an

1331
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,838
educational event um where the community

1332
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,358
could come in you know talk directly to

1333
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,920
farmers they had you know various

1334
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,639
exhibits uh set up so i think

1335
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,680
um it took an event like that where

1336
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,440
consumers at least locally um

1337
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,679
took notice of what what the farmers in

1338
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,240
the area were going through but

1339
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:18,239
yeah it's

1340
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,760
it's

1341
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,440
well there you know the frustration of

1342
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,880
trying to communicate um

1343
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,760
our problems and

1344
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,000
not not only our problems but how uh

1345
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
how produce gets to the shelf and

1346
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,159
you know even though we have a severe

1347
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,558
shortage locally it's always going to be

1348
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,719
there in the supermarket and um

1349
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,519
and also there's it seems to be one

1350
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,719
thing i did notice

1351
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,719
you know there's this myth out there

1352
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,639
that all farmers get subsidies

1353
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,239
and crop insurance i was talking to

1354
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:51,838
somebody you know they mentioned crop

1355
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,679
insurance they said well don't you have

1356
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,440
crop insurance says well yes i do say

1357
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,919
well did you get anything from that i

1358
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,200
said yeah we received about i think 80

1359
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,800
000 from

1360
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,318
crop insurance and he said wow that's

1361
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,318
quite a bit of money

1362
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,159
i said yeah but our seed bill alone was

1363
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,679
120 000 so

1364
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:08,480
it's very

1365
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,558
and

1366
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
you know that was a shock to them um so

1367
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,839
i think um

1368
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,039
i don't know it's a challenge jenny i

1369
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:15,838
don't know

1370
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:16,800
um

1371
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,119
i know

1372
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,519
uh we were we were pretty careful when

1373
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,920
the frost first came not to say too much

1374
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,400
to the papers because you never know the

1375
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,960
extent of the damage and you don't want

1376
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,720
people to write off the farm markets and

1377
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,720
not to come so

1378
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,000
we actually were pretty conservative in

1379
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,799
how much we told that story

1380
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,639
and

1381
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,720
just as a side note my parents were out

1382
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,239
in washington state about a month ago

1383
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,719
and that's the number one apple

1384
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,318
producing state in the u.s and

1385
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,078
they were just delighted out there

1386
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,639
because they're filling into our markets

1387
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,519
they were just dancing around with joy

1388
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,239
but

1389
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,400
it's not entirely bad we do have a food

1390
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,399
system that can can handle the

1391
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,119
variability and the different you know

1392
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,440
the climates and the different geography

1393
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,880
and we don't have to go hungry but

1394
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,880
it is a little scary for next year's

1395
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,880
markets

1396
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,119
i wouldn't say i don't worry about it

1397
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,800
because uh of course i do i think every

1398
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,559
farmer worries about it

1399
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,519
um

1400
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,760
but

1401
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,599
you know like you're saying uh like i

1402
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,359
mentioned diversification i think uh

1403
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,119
particularly with more extremes in

1404
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,558
weather the more you can diversify

1405
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,680
yourself you spread that risk out a

1406
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,480
little bit

1407
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:33,199
in other words if i i plant

1408
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,440
fewer acres of the more intensive crops

1409
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,679
such as onions and squash

1410
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,000
i can grow corn soybeans there's a

1411
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,000
little bit

1412
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,519
less input costs there plus you don't

1413
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,318
have the labor aspect of it

1414
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,000
and

1415
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,039
i think you know with today's grain

1416
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,400
prices those crops have been

1417
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,318
a little bit more profitable than they

1418
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,639
have been in the past

1419
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,079
so i think diversification is part of

1420
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,759
that

1421
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,359
but i think you know as any farmer knows

1422
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
you have to

1423
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,558
you have to be willing to accept risk

1424
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,759
because if

1425
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,559
if you didn't

1426
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,960
um well you wouldn't be in this business

1427
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,960
i know

1428
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:15,759
years ago my grandmother was a great

1429
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,358
cross stitcher and she uh she did this

1430
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,720
one sampler and said

1431
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,440
if you think there's gambling in las

1432
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,118
vegas just try growing onions

1433
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
all around the borders they had thrips

1434
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,599
and disease and all the different things

1435
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,079
that can that can can affect the

1436
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,920
onion drop so

1437
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,920
right it's part of the game i guess

1438
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,079
um i don't know if i have a good answer

1439
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,760
i i guess uh it's true i think it's

1440
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,119
becoming more and more capital intensive

1441
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,280
all the time and there's always new

1442
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,400
technology we have an electronic defect

1443
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,079
sorter that picks out apples with marks

1444
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,160
you know spots on them now on the

1445
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,920
packing line electronically which is

1446
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:59,118
pretty cool but it's also pretty

1447
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,159
expensive and we also have a or we would

1448
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,318
like to get a half a million dollar

1449
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,000
internal defect sorter that shines light

1450
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,838
through every apple and sees if there's

1451
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,039
browning on the inside

1452
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,920
but that's a pretty expensive price tag

1453
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,440
um

1454
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,838
and it at some point i think it'll

1455
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,559
become just something we have to have to

1456
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,159
market our you know certain crops in the

1457
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,480
springtime when there's a risk of

1458
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,118
internal browning after long-term

1459
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,800
storage and customers will just expect

1460
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,200
that we you know that we're able to

1461
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,960
detect that so it's pretty scary i mean

1462
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,439
i think it's one reason we really need a

1463
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,960
strong crop insurance program

1464
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,760
i know it's you know it's not always

1465
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,519
enough but it's at least it keeps you

1466
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,880
from having to dig out of quite such a

1467
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,480
big hole

1468
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,800
because you can't afford

1469
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,000
you know next year we want to invest in

1470
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,480
the next thing we don't want to dig out

1471
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,318
of last year's hole so

1472
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,838
you know you're dealing with an

1473
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,318
insurance program where you have to take

1474
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,679
the first 50 of the loss so that's i

1475
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:57,039
mean

1476
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,639
you'd be crazy if you bought an

1477
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,159
insurance program like that for your car

1478
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,199
or your house because it just just

1479
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,558
wouldn't work

1480
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,679
um

1481
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,200
you know i think

1482
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,719
you know maybe crop insurance has come a

1483
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,078
long way but i think it probably has a

1484
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,078
long way to go yet before it's uh

1485
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,519
an effective tool um

1486
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,200
you know like for onions we buy crop

1487
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,280
insurance because

1488
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,399
if you don't have insurance you don't

1489
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,839
qualify for any type of disaster aid

1490
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,160
should that come down the line

1491
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,838
um you know i mentioned you

1492
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,239
you have to take the first 50 of loss

1493
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,519
you can buy up at substantially higher

1494
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,118
premiums um but that just

1495
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,119
my opinion doesn't pay either i've

1496
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,119
talked to some growers one year

1497
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,800
i know i talked to one grower

1498
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,519
the payment he received didn't cover his

1499
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,519
premiums so

1500
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,079
how was that how was that an effective

1501
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,078
tool

1502
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,919
i'm not sure i think even though i

1503
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,440
wouldn't like to spend the extra money

1504
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,358
we might have to just to ease the

1505
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,358
variability

1506
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,880
just like if you were to have a fire you

1507
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,799
know you buy fire insurance every year

1508
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,240
but hopefully never have a fire

1509
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,000
um

1510
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,078
i i don't know i sure wouldn't want to

1511
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,440
pay 60 more because it's already pretty

1512
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,880
expensive but

1513
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,440
um

1514
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,200
i think i think we might have to um

1515
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,519
either that or ask farm credit to

1516
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,639
capitalize losses you know in the years

1517
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:18,639
when they

1518
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,639
i guess you can do it either way maybe

1519
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,879
depending on your banker

1520
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:26,078
well i know a number of years ago i was

1521
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,079
reading an article somewhere and

1522
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,679
the they're trying to make the point

1523
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,280
that

1524
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,639
one way or another

1525
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,240
consumers are going to have to pay more

1526
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,400
for their food whether they pay more at

1527
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,318
the grocery store or they pay higher

1528
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,559
continue to pay higher subsidies because

1529
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,239
uh you know like i said that

1530
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,480
the capital that goes into agriculture

1531
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,558
these days is uh you know pretty intense

1532
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,880
and that then again goes back to the

1533
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,559
disconnect between consumers and farmers

1534
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,798
a lot of consumers just don't

1535
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,960
understand what it what it takes to uh

1536
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,000
to grow a crop or to produce food these

1537
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,798
days

1538
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,039
um

1539
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,960
i i think my parents and i usually see

1540
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,519
pretty eye to eye on it

1541
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,079
actually we just fixed a fixed our

1542
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,599
interest rates on a couple of of our

1543
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,039
bigger loans

1544
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,599
and we were pretty much in agreement

1545
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,599
about that

1546
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,720
you know we try to

1547
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,280
manage some risk and

1548
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,240
leave some you know leave some variable

1549
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,200
um on the interest rates but then

1550
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,039
um on the cropped crop side too you know

1551
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,838
you buy crop insurance but it's still a

1552
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,798
risky business

1553
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:33,920
um so

1554
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:37,199
i i guess we just look at the the

1555
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,200
benefit that we could have from from uh

1556
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,598
from trying to mitigate some of the risk

1557
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,679
and then the cost of doing that

1558
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,680
um

1559
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,199
i think

1560
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,039
you know uh

1561
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,960
perception of risk kind of varies not

1562
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,279
only throughout generations but also

1563
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,960
throughout individuals um

1564
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,960
because i remember taking farm

1565
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,119
management and college you know talking

1566
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,559
about how uh

1567
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,798
you know as the older generation

1568
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,400
progresses they get less willing to take

1569
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,960
on risk whereas the younger generation

1570
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,039
is is more willing um

1571
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,119
in case my father

1572
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,279
uh i'm not so sure that's true he's

1573
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,680
still he's still willing to roll the

1574
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:20,960
dice every year and uh i know he's uh

1575
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:23,519
he's always been forward thinking and

1576
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,400
looking ahead to uh next year and i know

1577
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,798
over the years he's probably made it

1578
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,400
several sacrifices to uh

1579
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,599
you know keep us going probably for my

1580
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,280
benefit

1581
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,559
um so and

1582
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,920
you know like jenny mentioned it's

1583
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,119
important to have a good working

1584
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,599
relationship

1585
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,240
you know we talk constantly discuss

1586
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,640
these things so um

1587
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,159
it's i i think it varies a lot

1588
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,318
between businesses and between

1589
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,920
individuals

1590
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,558
we try to work out all the numbers and

1591
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,639
then take a look at it and

1592
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,839
make a decision i'm glad that my parents

1593
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:59,039
still make some of those decisions

1594
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,039
because they're kind of tough ones

1595
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,920
yeah it's sort of an interesting debate

1596
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,599
i don't know but i think we ought to

1597
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,200
have that debate oh absolutely um i

1598
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,798
you know there's i don't think anyone's

1599
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,078
gonna argue that we're we're not seeing

1600
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:12,880
more uh

1601
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,480
uh

1602
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,280
extremes in weather because we certainly

1603
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,519
are

1604
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,480
um whether you know you

1605
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,400
you believe that's due to uh

1606
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,880
global warming climate change or if it

1607
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,400
just seems to be a

1608
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,720
a cycle in a

1609
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,000
much larger macro sense

1610
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:31,118
i think there's still a lot of debate

1611
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,679
there

1612
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,280
um but

1613
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,279
yeah i mean we need to continue to have

1614
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,798
that debate because uh you know whether

1615
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,359
or not

1616
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:44,559
climate change is real uh or how much of

1617
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:46,480
it is uh man-made i think it's uh it's

1618
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,839
certainly having an impact on

1619
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,798
agriculture

1620
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:49,920
and

1621
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:51,119
i think you know we're gonna have to

1622
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,440
respond to it

1623
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,798
in some way i don't know

1624
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,720
if we're gonna have electric tractors

1625
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,239
but i think just uh

1626
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,239
agriculture in general is getting more

1627
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,679
efficient you feel costs are going up so

1628
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,639
of course we're gonna burn

1629
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:06,159
um

1630
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:08,000
look for ways to burn less anyway

1631
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,598
yeah i think a lot most farmers are

1632
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
driven to be efficient by nature um just

1633
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,480
you know to save on costs i also worry

1634
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,719
that if we have a lot of regulations

1635
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,639
imposed on us about climate change

1636
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,078
that that we will be less able to

1637
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,480
compete with the rest of the world and

1638
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,280
like like you were saying before

1639
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,519
you know

1640
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,798
mexico and china they'll backfill the

1641
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,400
food industry

1642
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,000
they'll keep the grocery store shelves

1643
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,960
full

1644
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,639
and

1645
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,240
probably what they're doing won't be as

1646
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,639
environmentally sound as what we were

1647
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,558
doing before so we just we have to be

1648
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,719
very careful what we impose on our

1649
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,119
farmers i think

1650
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,959
but that said i i mean there's maybe

1651
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,079
things we should be doing but

1652
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,920
maybe it should be more on an

1653
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:56,240
encouragement level than regulatory

1654
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,240
we actually had a farm three hours to

1655
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,118
the north of us uh when i was a little

1656
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,598
girl

1657
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,680
my parents did because macintosh grow

1658
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,000
better up north

1659
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,159
but we struggled because transporting

1660
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,239
them back down without bruising was was

1661
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,159
really difficult so we we sold the farm

1662
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,118
after a few years i think

1663
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,519
um

1664
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,680
but yeah they we we thought about that

1665
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,599
and now we're just tearing macintosh out

1666
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,318
but we found a new a new strain that

1667
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,400
grows better the ruby mac but

1668
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,639
when we've talked we haven't ever talked

1669
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,798
really too much about doing that again

1670
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,558
because we tried it the one time when

1671
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,358
we've talked about relocating it's been

1672
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,720
more a discussion about labor

1673
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:36,719
than about climate change

1674
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,358
yeah that

1675
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,200
that's

1676
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:45,679
i i think probably does make some sense

1677
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,239
diversify geographically to

1678
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,399
farm in various locations however uh

1679
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,358
um from a management side it gets to be

1680
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,720
be very difficult um you know if you're

1681
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,159
i you know i have no one grower he's uh

1682
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,078
this year i guess he's growing some

1683
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:03,039
squash down in the dominican republic so

1684
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,119
he's flying back and forth and i just

1685
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,880
can't imagine the

1686
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,880
the headaches and the costs associated

1687
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,079
with some of that i mean certainly

1688
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,079
there's advantages but

1689
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,798
it's it's a tough thing to do

1690
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,400
it's enough trying to handle one

1691
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,480
operation

1692
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,079
in one country

1693
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,400
try and spread that out

1694
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,760
okay thank you all and let's give a

1695
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,760
round of applause to our panelists

1696
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:43,879
this has been a production of cornell

1697
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,880
