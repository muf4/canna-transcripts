1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,320
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,320
university

3
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,240
so helping our students step off the

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,959
hamster bill writing as an approach to

5
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,039
foster reflection this presentation will

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
be talking about reflections why it

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,119
matters

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
how we've lost it and how to use some

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,159
tools to incorporate reflection into the

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
classroom based on center for teaching

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,439
excellence

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
assistance that i've gotten so what is

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,119
reflection

14
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,839
i'll use the definition causing to

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,878
consider action in an effort to engage

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,120
in a process of continuous learning

17
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,039
so i want to emphasize continuous

18
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,439
whether we're riding a bike or sitting

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,198
in a cornell classroom we're reflecting

20
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,599
on our learning sometimes without even

21
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,759
being conscious of it and that involves

22
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,000
asking questions like what happened what

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,560
was my response how do i make sense of

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,359
it how does it relate to other stuff i

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
know

26
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,400
what can i conclude and i find this to

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,519
be important what might i do differently

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,840
next time so this is ongoing i really

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,560
appreciate the words of john dewey

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,880
educational visionary who pointed out

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,040
that we don't learn from experience we

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,599
learn from reflecting on it

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
so given the importance of reflection

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,759
and that it's ongoing and it's a part of

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
our learning it makes sense that we

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,879
would deliberately include included in

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,040
our teaching experience in the classroom

38
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,158
it's so important

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,159
to our you know learning experience i

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,479
appreciate this student's perspective

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
she said i have a difficult time talking

42
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,000
about myself and i don't often pause to

43
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,919
consider my strengths and weaknesses she

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,239
went on to say that reflection really

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,280
impacted her because she was applying

46
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,280
for jobs and this helped her think about

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,159
her strengths and weaknesses put her

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,400
best foot forward let's pull that word

49
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,120
out of her quote for those words don't

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
often pause i don't know about you but

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,120
it seems to me that none of us are

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,680
pausing these days we're doing and doing

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,599
and doing without causing in fact it

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
almost seems as if we've grown

55
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,799
uncomfortable that not we're not doing

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
we're doing so much we're too busy in

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,080
fact tim kreider and the busy trap had

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
this to say almost everyone i know is

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
busy they feel anxious and guilty when

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,159
they aren't either working or doing

61
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,159
something to promote their work they're

62
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,799
busy because of their own ambition or

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,359
drive they're addicted to busyness and

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,879
dread what they might have to face in

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
its absence

66
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,039
does this sound familiar to any of you

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
and again i don't think it's just our

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,000
our university students i think it's all

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
of us it's a cultural problem

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
we're all doing too much we have too

71
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,639
much on our plates i think about one

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,199
student it broke my heart what she had

73
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,479
to say about all of this

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,119
she went on to tell us that in her view

75
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,598
i'm no longer able to express myself as

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
i once did because i'm too tense and too

77
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,719
critical to let myself go i lost the

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
flow somewhere between the labs and

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,280
all-nighters and term papers and prelims

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
to the point where it's extremely

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,640
difficult to bring myself either to

82
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,799
tears or satisfaction this is not what

83
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,719
we want to see in our student body and

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,719
one way to change it up a little bit is

85
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,878
through writing i want to point out

86
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,959
reflective writing is deliberate it's

87
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,318
intentional it's not just accidental

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,878
they're not just sort of writing about

89
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,798
whatever or keeping a diary it's a very

90
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,199
deliberate part of the classroom

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
experience it's important that we stage

92
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
it that way to get the most out of it

93
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,438
for our students

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
this includes well-planned rubrics clear

95
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,120
guidelines sample writings of what we

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,199
want to see

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,438
prompts that help students know what it

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,759
is you're trying to pull out of them and

99
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,560
then in class experiences that can

100
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,000
support that out of class writing and

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,318
reflection

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,039
this is a very deliberate approach let's

103
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,959
talk about rubrics so a good rubric

104
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,680
focuses on learning

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,959
improves the clarity of the feedback

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,959
reinforces our expectations and i really

107
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,560
appreciated this this semester with a

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,758
team of tas enables multiple graders to

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,759
evaluate work really consistently across

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,600
the board

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,240
students can use a rubric to assess

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,000
their own work rubrics engage students

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,478
in the learning process

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,478
and so they can describe what's expected

115
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,599
of them and ultimately we hope this

116
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,599
improves their motivation i have sample

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
rubrics if they're of help to anyone

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
feel free to take a look have them over

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,159
on the table

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,960
i'd like a developing scale because what

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,039
i'm after is the development of student

122
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,599
writing over time i want to see that

123
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,759
growth and we use three points for

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
reduced subjectivity if you have a group

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,960
of graders in particular we're going to

126
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,279
agree on one two or three whereas one to

127
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,959
ten might be really challenging and be

128
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,879
more subjective

129
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,959
guidelines are important too and they

130
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,360
ought to begin with why why are we doing

131
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,638
this reflective writing is for students

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,639
not for us

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,360
and it helps them identify their

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
challenges and areas of ambiguity and

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,879
really sort out what they're learning

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,519
and it also connects back with the

137
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,319
rubric so these two together are very

138
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,240
robust and very powerful

139
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,399
sample writings kind of show students

140
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,319
exactly what you're looking for from

141
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,560
them you can offer a here's a high

142
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,399
quality paper here's one not so much and

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,879
here's one that really is a reflection

144
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,679
at all so they can see exactly what's

145
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,680
expected of them if they and you are new

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,038
to reflection this could be very very

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
helpful

148
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,560
um meaningful props are important too

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
what they do is offer an assignment

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,680
often one of depths students can sink

151
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,399
their teeth into then help them step

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,400
back and assess the classroom experience

153
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,719
what they're reading what they're doing

154
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,239
in labs the whole

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
classroom

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,840
dynamic so you're giving them a really

157
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,038
toothy time and then just some other

158
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,918
considerations to support reflective

159
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,399
writing

160
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:27,120
occasional in-class free writing pausing

161
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,879
after 10 or 15 minutes of presentation

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,399
having them write right right and then

163
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,478
hand it in to you

164
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,399
can have you see how they're assessing

165
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,318
what's happening in the classroom can

166
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,799
almost be a dialogue to let you know

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
what they're really grasping peer review

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,680
is helpful as well

169
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,758
so from this presentation i realized i'm

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,319
going to put my money where my mouth is

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,479
and the last two slides i'd like you to

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,080
just pause for a moment and then this

173
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,560
very quick six minute presentation just

174
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,719
reflect on what did you get out of it

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
what resonated with you

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
anything new or surprising

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,598
anything that didn't resonate with you

178
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,839
just pause for a few moments and think

179
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,038
about you know what what did you get

180
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,038
from your presentation

181
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,038
thank

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,560
start

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,800
a couple of questions i want you to

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
think about who you are as a teacher

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,160
that's american reference or pretty one

186
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,240
an informational textbook

187
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,720
manual are you nothing more than a book

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
are you an unput adaptable

189
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,160
masterpiece when you teach

190
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,679
or are you something a little more

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
extraordinary

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
as a teacher

193
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
i want to talk today about literacy and

194
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
it builds on what marsha was talking

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,199
about it's like we had this plan um but

196
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
just a little background what we do is

197
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
work with folks who want to be public

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
school teachers for us that's important

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,038
because public high school students will

200
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,519
soon be our students and we have this

201
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:35,360
thing called common core state standards

202
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,799
adopted by 46 states across the nation

203
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
they ask students to read and write

204
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
differently than they ever have in the

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
past up to 70 percent of that reading

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,399
and writing at the

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
senior level will be informational text

208
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,039
with a task like that

209
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,920
where students read a couple of articles

210
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:55,360
about biofuels for example and then have

211
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,599
to find one other source of their own

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,200
take a stand on the issue and then write

213
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,040
a policy paper to a local policy maker

214
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
scores will be based on things like the

215
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,159
position the comprehensiveness the

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,278
support organization clarity fluency and

217
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,039
then editing for grammar and usage

218
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,439
and this is one of our teachers that we

219
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,599
work with amazing how

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
my students immediately jumped into it

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,759
read it we're excited about being asked

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,519
to approach the reading from a different

223
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,439
perspective and share out with their

224
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
with their group members

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
it was really it was it was very

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
empowering and wonderful to see them

227
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,319
actually reading the content for the

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
first time

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
crystal's referencing some of the

230
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
literacy strategies we've used in her

231
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,039
high school classes that could be

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,639
adaptable to a college course one of the

233
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,360
strategies is this thing called a

234
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,240
concept of definition map it's just

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,240
simply a graphic

236
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,640
organization in your teaching i'd

237
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,199
encourage you to think about that in our

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,199
publications we use models those are

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
graphic organizers this is a different

240
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,959
one a frayer model

241
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
what we know today as a teacher you know

242
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,799
a lot of ways can be found

243
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,399
on these kind of contraptions how we

244
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,399
learn is by manipulating that

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,519
information and so i took the concept of

246
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,360
powdery mildew and thought about uh what

247
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,639
it might be confused with some symptoms

248
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,278
some cures some prevention another kind

249
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,799
of a graphic organizer is a venn diagram

250
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,799
i tried something

251
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,359
i just remember the hops presentations i

252
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,958
went with what i knew ales and lagers

253
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
and you know just comparing and

254
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,078
contrasting

255
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,919
most of our literacy strategies or

256
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
there's a growing body of researchers

257
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,078
who say of the thousands of literacy

258
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,000
strategies you can use it might not be

259
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,278
such a big deal which strategy used as

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
long as you use something where students

261
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,600
are manipulating transforming the

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,159
information here's another kind of a

263
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,278
graphic organizer comparison contrast

264
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,039
map

265
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,200
down the middle we have our criteria

266
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,439
that we want to assess two different

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,278
kinds of ideas where should i focus my

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
teaching attention content or process

269
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,200
and we compare the two one of my

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
favorites that i've used

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,278
anytime i have a struggling student in

272
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,359
class is cornell notes you probably i'm

273
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,159
gonna use cornell notes

274
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
shame on you we teach here um so we have

275
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,679
a section for the notes that the

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
students would write in class

277
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,159
at home tonight they'll write a keyword

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,078
index and then tomorrow before class

279
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,559
they come in and write a two or three

280
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,078
sentence summary of that information so

281
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,439
they touch the information at least

282
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,319
three and probably four times because

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,079
they've listened to you once another

284
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
strategy our teachers have used like

285
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,199
crystal are things called admit or exit

286
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,039
passes might tie into marsha's

287
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
reflective writing

288
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,199
it's anonymous use index card to the

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
beginning or the end of class

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
those are the admit or exit passes

291
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
so if they're usually beginning in class

292
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,159
it's an admissions ticket into the class

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
the end of class it's an exit pass you

294
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,278
might ask questions like what did you

295
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
learn today

296
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,439
what are the confusing points about

297
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,119
today's lecture or yesterdays then what

298
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
questions still remain after we've

299
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,480
discussed this so it gives you immediate

300
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
feedback on your teaching episodes

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
changing teaching practices is not easy

302
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,399
as we found working with high school

303
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
teachers i guess it's fairly similar

304
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
here one of the criteria is fostering a

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
sustaining community of practice

306
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
not every day are things going to go

307
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,600
exactly as planned we master face

308
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,320
reality that we're not we're plant

309
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
scientists not rocket scientists

310
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,800
and we approach literacy the writing the

311
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,199
reading not as it is good teaching but

312
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,039
it's essential to what we do

313
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
we're experts in horticultural fields we

314
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,399
read and write we use information

315
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,399
it helps students

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
maybe a mistake to go totally wireless

317
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,399
you may have to use some of writing

318
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,838
which is an old-fashioned i carried a

319
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,679
pencil to a meeting a minute ago and the

320
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
lady said what is that i guess it's a

321
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,120
pencil

322
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,039
seriously um it began with authentic

323
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,078
horticulture learning not with the

324
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,360
literacy

325
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,399
because those common core state

326
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
standards when we're working with high

327
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
school teachers they want to force

328
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,799
reading and writing into everything it's

329
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,959
just not natural it needs to be

330
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,439
authentic read and write where it makes

331
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,319
sense in your classroom but do so in a

332
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
way that you can maximize the academics

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,720
the reading writing the reflection that

334
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,240
is actually embedded in learning good

335
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,240
horticultural science and practice

336
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
takes time and effort and so if marvin

337
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,838
wants you to teach a new class that

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
takes time if you want to adapt your

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,279
practice of teaching that takes time as

340
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,198
well because it's uncomfortable the

341
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,879
first couple times you try reflection or

342
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,120
try a graphic organizer out with your

343
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:49,320
students they feel the awkwardness and

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,320
tension you feel but after a while

345
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,799
teachers that we are i think literacy

346
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,240
has a role to play

347
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,240
in our teaching practice

348
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
thank

349
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:16,838
you for making me get outside of my

350
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,839
comfort zone

351
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,719
and five

352
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,599
four three two

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
one

354
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
start

355
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,360
okay thank you neil

356
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
so we're going to be talking about

357
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,278
extension today and about the regional

358
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
teams which

359
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,198
have really been growing

360
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,198
uh even though we've had these for a

361
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,120
number of years i think we're really

362
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,639
seeing a growth today i think it's

363
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,919
really good news in fact i think there's

364
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
some

365
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,679
better news about extension and what's

366
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,360
happening in extension than we've seen

367
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,638
in many years

368
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
there's a lot of people here in this

369
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
audience that probably don't realize

370
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,759
what it means to be in a land-grant

371
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,959
institution we have a lot of students

372
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,958
here and i just want to make sure we're

373
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,439
all on the same page

374
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,198
really focusing on the smith weber act

375
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
which established extension throughout

376
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,759
the united states even though a lot of

377
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,600
states were doing that previous to 1914

378
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,639
and new york was starting to celebrated

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,720
our 100th anniversary this year 1912.

380
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
the difference between a regional and

381
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,800
county-based

382
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,959
is that again county-based tended to be

383
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,799
a generalist they might do everything

384
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,359
from working with animals to working in

385
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,639
4-h to working in crops as compared to a

386
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,240
person over here in most counties i

387
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,759
threw a picture of bob becker up there

388
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,799
for those of you that remember him bob

389
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
was my

390
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,278
predecessor in the job and worked a lot

391
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,278
with setting up regional teams you can

392
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,838
see that we've got right now in new york

393
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,838
10 regional teams 34 specialists that

394
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,920
number is going to be going up

395
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
but what's missing ornamental

396
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,198
horticulture we do not have an

397
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,879
ornamental horticulture team and that's

398
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,639
something i think we really need to

399
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,799
change in the future i'm not sure what

400
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,079
the history of that is that's caused

401
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,479
that you can see here just some on the

402
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,319
upper left-hand side we see where the

403
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
cornell vegetable program the counties

404
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,519
that they're working in over in eastern

405
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,278
new york we've got

406
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
counties that the vegetable team is

407
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,720
working in

408
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,399
the big news is that as of january 1st

409
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,040
we're starting a new horticulture team

410
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,039
that's going to go from very northern

411
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,679
counties in clinton all the way down to

412
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,360
putnam in ulster county

413
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,879
and that's going to cover not only a lot

414
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,600
of counties but include a lot of

415
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,078
specialists as well

416
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
how are they funded ideally in a perfect

417
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,479
world 72 percent of the funding was

418
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,120
supposed to come from counties 20 from

419
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,560
cornell and 8 had to be generated by the

420
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,560
team members

421
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,078
reality is that the county money has

422
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,359
been going down

423
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,758
significantly

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,278
and that the program generated income or

425
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
the amount of money that's being raised

426
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,838
through grants primarily through grants

427
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
has skyrocketed and the teams are being

428
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
very very successful in getting it

429
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
outside monday

430
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,958
in terms of how we set these teams up

431
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
the

432
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,240
vegetable team which is the one i'm most

433
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,480
familiar with that most have similar

434
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
setups is a leadership team with mark

435
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
giles who should get a lot of credit for

436
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,880
the growth of the regional teams

437
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
answering to us answering to

438
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,240
like a game show here

439
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,918
advantage is a regional program there

440
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
certainly are advantages to that people

441
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
get to specialize salaries are hired we

442
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,119
retain their people for a longer period

443
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,038
of time

444
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,199
the technology we have allows for better

445
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,519
connectivity between the people out of

446
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,080
the campus and campuses

447
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,839
why now recession has made the counties

448
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,319
really rethink how they're funding their

449
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,399
programs and that's probably been the

450
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,240
most important thing that's happened the

451
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,160
success of existing teams the teams that

452
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,079
are out there are doing very well the

453
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,640
stakeholders want to see those teams

454
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,359
expanding

455
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
certainly the faculty losses since 1994

456
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,240
which was the year i was hired so

457
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,000
there's nothing magical about that

458
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,319
because these are the people that were

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,720
lost just in vegetable crops in the

460
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,240
horticulture ithaca and geneva

461
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,519
we'd have a similar thing if we looked

462
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,519
at ornamental port or fruit

463
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,599
this is what we've gained

464
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,720
two good people in anu and phil

465
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,480
griffiths but again we've lost 10.

466
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,240
um we've gained two

467
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,038
so where is that expertise going to come

468
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,038
from

469
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,640
we've heard from young nairo we're not

470
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:23,679
going to be hiring additional people

471
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
here

472
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,798
on a campus level in fact we're going to

473
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,519
be going down

474
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,119
so

475
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,558
we've got to be looking outside the box

476
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,359
who's going to be doing a lot of the

477
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,639
applied field work that was being done

478
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,399
in 1994 on the left side are names of

479
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,600
people that working in extension at that

480
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,200
time

481
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,798
over here on the right side you see the

482
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,160
people that are working here now quite a

483
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,119
difference between what we lost in

484
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,279
faculty

485
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
and what has been an extension

486
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,960
and what remains an extension that is

487
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
growing so

488
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,240
again the extension folks are the ones

489
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
that are really stepping up to do a lot

490
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,640
of the applied research

491
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,079
research component is expected

492
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
developing a regional national

493
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,119
reputation is expected grant writing and

494
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,879
success in garnering those grants and

495
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,719
publishing all those things are going to

496
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
be expected from these people and they

497
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,600
are doing that okay so for example we've

498
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,000
got judd who's really taking a statewide

499
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,918
leap and working in high tunnels christy

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
hopking with the retirements of faculty

501
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
has taken over a lot of the onion work

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,359
that was being done in the field chuck

503
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
bourne again doing a lot of the

504
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,119
equipment work over the capital district

505
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,200
and crystal stewart

506
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,199
has been the one that stepped forward to

507
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
lead the working garlic okay so these

508
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
are all regional extension specialists

509
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
that are doing work that a lot of the

510
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,880
faculty was doing before invasive

511
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,640
species becoming more and more important

512
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
these folks are there on the front line

513
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
and working with the faculty putting

514
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,038
together those programs to try to be

515
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,720
able to be proactive when it comes to

516
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,440
sweet midge or drosophila or a stink bug

517
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,720
all those things there are challenges

518
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
the counties want to know what are you

519
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,839
doing for me in my county i'm so funding

520
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,840
this

521
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,000
what am i getting

522
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,959
outside funding will it be enough has

523
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,038
been the vegetable team last year at 32

524
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,200
different grants five member team that

525
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,839
brought it over 500 thousand dollars

526
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,919
total of grants for these so again the

527
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,839
money does seem to be there they are

528
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,000
doing very successful

529
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,759
will they have the expertise the

530
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
training the background

531
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,519
and the facilities to go beyond just the

532
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,919
old research that's going to be a

533
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,400
problem

534
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,200
we'll be able to keep up with the

535
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,640
technological innovations again

536
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,558
not sure

537
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,640
i have to add ornamental horticulture to

538
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,639
these teams either create a ornamental

539
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,640
horticulture team or add these people to

540
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
the existing teams which is a i think a

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
good way to go as well

542
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
and finding qualified people has been

543
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,158
one of the hardest things that we've had

544
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,960
we've just gone through two searches to

545
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,360
try to find a person to join our

546
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,960
vegetable team in western new york and

547
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,000
we still have not found the right person

548
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,798
for that

549
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
so again the jobs are going to be out

550
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,558
there we need qualified people with at

551
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,558
least a master's degree

552
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,879
that have some training in horticulture

553
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,399
and i think i'm really excited about the

554
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
people that we've got out there right

555
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,759
now

556
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
and hopefully some of you in this

557
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,640
audience here some of the students will

558
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
think about a career in extension

559
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,319
are we limited to just 20 second

560
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,319
questions

561
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,440
do you foresee that these regional teams

562
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,320
are going to cross state boundaries and

563
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,720
what are the barriers to that

564
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,279
i that's a good question i don't see

565
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,360
them crossing state barriers yet

566
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,038
we still have a problem and an issue

567
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
it's been hard enough to get over the

568
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,919
county boundaries

569
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,319
and

570
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,919
there have been some attempts to go over

571
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,839
state boundaries and we do have that on

572
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,559
one of the the great teams

573
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,558
with penn state but it is much harder

574
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,798
and i just don't see that happening in

575
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,038
the foreseeable future

576
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,158
maybe if we get into one more really bad

577
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,839
recession

578
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
maybe we'll start to see some of that

579
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,599
but i don't see that soon

580
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,119
i'm curious about you know the approach

581
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,639
that travis and marcia presented in

582
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,798
terms of

583
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
reflection and writing law and then

584
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,158
steve's approach here we talk about

585
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,079
these regional teams i'm wondering

586
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,559
whether you're familiar with steve with

587
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,599
any attempts to sort of use these higher

588
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,599
level

589
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,279
thinking skills and learning skills and

590
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,079
extension it seems to me most of the

591
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,079
time

592
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,279
we get to give presentations or we talk

593
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,599
and we sit down

594
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,519
but the evidence shows that these other

595
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,839
types of learning actually are more

596
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,158
meaningful and more in-depth but i'm not

597
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,240
aware of anyone's been great enough to

598
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,240
go beyond just the superficial

599
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
presentation of information extension i

600
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
wonder if the regional teams think about

601
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,120
pedagogy and alternate ways presenting

602
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
that might move in a direction it's a

603
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,319
little bit more reliable we can try in

604
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,798
the classroom

605
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,720
the short answer would be no really you

606
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,558
know it's more of the sort of getting up

607
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,519
there being a book and just imparting

608
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,200
the information and then sitting down um

609
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,879
it certainly is going to be the next

610
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,480
step but i don't think i've really seen

611
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
any extension presentations that have

612
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
been like that

613
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,119
do you mind if i respond to that really

614
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
quickly too

615
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,639
you know it's also unfortunate that

616
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,319
those of us you know i feel like i

617
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,520
noticed it with both the teaching and

618
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,000
extension

619
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,319
component to my work i have incredible

620
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,400
resources on campus in the center for

621
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,639
teaching excellence to guide me in

622
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
preparing my courses but you know it's

623
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,880
interesting that we kind of don't have

624
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,278
that equivalent and extension

625
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,360
and you know maybe maybe someday that

626
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,278
will change that they'll have

627
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,240
because that really does help to get us

628
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,240
outside the box and help us

629
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,159
it would be nice to have a similar sort

630
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
of community of learners on campus

631
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
marcia

632
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,278
i think sometimes

633
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,439
reflection has been considered sort of

634
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,599
touchy feely or something and that's why

635
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,640
i was very pleased to see you make

636
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,719
explicit characteristics of you know

637
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,960
but do you think a reflection can be

638
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,440
applied to of course more technical

639
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,759
course like say plant physiology or in

640
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
chemistry absolutely that's a that's a

641
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,200
great question and i have like three

642
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,679
things that are popping into my head at

643
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,558
once um and i'll try to sort them in

644
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,880
order

645
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,879
uh you know what what that brings to my

646
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
you know chems for those if everybody

647
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,440
heard him what about the touchy feely

648
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,960
thing

649
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
i've heard people say things like i'm

650
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,038
not really a therapist so i shouldn't

651
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,600
have to act like one kind of thing but

652
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,879
you know 50 years of brain research has

653
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,639
showed us

654
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,039
a lot has been revealed in brain

655
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,038
research and it showed that you know we

656
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,759
don't think in our brains we think in

657
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,558
our minds and our minds are that's a

658
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,400
then the mind involves processes

659
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,440
throughout all of us including our

660
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,038
feelings including the affective and our

661
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,798
students bring all of that to the

662
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,278
classroom they bring all of their

663
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,278
attendant human massive feelings anytime

664
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,038
we have more than two people in a room

665
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,839
we have that and in fact our learning

666
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,158
outcomes talk about what we should say

667
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,399
do think and feel so it is a part of the

668
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
class so the question is if we want to

669
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
guide that effectively

670
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,639
um and i think we do

671
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
so yeah i think it and it can also

672
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,759
reveal when we ask those kinds of

673
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,080
questions you know sometimes i think

674
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,240
people have a personal discomfort with

675
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,480
emotions and that's a whole other that's

676
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,359
a whole other quality so what how i

677
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,278
think we can structure reflection is is

678
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,959
by being being aware of our own

679
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,558
limitations i don't want to go over

680
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
there i mean i don't want to talk about

681
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,639
all that stuff and you can pose

682
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,798
questions think about anything in a

683
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,759
course that people struggle with any

684
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,480
concept principles practices and pose

685
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,158
reflective questions around that so you

686
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,480
know how they're processing what they're

687
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
learning so in plant physiology it might

688
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,079
be a certain

689
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
approach that you know students struggle

690
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,839
with so you can pose reflective

691
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,759
questions they get at that and then you

692
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,519
also know how they're learning what

693
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,640
they're learning but we can't we can't

694
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,319
avoid

695
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,919
a human being that comes into our

696
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,079
classroom so it makes sense that we

697
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
would organize it in a way that that

698
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,158
they're getting the most out of it did

699
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,759
that answer the question

700
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
what's the last part of your scientific

701
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,960
papers manuscripts that you spent the

702
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,759
last section it's called inclusion

703
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,319
that's reflections

704
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,158
taken broad it's reflection about very

705
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,480
scientific you know what

706
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
what are the implications how do we make

707
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,000
sense of this what other questions does

708
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:44,158
this trigger that could be a reflection

709
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,038
and very much science working kind of

710
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
liz

711
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,119
did you have a question about your admit

712
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,240
one or your the little things you would

713
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,239
take from

714
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
students on their way in or their way

715
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,200
out of class do you then typically

716
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,439
just use those for your own help or do

717
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
you then address the specifically those

718
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,200
the next class or how do you sort of

719
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,839
work with those little e-value things

720
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,919
both of those

721
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,158
ways the majority of the students hate

722
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,240
similar things they'll hopefully they

723
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,320
get the key messages of

724
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,480
the learning for that day's class but

725
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,960
then if there are questions or someone

726
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,519
has a misconception in the writing we'll

727
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
use that as a

728
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,079
reflection uh recap

729
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,679
at the next lecture lecture on the

730
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:32,158
previous day's

731
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,278
talk to bridge those two content areas

732
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,799
sometimes if there are enough um

733
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,640
questions we'd you know take a long

734
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,158
discussion you can turn those some of

735
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
those into a quick

736
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,399
quiz if you wanted to the next day but

737
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,759
yeah use that some way to bridge that

738
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,678
if they got everything there weren't

739
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,038
many questions

740
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,640
then we wouldn't use them a lot but

741
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,079
usually you'll know where you're going

742
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
to see students have

743
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,960
additional questions or points of

744
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,519
confusion

745
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,519
good question

746
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,319
okay

747
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,720
have you thought about using class time

748
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,960
in a different way you guys just did

749
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,798
these six minute kinds of presentations

750
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,079
our typical class periods are 55 or 75

751
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:16,240
minutes long um would you

752
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,558
should we think in terms of

753
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,759
repartitioning that like here's my first

754
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,480
six minutes

755
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,158
now we're going to have a breakout group

756
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
thing and then we're going to do some

757
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,640
other kind of things so that each

758
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,520
lecture so to speak would be a

759
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
relatively small part of that class

760
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,679
meeting is that

761
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,158
something that that you typically do in

762
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,480
your classes or that you can see us

763
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,799
going forward

764
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,640
i'll be i'll answer real quickly from an

765
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,960
art of horticulture perspective in that

766
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,880
class we always begin with a reflection

767
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,278
they're writing as they begin

768
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
then we have about a 10 or 10 to 20

769
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:56,480
minute presentation but depending on

770
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,000
the topic with comments from the

771
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,839
students that get involved with that

772
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,798
then we have some kind of in class

773
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,199
experience and then a closing

774
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,839
um either their writing or reflecting or

775
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
a small group of discussion or so the

776
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,759
actual

777
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,918
lecture or presentation or whatever you

778
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,158
know that that's a it's a

779
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,000
you know we know that they can't really

780
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
and none of us really pay attention

781
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,278
after

782
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,278
50 minutes

783
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,480
so what you're asking about

784
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
in uh teaching terms would be a flipped

785
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,880
classroom where there's a little bit of

786
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,120
lecture perhaps but a large part of the

787
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
information gathering and transmission

788
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,639
happens outside the class so the

789
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,079
students are expected to actually read

790
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,640
their assignments before class and then

791
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,798
we come in and maybe you have this kind

792
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,038
of thing seven eight minutes of

793
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,960
lecture and then yeah it's some kind of

794
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,960
engaging activity that's the value of

795
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,880
all of us

796
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,519
you're a lot more than the red book

797
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
bible right

798
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,278
cue the head nod yeah i mean

799
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,879
but unfortunately when we lecture that's

800
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,440
a lot of what we are

801
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,799
i am anyway i am is information

802
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,960
transmission and they can get that a lot

803
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,278
more effectively in other advantages but

804
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,759
i can help students problem solve and

805
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,759
apply information and answer questions

806
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,599
doing an extension you're going into a

807
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,278
room where you might have people that

808
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,199
are 18 years old might have somebody

809
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,200
that's 75 and

810
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
a lot of times in order and vegetables

811
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
and fruit we've got people that are

812
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,119
close to 75 very different ways of how

813
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,440
they're processing what they're getting

814
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,599
the folks that are younger

815
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,519
want are going to probably respond a lot

816
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,158
more and i can see that they can respond

817
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,839
a lot more influence you know sort of

818
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
getting input from them and stopping and

819
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,119
letting them talk and building consensus

820
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,879
if i were to do that with a group of 65

821
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,158
year old cabbage farmers if i stop

822
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
talking and watch

823
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,880
information from them they're in silence

824
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,879
and

825
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,918
it goes on for a long time

826
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,599
because they're not used to that so it's

827
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,880
it's a little bit harder i think an

828
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,439
extension because you're dealing with

829
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,440
such different requirements

830
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,519
yeah just uh two comments here one for

831
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,959
travis uh my fifth grader brought home

832
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,640
one of those uh

833
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,240
concept mapping things i didn't know

834
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,038
what it was but when i saw yours i

835
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,880
thought

836
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,200
yeah that's what my daughter

837
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,159
got in fifth grade and then

838
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,600
uh for steve uh just another comment i

839
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,760
think i think that we do do that same

840
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,918
sort of reflection thing but it's it's

841
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,398
more like you know the talks the excuse

842
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,679
for getting them there and then

843
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,278
all the action happens outside the talks

844
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,399
you know when they come up to you

845
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,720
one-on-one

846
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,479
and ask questions and things so i talked

847
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,880
to you i think it'd be a hard tough

848
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,200
tough to get people to you know do

849
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,080
writing assignments during

850
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,519
meetings and things like that

851
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,038
well the dec i mean the other thing

852
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,558
you're looking at too is how many people

853
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,000
are there for dc credits and you're

854
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,839
gonna have to i can't go in there

855
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
they're expecting 45 minutes of talking

856
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,720
about a pesticide all of a sudden after

857
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,159
six minutes

858
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,798
you just break up into smaller groups

859
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,799
discuss the

860
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,639
pesticides uh this question is for steve

861
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,480
i'm

862
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,880
fairly new to extension i definitely

863
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,038
feel like i am one of the younger of the

864
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,640
generation of extension professionals

865
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,398
and you said that you guys are having

866
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,559
challenges recruiting for your regional

867
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,759
teams what do you think the catch is for

868
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,678
attracting

869
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,038
younger students

870
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,399
from your programs or anywhere

871
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,480
because i kind of stumbled upon

872
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,439
extension i don't really know that i

873
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,558
ever

874
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,399
knew extension existed until

875
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,720
right i think i think that's one of the

876
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,599
problems is that for for many students

877
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,038
they're not even aware of extension

878
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,558
if they have an advisor that has an

879
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,798
extension appointment then they're going

880
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,720
to be aware of it but otherwise they may

881
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,720
not they may not realize that there are

882
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,038
jobs available

883
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
and you can get out there and do the

884
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,240
things that you really like and work

885
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,239
with growers and do applied research

886
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,799
that's a good question but i mean we're

887
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,799
going into our third potential search

888
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,798
for this position the pay is

889
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,440
i think competitive with any other state

890
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,440
if not better

891
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,918
there's just um awful lot of technical

892
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,720
information from department students

893
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,000
and

894
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,558
if you're going to cut

895
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,558
20 minutes out of our

896
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,918
50-minute class

897
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,158
what are you going to cut out in terms

898
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
of content you can go forward i mean

899
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
maybe that content is essential to

900
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,599
understanding the field and this is a

901
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,119
conundrum

902
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,119
but i don't know how to get around it

903
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,639
out of a 50 minute

904
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,640
class period

905
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,000
what do students actually learn in that

906
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,159
50 minutes i mean they're going to take

907
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,398
away

908
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,559
not every you don't you don't have 100

909
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,959
retention of what they learn in that 50

910
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,639
minutes

911
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
and honestly it's

912
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,960
probably less than a dozen key points

913
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,240
that they're going to most of them have

914
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,398
remember

915
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,319
a week down the road or two days down

916
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,638
the road once a weekend happens a lot of

917
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320
brain cells get lost

918
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,320
so it yeah it's hard to give that up but

919
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
if you can transition and what aren't

920
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,919
these were high school teachers when

921
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
they were using some of these strategies

922
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
and they just stuck to their guns and

923
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,519
said okay you've got to

924
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,279
bring this graphic organizer in filled

925
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,079
out on this subject and we're going to

926
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,000
start there they really had to

927
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,879
enforce that with the students to make

928
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,559
them

929
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,118
do the work outside the class in the

930
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,039
reading but the students found it more

931
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,960
meaningful because then the lecture

932
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,039
wasn't just a repeat of what the book

933
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
said or something outside of class and

934
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,320
so if we stick to our guns and treat

935
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
class as a place we're going to do some

936
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,200
different kinds of learning and the

937
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,200
information download

938
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,480
how to rebuild it

939
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,400
right i mean i'm not an expert on

940
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,240
powdery mildew but i can get pretty

941
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,880
dangerous with the basics of powdery

942
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,039
mildew on my phone what you can teach me

943
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,720
about powdery mildew is

944
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,719
beyond has to be beyond looking

945
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,719
different

946
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,039
the retention is not understandable

947
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,680
so kind of going off at that point do

948
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,679
you think the whole structure of three

949
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,519
minute lectures or two 75-minute

950
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,279
lectures is really not an efficient way

951
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,280
of learning and should it be

952
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
more of a daily thing for smaller

953
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,839
classes to get students to actually

954
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,838
learn more information

955
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
well

956
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,399
it's a great question

957
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,879
some colleges are going with block

958
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,559
scheduling so that they have longer you

959
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,240
know you might take one course for three

960
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,838
and a half weeks so that you can really

961
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,118
sink into it

962
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,759
but i think that

963
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,838
we have a lot of creativity within the

964
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,320
short time frames that we have i will

965
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,960
say my classes i love are the ones that

966
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,960
are all after

967
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,680
i don't know that it's the length of

968
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,879
time it's what you do with the time that

969
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,118
you're given

970
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,680
and we learn things by

971
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,760
taking hold of it wrestling with it

972
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,159
manipulating i mean learning is is an

973
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,680
effortful process

974
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,960
one of the things we often hear people

975
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,960
say is one of the best ways to learn

976
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,720
something is to teach it right

977
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400
okay that's pretty good all right but i

978
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:49,279
can break that down how many times do

979
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,039
you touch the content in order to

980
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,119
effectively stand in front of a group

981
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,960
without passing out falling over so you

982
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,838
can teach it right

983
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,920
do a little reading online or in a book

984
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,078
you prepare you take your notes from

985
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,720
that reading you develop an outline you

986
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,640
put together a powerpoint

987
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,039
you might check a couple of facts you

988
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,559
might go find pictures and video then

989
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,358
you actually get in front of the

990
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,519
students and lecture let's say they ask

991
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,759
some questions so yeah

992
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,079
apparently you've touched that content

993
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
seven times in teaching

994
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,280
well that's how you learn it's not that

995
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,079
you're teaching events because you have

996
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
these

997
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,680
all these different kinds of

998
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,759
interactions and different ways of

999
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,358
as marcia said being

1000
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,119
cognitive with the thoughts being

1001
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,799
effective being physical with your

1002
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,640
content whatever i mean it's all of that

1003
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,039
but together is how we learn so within

1004
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,559
50 minutes or 75 minutes if you're just

1005
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,000
lecturing students are getting it one

1006
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,559
way

1007
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,480
and that's not effective if you can

1008
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,920
help them touch the content in multiple

1009
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,760
modalities

1010
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,280
with their physical and mental being but

1011
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
then also you know different ways of

1012
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,519
even cognitively touching content that's

1013
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,920
the security can we turn a question out

1014
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,559
to you here at the closing what did you

1015
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,880
think about this format i mean my sense

1016
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,239
is it's challenging for the presenter

1017
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,800
it's

1018
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,159
you know it forces us to do a more

1019
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,079
succinct

1020
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,000
job but it's

1021
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,680
i've witnessed one of these last summer

1022
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,199
at conference and i really liked it from

1023
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,960
the sitting out their perspective what

1024
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,399
do you guys think what did you think

1025
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,240
about this yeah i think uh

1026
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
it's such a concise

1027
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,919
delivery that i have to listen to the

1028
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,838
speaker very carefully i can't pay

1029
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,639
attention to the slides

1030
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,639
i can't read the slides

1031
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,440
there were times when i wished i could

1032
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,159
just like pause this line for like five

1033
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,159
extra seconds

1034
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,559
and so if it wasn't exactly

1035
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,480
20

1036
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,679
maybe the speaker could still control

1037
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,519
the

1038
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,440
the remote or something to advance the

1039
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,480
slides but have it be close to 20

1040
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,480
seconds per slot

1041
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,400
can we have a show at hand should we try

1042
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:12,000
it again next semester yeah

1043
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,000
yeah who wants to volunteer

1044
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,118
he'll ask this on monday i'm like yeah

1045
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,358
sure seven minutes no big deal

1046
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,680
um and i procrastinated uh and i

1047
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,119
had the ideas rumbling around my head

1048
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,118
for a couple of weeks and i had some of

1049
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,480
the slides already ready to go but not

1050
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
in a format that we could do the 20

1051
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,559
seconds i sat down at one o'clock

1052
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,039
yesterday afternoon and started working

1053
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,799
on this presentation but i walked away

1054
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,800
from the computer at like seven o'clock

1055
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,280
last night so the six minute seven

1056
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,920
minute presentation for me was probably

1057
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,839
four solid hours

1058
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,440
but i mean a lot of it was me going okay

1059
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,358
i gotta clip that video i don't have the

1060
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,679
software too i gotta find that online so

1061
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,920
