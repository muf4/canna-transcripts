1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:14,638
alright thanks Jeff I'm happy to be here

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:16,469
and kick off the seminar series this is

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,469
a little different from what i'm doing

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,969
now but it's something that I'm very

7
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:23,879
enthusiastic about so hopefully I can

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,469
convey some of the interesting things

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:31,140
that I learned over the course of an

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:33,600
eight-year stint and be so I'm going to

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,509
talk about ways that the atmosphere and

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,399
the landscape combine or interact to

13
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,718
produce flash floods in the Northeast us

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,120
so the structure of my talk will just be

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,320
some background on flash floods and then

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,448
describe my my study methods and then

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,619
talk about the variability in what's

18
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,408
happening in the atmosphere what's

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,678
happening in a landscape and then I

20
00:00:55,408 --> 00:01:02,488
define some runoff types that help us

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,129
sort of address how how flash floods

22
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,769
work here in the Northeast and then a

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,240
separate study that I'll talk about just

24
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:15,719
briefly is how people influence the the

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:22,019
prevalence of flash floods and then tell

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:24,810
you my conclusions so the definition of

27
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,780
a flood is fairly intuitive for most

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,609
people it's where water is and that it

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:36,269
usually isn't so we think of floods like

30
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,340
in the Midwest where acres and acres of

31
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,909
cropland are flooded and it lasts for

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:46,859
months and months and we we can talk

33
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,780
about floods river floods as water where

34
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,120
we don't want it to be it's it's

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,120
flooding our cities and our homes and

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:00,240
our our crops and hydrologists talk

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,100
about floods in different ways but but

38
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,269
the definition that I'm using is the

39
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,969
weather service definition which is a

40
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:11,000
flash flood which is a flood that occurs

41
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,669
within six hours of the onset of

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,019
whatever caused the flood so in my all

43
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,399
of the floods I'm talking about its

44
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,250
precipitation but it could also be

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,840
something like snow melt or

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,819
damn break so the flash floods are

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,789
different from river floods because

48
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,400
they're they're quick and like the name

49
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,949
sounds they happen quickly and the

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
inundation might not last very long and

51
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:42,179
it's difficult to pin down where and

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,490
when the flood happened and how long you

53
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,830
know how much area covers and things

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,830
like that these are things that are more

55
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,640
routinely characterized for river floods

56
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,719
it's harder to do for flash floods and

57
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,738
since flash floods are generally

58
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,770
reported by people not by gauges or

59
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,209
remote sensing then there's a bias and

60
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,400
where they're reported so they're only

61
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,989
reported if someone notices and calls

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,750
and says you know there was a flash

63
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:15,719
flood here so so so I'll get into a

64
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,959
little more in a bit about how I deal

65
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:22,680
with these challenges of detecting and

66
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,939
then delineating where flash floods

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,909
happen so the motivation for studying

68
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,340
flash floods is fairly simple flash

69
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,400
floods cost lives and money in the

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,310
Northeast we see damages in the millions

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,620
of dollars every year and unfortunately

72
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,799
people die almost every year in the

73
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,980
Northeast as a result of flash floods

74
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,360
despite the public awareness campaign of

75
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,768
the National Weather Service that you

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,489
may have seen the signs turn around

77
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:56,340
don't drown it's it's a significant

78
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,610
cause of death in terms of

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,799
weather-related deaths throughout the US

80
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:07,019
but as you know I'm focusing on the

81
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,700
Northeast so what causes flash floods

82
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,280
what we already know before I got

83
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,199
started on my work we know that in the

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,390
atmosphere we need sufficient water and

85
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,789
energy to produce heavy rainfall so

86
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:20,009
heavy rainfall could mean either intense

87
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,280
rainfall for a short period of time it

88
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,870
could mean a longer period of time with

89
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,449
less intense rainfall that still results

90
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,060
in a high volume of water in the

91
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,839
landscape we know that higher slopes

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,819
lead to more flash floods we know that

93
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,359
certain soil properties that I'll get

94
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:42,269
into more detail are make a landscape

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,500
more susceptible to flooding and when we

96
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:49,289
pave or in other ways make land area

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,839
impervious that it makes it so the water

98
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:57,210
has nowhere to go so if the if we don't

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:05:00,869
do a good job in in routing that water

100
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:05,609
away from homes and and and buildings

101
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,959
and crops and things then the impervious

102
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,180
areas can be a problem because they

103
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:14,759
generate more runoff and it has no place

104
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,620
to go and cause the flash flood so the

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,569
two run off mechanisms that I'm going to

106
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,970
talk about this is this is how

107
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,668
hydrologists understand the conversion

108
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,139
of rainfall to run off so we produce an

109
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,709
atmosphere or some amount of

110
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:37,350
precipitation and then what happens what

111
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:40,680
happens is one of two things either the

112
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,910
rate of rainfall exceeds the

113
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,889
infiltration capacity of the soil and

114
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:51,870
whatever that excess is runs off or if

115
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,788
we have saturated areas in the landscape

116
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,788
than any rain that falls on that

117
00:05:53,788 --> 00:06:01,469
saturated area has nowhere to go so it

118
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:03,719
can also produce runoff and in the

119
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,270
Northeast saturation excess has been

120
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,510
shown to be the most common runoff

121
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:12,269
mechanism because our soils have a high

122
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,300
enough infiltration capacity relative to

123
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:20,038
the rainfall intensity that generally

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,509
usually saturation excess is the the

125
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,870
mechanism that causes the runoff that

126
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:27,629
makes streams run a little higher than

127
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,889
they used to but we'll see flash floods

128
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:35,069
or a special case and generally we think

129
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,300
of them as extreme events but I'll also

130
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:44,728
talk a little bit about that that

131
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:49,650
concept of extreme to okay so

132
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:52,800
all of the the landscape variables that

133
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:54,899
contribute to those two types of runoff

134
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,460
are highly variable throughout the

135
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:01,799
Northeast so we can see a range of

136
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,109
saturated hydraulic conductivity which

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,728
I'm using as a proxy for infiltration

138
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:11,580
rate that ranges by an order of

139
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,620
magnitude the depth of the soil so the

140
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,008
depth either to bedrock or a restrictive

141
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,129
layer or a permanent water table ranges

142
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:23,639
quite a bit from almost nothing to a

143
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,930
meter and a half and then the slopes in

144
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,939
this area we have coastal plains and

145
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,218
that are basically zero slope and then

146
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,240
we have places in Pennsylvania and New

147
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:38,699
York that are basically cliffs and and

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,710
if you've ever driven in Pennsylvania

149
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,348
you know that the slopes in Pennsylvania

150
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:46,019
are quite significant and then you can

151
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:48,149
see a also a great deal of variation in

152
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,889
impervious areas and you can tell just

153
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,889
by looking at this where the people are

154
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:56,610
you can also see that that contrary to

155
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,399
what an Alaska girl thinks of the

156
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,919
Northeast is you know being all this all

157
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,379
super populated we actually have quite a

158
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,609
few areas in this region that don't have

159
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,810
people in them really very much at all

160
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,180
okay so that's variation in the

161
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,689
landscape some landscape variables also

162
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,180
a variant time as well as space and this

163
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:21,180
is a picture of the soil moisture

164
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,370
product that I used so you can see the

165
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,468
variability throughout the region but

166
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,838
then also the difference between what

167
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:29,848
may typically looks like in terms of so

168
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:32,458
moisture what oddest if eclipse like

169
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:34,379
little drier everywhere so we've got

170
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,318
time variance as well as phase variance

171
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,948
and then in the atmosphere we have both

172
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:43,019
space and time variable ability

173
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,909
everybody likes to look at at radar

174
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,100
loops so we're going to go through this

175
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:50,578
is one of the flash floods that was in

176
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,389
my study so you can see that over time

177
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:57,349
we have a different so the color ramp is

178
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,350
is

179
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,370
radar reflectivity which is related to

180
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,049
precipitation so you can think of more

181
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,610
red and purple colors as intense

182
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,129
precipitation and more blue and green

183
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,350
colors as less intense precipitation so

184
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,870
the white dot here is where the flash

185
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,800
flood happened so over the course of a

186
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,720
couple of hours that dot goes from

187
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,729
having basically no precipitation to

188
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,399
very intense precipitation to no

189
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,120
precipitation again and here's a

190
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,179
snapshot of what the the intensity

191
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,110
looked like at one particular time for

192
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:36,939
PM eastern this outline is the watershed

193
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,120
that contributed to the flash flood and

194
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,670
you can see that parts of the watershed

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,440
had no rainfall at that time and parts

196
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:47,409
had very intense 100 millimeters per

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,050
hour rainfall so lots of variability in

198
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:51,459
space and time multiple variables that

199
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,469
we're studying so it's a really

200
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,889
complicated system that I'm trying to

201
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,629
pin down here so my research questions

202
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,799
the ones that I'm going to discuss today

203
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:03,700
what is the dominant mechanism of runoff

204
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,439
contributing to flash floods in the

205
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,540
Northeast and then I'm also going to

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,560
address how human infrastructure affects

207
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:14,199
flash floods in this region so my data

208
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,599
set consisted of 180 flash flood events

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,050
around the Northeast us we chose them

210
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,909
from the NCDC storm events database like

211
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:25,569
I said we don't have a lot of remote

212
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:28,029
sense remotely sensed data or instrument

213
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,950
sensed data so we have to go with what

214
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,009
people reported and entered into this

215
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,230
database we looked at the years 2003

216
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,580
through 2007 we stuck with the warm

217
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,500
season so we don't have to deal with

218
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,810
snow melt which anyone who's ever done

219
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,720
any hydrology knows snow melt is very

220
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,309
difficult we also avoided tropical

221
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,370
storms because they behave differently

222
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,739
in the atmosphere and then once we

223
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,070
figured out where these flash floods

224
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,169
happen we defined a watershed for each

225
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,710
flood location so the contributing area

226
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:02,110
to that flood and then within that

227
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,940
watershed determined the storm and

228
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:08,230
watershed properties that I just talked

229
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,910
about so just a quick word this is

230
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,720
something that comes up a lot people say

231
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,850
why don't you just

232
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,170
look at where floods happened at USGS

233
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,209
gauges because then you have more

234
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:19,929
information you know the flow rate you

235
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:23,018
know the duration of the flood but flash

236
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:26,588
floods happen on not only faster but

237
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:29,470
also a smaller scale than USGS gauges so

238
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:31,750
this is an example again of a flood from

239
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,149
my data set where the flood happened in

240
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,129
this little watershed here so we know

241
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,720
that there was a street here that was

242
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,778
flooded and this is the contributing

243
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:48,069
area to that street flood the nearest

244
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:49,448
gauge is here so any any flooding that

245
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,909
might have happened may or may not

246
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:56,528
actually show up in the hydrograph here

247
00:11:51,909 --> 00:12:00,759
at the gauge so overall in our data set

248
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:03,549
the this histogram shows the the

249
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:06,250
watershed area for the dark bars or our

250
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:08,559
data set the light bars are the USGS

251
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,299
gauges around the active USGS gauges

252
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,578
around the Northeast so the average

253
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:15,068
watershed size for our data set is about

254
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:18,399
75 square kilometers and the average for

255
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,808
the USGS gauges is about a thousand so

256
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,679
we're talking about a very different

257
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:27,850
spatial scale here similarly with remote

258
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,500
sensing remote sensing have gotten very

259
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,808
good at helping us understand where

260
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,078
river floods are happening the degree of

261
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:38,708
inundation and the timeframe but again

262
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,989
the time and space resolution of these

263
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,419
products isn't it good enough really for

264
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,198
us to identify where flash floods happen

265
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:49,929
how long they last things like that so

266
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:54,338
here's a little tour the NCDC storm

267
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:58,120
events database that's a tiny bit blurry

268
00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:02,110
but so the database you can query it for

269
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,669
a location a date and then the kind of

270
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,769
events that you want to look for so I

271
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:10,568
filtered by flash floods and in this

272
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:16,269
example this is tompkins county and 2006

273
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:17,558
to 2014 and what you get is a list of

274
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,078
the flash floods that occurred during

275
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:21,938
that time period in that place and you

276
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,208
can see that on some days there were

277
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:29,198
more than one flood report

278
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:32,049
so in our data set we only count one we

279
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,698
only considered one flood per day so if

280
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,549
there was more than one flood we took

281
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:39,338
the worst flood the one with the highest

282
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:44,039
precipitation depth so when you get into

283
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:48,339
the results of this database you you see

284
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:50,498
time and place and sometimes you get in

285
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:52,509
there's a there's a narrative field

286
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:54,308
where the person taking the report can

287
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,068
give you more information and sometimes

288
00:13:54,308 --> 00:14:01,240
the information is not very descriptive

289
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:02,428
it just says ditches overflowed but

290
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,959
sometimes they give you an actual

291
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:06,789
pinpoint location and this is really

292
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,308
helpful for me as a hydrologist because

293
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:12,669
I know for sure what watershed or

294
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:15,519
contributing area was was responsible or

295
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:19,360
contributing to that flood so we like

296
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,028
those those are the best ones so here's

297
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,499
a map of our 180 events and you can see

298
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:28,688
some clustering of events in places like

299
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:32,170
western Pennsylvania down here in the

300
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:34,958
sort of very populated area around New

301
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:37,838
York City and some places where we don't

302
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:43,868
see flash floods like the Adirondacks

303
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:48,759
and north central Pennsylvania alright

304
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:53,730
so so once we establish where the flood

305
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:57,100
happened and like I said it if I can i

306
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,678
pick a location that's an intersection

307
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,829
or a stream crossing or something like

308
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:06,759
that as my outlet for my watershed if I

309
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:10,508
can't do that then I take previously

310
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,699
defined basins so they're they're

311
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,558
already delineated by the National

312
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:15,938
Weather Service and whichever Basin got

313
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,409
the most rain that's the one that I

314
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:22,048
consider is the contractor that

315
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:25,539
contributing watershed for the flood so

316
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:28,028
then I used ArcGIS hydrology tools and a

317
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:31,539
10 meter DM to delineate the watershed

318
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:36,178
that contributes to each blood and if

319
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:37,939
you're familiar with with flow

320
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:40,860
accumulation

321
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,140
algorithms then I just you be might be

322
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,289
interested to know that our GIS uses an

323
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,958
eight direction algorithm so it assumes

324
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:51,719
that waterfalls it can flow and one of

325
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:57,389
it can flow like in the basically the

326
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:02,850
compass directions ok so for soil

327
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:06,059
properties I used mostly the sir go soil

328
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,399
database so i got porosity calculated

329
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,219
based on both density the saturated

330
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,929
hydraulic conductivity and all of these

331
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,410
cell properties were averaged over the

332
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:20,159
watershed and then for soil moisture i

333
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:24,179
used a land surface model that accounts

334
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:27,120
for precipitation evaporation soil

335
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,458
properties transpiration and then

336
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,899
calculates what the model is what the

337
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,659
soil moisture would be on a given day

338
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,208
for a four kilometre grid and i use the

339
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,819
top ten centimeters and we consider that

340
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:45,059
sort of the most hydrologically active

341
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:50,270
area for the atmosphere the storm

342
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:55,799
properties we used a radar product that

343
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:58,110
aggregates rainfall in data into these

344
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,149
polygons that have that are their

345
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:07,110
hydrologic polygons so they're based on

346
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:10,709
on actual land surface elevation and we

347
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:14,928
were able to extract the intensity so

348
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:18,360
for for my purposes i counted the

349
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:22,309
maximum five minute rain rate anywhere

350
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,539
in the watershed so even if it rained

351
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,299
you know without looking over that

352
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,039
spatial and temporal variability

353
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:30,480
whatever the most intense rainfall was

354
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,849
that's the one that i considered and

355
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,000
then similarly wherever in the watershed

356
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:38,990
there was the most accumulation of

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,150
precipitation so a depth we talk about

358
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,349
precipitation and inches or millimeters

359
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,059
wherever that was the highest that was

360
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:49,759
what I considered the amount of

361
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,759
precipitation for that flood event and

362
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:58,630
it's sort of it's worth noting that as

363
00:17:53,599 --> 00:18:03,619
an exercise I did do a more detailed

364
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:06,950
temporal and spatial analysis or model

365
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:09,019
of the two different runoff types so for

366
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,019
infiltration excess I used to green in

367
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:15,889
amped equations and said for every 10

368
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:21,650
meter square every 10 meter grid cell in

369
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:25,240
a raster what was the sum of the excess

370
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:28,490
rainfall over the infiltration capacity

371
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,769
summed up over the whole storm and what

372
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,029
would be the the total infiltration

373
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:39,829
excess runoff from that that calculation

374
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:42,200
and for saturation I used a model based

375
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:44,509
on the curve number to say the same

376
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,420
thing for every 10 meter cell for the

377
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:54,200
whole watershed what was the sum of the

378
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:58,210
saturation excess runoff based on soil

379
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,549
moisture storage and the rainfall depth

380
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,590
this took me a couple of months to get

381
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,980
all of the products all of the inputs

382
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:09,230
together for this one watershed so I

383
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,630
needed a method that was less

384
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,680
computationally and and sort of my time

385
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,330
intensive to talk about the different

386
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,190
runoff mechanisms and the flash floods

387
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:24,639
and our hundred and eighty flood data

388
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:28,610
set so I came up with these indices

389
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,520
where basically for infiltration XS I

390
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:33,709
said if the maximum rainfall rate

391
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:37,039
anywhere in the watershed exceeds the

392
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,230
average case at then saturated hydraulic

393
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,869
conductivity then we're going to call

394
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,720
that the rate ratio so the excess of

395
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:47,389
rain rate over soil infiltration

396
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,130
capacity which I know saturated

397
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,140
hydraulic conductivity does not equal

398
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:55,520
soil infiltration capacity but I'm using

399
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,100
it as a proxy similarly if the rainfall

400
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,759
depth exceeds the soil moisture deficit

401
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:03,799
that's going to be our depth ratio so

402
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,220
the rain depth over the soil moisture

403
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,808
deficit

404
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,808
it and I calculated the soil moisture

405
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:12,109
deficit as the soil moisture the day

406
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:15,079
before the event subtracted from the

407
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:17,479
total soil porosity and then times the

408
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:24,678
depth of the soil to bedrock or

409
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:28,669
permanent water table so the results of

410
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,640
these analyses you can see the

411
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,919
variability in the landscape this is the

412
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,600
these histograms are my data set so

413
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,390
before I showed you a map of the whole

414
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,519
northeast this is what my dataset looks

415
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,460
like so the impervious area was

416
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,859
generally less than ten percent slope

417
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,048
was pretty variable but you know around

418
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:50,658
ten percent was the was the sort of

419
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:52,548
typical value saturated hydraulic

420
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,950
conductivity typically right around

421
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:57,349
between fifty and a hundred millimeters

422
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,798
per hour and soil depth right around a

423
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:03,980
meter typically but some variation in

424
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,200
those and then also quite a bit of

425
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,169
variation in the storm property so again

426
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:14,500
this is the maximum rate and the maximum

427
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:17,059
depth for the storm and you can see that

428
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,720
most of the storms were pretty intense

429
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:22,460
100 millimetres an hour but lots of them

430
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,750
were not very intense so that's

431
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,548
something to keep in mind as we talk

432
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,750
about what's causing flash floods in

433
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:33,609
this region and I wanted to sort of

434
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:36,798
point out for for you know reference the

435
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:39,678
storms in Ithaca so every year we would

436
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,750
expect to see a storm that's around 85

437
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:47,298
millimeters per hour at some point in

438
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:52,190
the storm and a total daily accumulation

439
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:54,288
of about 50 millimeters so that's normal

440
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,850
for a year so just to give you a

441
00:21:54,288 --> 00:22:01,429
reference of where these storms fall

442
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:05,000
with respect to a normal year so when I

443
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:08,298
looked at the rain ratio of the rate

444
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,409
ratio and the depth ratio I came up with

445
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:17,710
these quadrants so basically if the rate

446
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:19,929
ratio is greater than one I would

447
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,569
expect to see some infiltration excess

448
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:24,130
runoff and if the cetera if the depth

449
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:26,079
ratio was greater than one I would

450
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,640
expect to see some saturation excess run

451
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,398
off and then we have these other

452
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,620
quadrants where maybe both runoff

453
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:35,158
mechanisms are happening and then this

454
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:37,959
is a very interesting quadrant because

455
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,289
we can't identify either mechanism

456
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,390
happening by my methods but I have some

457
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:49,210
ideas about why things might be flooding

458
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:52,210
down in that quadrant so this is how it

459
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:55,558
breaks down about half of the events

460
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,620
were infiltration excess and

461
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,538
thirty-seven percent can't identify and

462
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:06,178
three percent saturation excess thirteen

463
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:09,490
percent both mechanisms are happening so

464
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:13,259
the spatial distribution of these

465
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:20,230
mechanisms or combinations of mechanism

466
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:22,480
the you can see sort of a spread of the

467
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,450
of the mechanisms throughout the region

468
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,339
but then we have these clusters and I

469
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,058
think these clusters are important and

470
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:34,028
I'll talk about that more in just in

471
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:37,629
terms of figuring out why flash floods

472
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:42,308
are happening if for example in this

473
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:44,559
area if we're seeing both infiltration

474
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:45,519
excess and saturation excess then we

475
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,210
know that this is an especially

476
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,829
vulnerable area and just the number of

477
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,019
events that are happening in western

478
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:55,028
Pennsylvania also suggests that it's

479
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,288
vulnerable but why that's the sort of

480
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:59,740
question that I'm trying to get at here

481
00:23:56,288 --> 00:24:04,089
so why are we having these events here

482
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,190
that have neither especially high rate

483
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:08,019
ratios or especially high depth ratios

484
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,788
what's going on why is it flooding here

485
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:16,750
and then in in eastern PA and New Jersey

486
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:19,690
we're seeing a cluster of events that

487
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:24,308
happen because of infiltration excess so

488
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,470
we can look at these variables again and

489
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:30,308
look at the clusters and sort of start

490
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,220
to to develop some hypotheses about why

491
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,490
we

492
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,009
seeing what we're seeing so for example

493
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,390
the sum of the shallow soils in the

494
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:42,408
Northeast are happening in this

495
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:45,710
northwestern Pennsylvania area so it

496
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,539
would make sense given my my assertions

497
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,220
here about mechanisms that that

498
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:52,788
saturation excess would be a likely

499
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:57,529
mechanism here they're not especially

500
00:24:52,788 --> 00:25:01,158
high hydraulic conductivity so seeing

501
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:03,740
intense rainfall and and infiltration

502
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:08,210
excess runoff is not may be too

503
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,940
surprising in the cluster here of

504
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:14,240
infiltration excess we have a lot of

505
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,890
people living here so you know maybe the

506
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,409
flash floods are happening largely

507
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:22,509
because of impervious area and

508
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,510
infrastructure but maybe it's because

509
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:28,210
maybe it's because the saturated

510
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:32,960
hydraulic conductivity is little a

511
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:36,500
little low I don't know the this one is

512
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,529
an area where I think there's still a

513
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,349
lot of room for more research just in

514
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:46,190
terms of like I said developing some

515
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:49,849
hypotheses based on this this structure

516
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,220
of runoff mechanisms and then testing

517
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:58,369
them with models or with spatial

518
00:25:52,220 --> 00:26:04,339
statistics okay so we looked at those

519
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:10,908
histograms of the rate and depth of the

520
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:13,970
storms in this data set and I was struck

521
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:16,039
by the fact that many of the events were

522
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,589
not especially intense and many of the

523
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,529
events were not especially high in in

524
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:24,379
total precipitation depth so i looked at

525
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:27,829
the return period or the recurrence

526
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:32,030
interval of the storms that caused these

527
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:34,908
floods and it turns out that that half

528
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:39,740
or more of the events are actually quite

529
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:43,159
common so for the accumulation or the

530
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,990
depth half of them are more at least as

531
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,190
frequent as the five year storm

532
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:51,589
and more than half in in in terms of

533
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,720
rate so the intensity of the storm more

534
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:55,639
than half of the storms we're at least

535
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,289
as frequent as the five-year storm so

536
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,990
we're seeing flash floods happening

537
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:02,779
because of events that are fairly common

538
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,210
so we think of flash floods as an

539
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:10,250
extreme event but they're actually not

540
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:11,929
that unusual in terms of the the

541
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,480
probability or the frequency of the

542
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,519
storm that's causing them so what's

543
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,558
going on why are we seeing so many flash

544
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:24,190
floods in places where where these

545
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:27,579
storms are not especially uncommon I

546
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,929
think a lot of it has to do with us I

547
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:39,019
think a lot of it has to do with the

548
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:42,290
infrastructure that we've built so my

549
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,759
little joke that I it's not even a very

550
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,950
good joke but if a flood happens when

551
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:51,650
there's no one around was it a flood so

552
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,240
we we really only care about flash

553
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,640
floods when they affect us when they

554
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,679
flood our property when they hurt people

555
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,000
and so there's this bias toward flash

556
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,130
floods that happen in places where

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,440
people live paces where people have

558
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,179
paved things and probably developed some

559
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,929
stormwater infrastructure of some kind

560
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:14,420
to deal with excess water if we

561
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:17,179
carefully design our stormwater systems

562
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,769
then this could help mitigate flash

563
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,720
floods that's what they're for is to get

564
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:23,058
the water off the road to get the water

565
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,610
off the parking lot or the places that

566
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:29,178
it's not supposed to be unfortunately

567
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:34,459
that doesn't that doesn't always work so

568
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:36,910
well so what do we do we pave things we

569
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,779
dig ditches we build culverts and

570
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:45,019
municipal storm water systems and one of

571
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:48,319
my research projects was looking deeper

572
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:55,210
into one aspect of this infrastructure

573
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:58,028
which is called Road culverts and I I

574
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,548
looked at a whole bunch of culverts

575
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:08,469
in several watersheds in the Hudson

576
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:11,048
River Valley and I said what's the

577
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:13,749
capacity of this culvert how much water

578
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:17,729
can this culvert handle it at its

579
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:21,538
maximum flow rate and then what storm

580
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:25,330
would produce that much rainfall too

581
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:31,690
meta to max out that culverts capacity

582
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:34,509
oh it's a barrel like metal or plastic

583
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,849
barrel that goes under the road so you

584
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,219
have a ditch an open ditch and then a

585
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:42,729
pipe and then an open ditch on the other

586
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:45,548
side so it's like so it serves to get

587
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:47,619
the water under the road and then it's

588
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:50,229
an open ditch on the other side so in a

589
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:52,058
city everything would be underground but

590
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:54,489
in more rural areas we just have these

591
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:58,749
open ditches and then the culvert gets

592
00:29:54,489 --> 00:30:00,429
the water under the road okay so we

593
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:02,649
looked at the capacity of these culverts

594
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:06,580
how much water can it convey at its

595
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:09,968
maximum and then which storm return

596
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:13,118
period would would exceed meet or exceed

597
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:17,619
that capacity and then i color-coded

598
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:22,658
them because people like to see simple

599
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:24,848
ways of visualizing the the results of

600
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:30,639
this so I actually gave these maps to

601
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:32,528
the cities or towns that that were in or

602
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:36,668
close to these watersheds and I said

603
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:37,929
these dark red culverts are your problem

604
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,788
areas these are the ones that are going

605
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:44,739
to flood the most frequently and you can

606
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:47,319
see from this map that quite a few of

607
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:50,819
them are in the orange and red range

608
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:54,759
which means that they're likely to be

609
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:58,148
inundated or exceeded every one or two

610
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:02,288
years so that sounds like a lot it seems

611
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:05,528
like a lot of failure and it turns out

612
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:07,269
that this is actually verified by the

613
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:09,669
people who live there they say yeah this

614
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:11,710
culvert backs up Bloods the road every

615
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:15,309
year or every other year

616
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:20,259
so it seems kind of extreme but it's

617
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:22,329
true in some places anyway that these

618
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:25,000
culverts aren't actually designed for

619
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:31,889
the amount of runoff that's reaching

620
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:35,259
them and we don't have good records of

621
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:38,710
every time this culvert floods because

622
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:41,648
people only report it if it's extreme or

623
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,960
if they notice or if they care so I know

624
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:46,418
here in the Ithaca area I talked to

625
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,659
people from Lansing who say their

626
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:52,990
driveway floods every year or two years

627
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,330
or the ditch fills up and almost hits

628
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:59,490
the road every year or two years so

629
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:59,490
we're kind of right on the cusp of

630
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:04,569
infrastructure failures really

631
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:09,418
frequently in in a lot of different

632
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:13,028
places so what can we do about it we can

633
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:17,980
first of all we can get people to report

634
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:22,630
these floods or culvert failures more

635
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:26,140
frequently and that would maybe look

636
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:27,899
like smartphone pictures uploaded and

637
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,520
sent to the National Weather Service

638
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:33,759
maybe geotagged so that we'd know

639
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,349
exactly where it was it could be more

640
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,720
like an app where people can you know

641
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:40,629
put in their intersection where they are

642
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,690
and say no there was a flood here on

643
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,429
this day at this time if we had more

644
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,909
detailed information about this this is

645
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:52,480
my this is my sort of engineering

646
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:54,250
remotely calculated way of saying which

647
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,110
culverts are vulnerable but if we could

648
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,079
have actual records of which culverts

649
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:00,038
are flooding that would be even better

650
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,720
and then we could give that information

651
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,640
to the city planners and they could

652
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,319
decide if they have a little money which

653
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,690
they usually don't but let's say they

654
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:15,119
get some they can prioritize which

655
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:19,028
culverts to repair or or upgrade so I

656
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:21,009
guess the bad news is that it's not

657
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:23,079
going to get any better so we're

658
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:24,788
expecting more intense rainfall in the

659
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,119
Northeast and a lot of places in the

660
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:29,950
world

661
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,449
and rare storms so I already said that

662
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,000
these flush floods are happening because

663
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,769
of not very rare storms but rare storms

664
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,599
are becoming less rare so we're going to

665
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:41,500
see even more flash floods if my

666
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:45,879
assessments of why these things are

667
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,440
happening are true and we're seeing that

668
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,570
in a lot of places our infrastructure is

669
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
not adequate and it's going to be even

670
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:54,939
worse as we get more and more rainfall

671
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,519
either more intense or more total

672
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:03,789
accumulation so maybe that leads to more

673
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:07,359
floods I yeah so what's all this wrap up

674
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:10,869
to mean basically I think that I found

675
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,819
evidence for both runoff mechanisms

676
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,980
infiltration excess and saturation

677
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,840
excess infiltration excess seems to

678
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:21,190
happen more often than in the Northeast

679
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,769
in for flash floods regular storms I

680
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,750
think we can still argue that saturation

681
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,668
act excesses the is the dominant

682
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,780
mechanism but these are special flash

683
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:34,480
floods are special and so high intensity

684
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,490
rainfall or high accumulation can cause

685
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,530
flash floods depending on the landscape

686
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:45,309
so it depends on the soil depends on the

687
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:48,310
the impervious areas and we can see that

688
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:52,889
not all flash floods require especially

689
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:52,889
intense or especially high accumulation

690
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,389
rainfall which is important because a

691
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:01,269
lot of research into flash floods is

692
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:03,099
looking at these intense storms and I'm

693
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:06,009
saying that we need to be looking at the

694
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:08,079
landscape too and look at places that

695
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:12,180
are vulnerable due to soil properties

696
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,980
due to slopes and impervious areas and

697
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,719
if we consider all of these landscape

698
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,460
properties while we're talking about

699
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:23,619
vulnerable areas then we and and also

700
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,440
find a way to talk about this time and

701
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,869
space variable soil moisture which is

702
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,690
difficult but find a way to incorporate

703
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,519
that into our assessments of the

704
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,980
susceptibility of any given watershed

705
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,170
then we're going to be better prepared

706
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,059
to

707
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:44,108
forecast when and where flash floods are

708
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:46,319
going to happen and then I found that

709
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:49,750
runoff types are spatially clustered and

710
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:52,719
of course where we build stormwater

711
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,298
infrastructure how well we design it

712
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:58,000
matters a lot it depends I mean it

713
00:35:55,298 --> 00:36:02,139
affects a lot how when and where flash

714
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,349
floods are going to happen so research

715
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:09,219
this still needs to happen I think like

716
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:13,240
I said the the clustering of these

717
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:14,949
runoff types is is provocative and I

718
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:17,919
think a lot of work could still be done

719
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:20,548
on figuring out what the causes are why

720
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,000
these runoff types are clustering in

721
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:26,980
geographic areas and then this can help

722
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,690
us get to is a particular area more

723
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,358
susceptible to high intensity rainfall

724
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,280
or high depth or maybe it's acceptable

725
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:37,029
to both or maybe we need to start

726
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,280
looking at reasons why small not very

727
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,548
rare storms are causing flash floods in

728
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,048
a given area and then I think it would

729
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:47,199
be interesting to do more in depth case

730
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:49,568
studies like the one that I did at the

731
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:53,739
10 meter resolution just to get an idea

732
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:56,230
of any given watershed you could say you

733
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:58,358
know this watershed is more likely to

734
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,659
have infiltration access or saturation

735
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:02,949
excess runoff and again the more we

736
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:05,348
understand what's going on in the

737
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:09,279
landscape the better we can prepare for

738
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:12,789
the witch storms are going to be likely

739
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,269
to cause flash floods in in that in that

740
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:18,969
area so thanks to my collaborators Todd

741
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:21,068
Walter Steve kluchi and Steve Jessup and

742
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:22,989
funding from the NSF and thank you for

743
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:25,048
listening to me and I have time for

744
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,048
questions
