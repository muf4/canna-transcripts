1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,380
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:12,058
University this is really a privilege to

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,870
be back at Cornell University in this

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,910
very same room to have memories of very

5
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,399
distinguished speakers and learning from

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,710
them so I'm I'm thrilled to be here is

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,250
this loud enough in my is an in a good

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,868
position okay so I'll just go ahead and

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,730
get started and try to attempt to leave

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:49,079
as much time as possible for discussion

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:53,670
so let's see okay we may have to stand

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,770
here okay it is working okay so first of

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,140
all I like to start with a list of all

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,910
the private sector funding I've received

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,409
to talk about genetic engineering and

16
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:09,149
and CRISPR and that is the list right

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,100
there so this is important because you

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,080
know in fact I've never done CRISPR so

19
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,149
never engineered a plant so I'm an

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,548
outsider to this field and I think that

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,640
gives me a certain degree of perspective

22
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,530
which might be helpful having received

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,379
funds to do genetic engineering it's not

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,320
a it's not a problem in fact that's how

25
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,298
you become experts but I can say

26
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,219
honestly that I don't have any conflicts

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,780
of interest in this area and I and it

28
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,719
because it's so controversial I think

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,109
it's important to make sure that's clear

30
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,420
so my motivations I've learned that it's

31
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,188
it's probably good to be explicit about

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,079
my vote of motivations and I believe

33
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,519
that the wise use of CRISPR new

34
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,508
technologies and genetic engineering

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,188
contributes to the comment or can

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,629
contribute to the common good through

37
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,519
increased food security and more

38
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,310
sustainable food systems that's my

39
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,859
motivation for coming to Cornell well

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,990
through the Alliance for science most of

41
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,560
all in this case but for this as well so

42
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,878
this is the outline I'm in it looks like

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,239
a lot but we'll get through it because

44
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,799
some of these topics or rather short

45
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,750
CRISPR genetic engineering and disease

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,800
distance and you can you can read it for

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,270
yourselves starting with crisper I want

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
to just say a few things about it first

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,939
of all plant transformation has been

50
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,099
accomplished largely by two technologies

51
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,139
that have been very useful one is to use

52
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,620
Agra bacteria in the natural genetic

53
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:37,559
engineer to to basically transform

54
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,539
plants and the second was to use the

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,580
gene gun particle bombardment a lot of

56
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,379
you were very familiar with these these

57
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,640
and am I still speaking loud enough if I

58
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:50,370
talk like this okay so so those have

59
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,609
been useful technologies in introducing

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,340
genetic constructs of interest in random

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,690
locations in the genome but nevertheless

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,250
useful CRISPR I think first of all let

63
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,949
me explain it briefly and then and then

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,139
distinguish it in from plant

65
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,449
transformation there are two elements to

66
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,949
the CRISPR nanomachine I guess we could

67
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:18,780
think of it as that I've already called

68
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:21,509
that the orange whoops okay all right so

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:27,870
the orange bubbly thing is the caz nine

70
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:30,269
site-specific nucleus and the the the

71
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,610
gray to green structure there is the

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,689
single guide RNA and working together

73
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,239
the RNA guide RNA leads the cast nine to

74
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,659
a particular site based on Watson based

75
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,020
Watson Crick base pairing and it Cleaves

76
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:48,539
at a particular location on that in that

77
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,820
double stranded DNA and so that's what

78
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,729
the that's what the Kurtz work as nine

79
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,280
single guide RNA does but it's what

80
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,189
happens after that results in gene

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,840
editing and and so now we've got a

82
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:06,150
double-stranded break and so the cell is

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,939
going to repair that you know as quickly

84
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,760
as possible sometimes often introducing

85
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:15,239
any an insertion or deletion of a small

86
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,529
number of nucleotides you know refer to

87
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,139
why that's important in just a few

88
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:26,339
minutes if you include into the same

89
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:27,769
cell a template that has homology to

90
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,159
both sides of this

91
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:33,589
cut but has this blue gene that's new

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,169
and you can introduce an additional

93
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:39,168
genetic construct into into the

94
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:41,029
breakpoint so if we were to imagine that

95
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:43,579
that blue gene that we've introduced has

96
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:47,029
some value in terms of conferring

97
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,500
disease resistance then and that would

98
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,769
be easy to imagine that that could

99
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,089
contribute to disease control this one

100
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,149
here though I want to comment on because

101
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:58,429
we're introducing in Dells into a gene

102
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:01,399
that you know and so we're causing

103
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,228
disruption to the the gene but why would

104
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,929
that be important because if you if you

105
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:08,478
target a susceptibility gene with a

106
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,810
within introduce an in Dell there then

107
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,758
if you've done that across all homeo

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,860
alleles for that plan this is weed in

109
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,030
this case which is a hexaploid then

110
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,840
you've created a resistant plant okay

111
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,668
and this is one of the ways that

112
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,799
actually this is being used so we've got

113
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:30,168
two ways general ways that could

114
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:34,038
introduce disease resistance there are

115
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:37,189
multiple ways that the the CRISPR the

116
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:39,560
the Cassadine single-eyed RNA can be

117
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,629
introduced into a eukaryotic cell but

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,459
the one that without going into those in

119
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,050
detail or we've leave more time for

120
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,848
discussion but the one that caught my

121
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,968
attention the most is represented here

122
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:52,158
and so this is actually where a there's

123
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:56,110
no introduction of DNA into the plant

124
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:58,579
it's just the combination of the Kaz 9

125
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,310
represented as purple the Kaz 9 enzyme

126
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:05,060
and the single guide RNA and those are

127
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:09,399
joined together in a ribonucleic alejo

128
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,839
protein which can be transfected into

129
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,149
protoplasts or introduced by the gene

130
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,519
gun and and again that's been described

131
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:20,870
as DNA free gene editing so I think it's

132
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:24,109
just an interesting concept but there

133
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,370
are other ways that the cast 9 and the

134
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,639
single guide are and it can be

135
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:32,259
introduced another thing I think is

136
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,788
notable about the CRISPR gene editing is

137
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,759
people have successfully multiplexed

138
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:40,579
with multiple single guide RNAs so we

139
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,490
can actually target several genes at one

140
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:47,069
time

141
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:48,900
in the same cell and so what are some of

142
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,800
the important features of Chris Burke as

143
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:51,810
nine gene-editing

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,810
first of all most important I think is

145
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,290
the precision this introduced introduces

146
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,759
very targeted and specific breaks that

147
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,290
occur at specific locations or

148
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,170
insertions that have occurred it's

149
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:08,490
defined locations and that distinguishes

150
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:11,970
it from the the previous forms of plant

151
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,470
genetic engineering it introduces

152
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,660
flexibility because not only are we

153
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,090
introducing a particular gene but we can

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,660
delete a gene we can delete a fragment

155
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:23,129
we can use targeted mutations or create

156
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,840
targeted mutations so there's there's

157
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:29,639
there's more that you can accomplish

158
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:31,589
then than previously generally reported

159
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,379
by researchers is a predictable type of

160
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,389
technology this is what I read and again

161
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,540
I see researchers were commonly referred

162
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,519
to it as democratizing genetic

163
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,180
engineering because it's rather simply

164
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,919
that it's rather simple to apply I that

165
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,530
has been subject to discussion I've

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,360
heard a researcher once say well once

167
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,489
they recently actually said well you

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,710
actually have to optimize CRISPR for

169
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,600
every given plant species so maybe maybe

170
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,779
it's really no different in this respect

171
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,460
then plant transformation but enough

172
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:06,469
people have said it that I I think it's

173
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,849
worth at least mentioning the one

174
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,800
wrinkle that I think is worth talking

175
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,950
about and hopefully we'll have time for

176
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,240
others as you wish but is this this

177
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,930
concept of off-target

178
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,569
mutations and so here we have the guide

179
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:26,579
RNA represented in DNA strand that is

180
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,860
that is the RNA that will guide the

181
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:30,689
CRISPR to a particular target ok so

182
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,720
there's it's going to it's going to

183
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,370
match this sequence completely but there

184
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,100
are other parts in this genome this is

185
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,720
rice right this is there are other other

186
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,450
locations in this genome where there's

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,240
not quite a perfect match but there is

188
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,820
the possibility of annealing of the

189
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,210
single guide RNA resulting in a you know

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,278
break a cut in a target that is not

191
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:59,450
actually the target for the for the RNA

192
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:03,120
and so these are called off-target

193
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,278
mutations okay and and you read at least

194
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,970
the popular literature there's they're

195
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,309
raised as concerns I don't think they

196
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,519
they are published this in a blog and

197
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:16,198
had a peer-reviewed but but these are

198
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,909
the reasons first of all implants what I

199
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:22,740
see in the literature is the reported

200
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:24,208
off-target rates are quite low and and

201
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,940
there's additional papers that I can

202
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:28,679
cite now and add to that a number of

203
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,199
thirteen citations so it seems pretty

204
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,838
uncommon implants there are strategies

205
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:35,309
for reducing off-target mutations and

206
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,829
these continue to be published

207
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,599
off target mutations number three can be

208
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,609
monitored you can find out if they're

209
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,430
there right through the whole genome

210
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,199
sequencing for in sexually reproducing

211
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:50,039
crops undesired mutations can be

212
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:52,559
segregated out and most of all it I

213
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,480
think it's it makes a lot of sense in a

214
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,278
clinical situation for human disease

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,980
control and therapeutics to to avoid off

216
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,769
target mutations if we possibly can but

217
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,579
with plants I I'm not sure I see the

218
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:10,860
risk because in breeding of all sorts

219
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:13,259
there is a lot of off target changes

220
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,570
beyond the particular genetic change

221
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,448
that we're interested in and that never

222
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,670
has raised a concern I think if there

223
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:22,169
are off target mutations infrequent

224
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,599
though they might be that are

225
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:29,909
detrimental to the plant we select those

226
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,709
out and that's and then that's it now I

227
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:33,269
do want to bring attention to this paper

228
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,088
here which has just published a few

229
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,698
weeks ago actually not published it's in

230
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,250
a preprint server so it's it's not been

231
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:46,049
published in a journal but but they

232
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:49,110
documented seemingly you know well done

233
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:51,359
way to my eye of translocation and and

234
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,159
chromosome duplication proportions of a

235
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,379
chromosome being duplicated they

236
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,059
documented both of those as a result of

237
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,929
CRISPR cast nine editing in a rabid

238
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:03,539
abscess so I still think the same

239
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:05,729
response applies it is that a problem to

240
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,639
implants particularly good since we can

241
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,070
we select and you test the progeny but I

242
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,960
think it's an area that's worth paying

243
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,690
attention to and certainly we're

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,750
searching so so we'll see where this

245
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,750
leads

246
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,590
okay genetic engineering and disease

247
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:27,149
resistance will flash through it just a

248
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:29,580
few slides first of all I wished a paper

249
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,289
in the journal sustainability on genetic

250
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,100
engineering from my perspective as a

251
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:36,299
plant pathologist and went through and

252
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,909
actually described the different

253
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,109
strategies maybe I'll show that this is

254
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:45,449
open access by the way if you're

255
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:48,600
interested okay so these top what I

256
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:52,410
think ten strategies were described in

257
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,980
the paper and cited for examples and

258
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,850
then promptly within a few months of

259
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,370
publication there were a couple more

260
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,129
strategies that were published the point

261
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,470
is that there are there is quite and

262
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,159
within each of these strategies you have

263
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,139
a pretty wide landscape of possibilities

264
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,329
for engineering disease resistance so

265
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,090
and and and so we've got we've got a

266
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,190
dozen at least right strategies for

267
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,129
engineering resistance and I want you to

268
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,560
be impressed by the possibilities that's

269
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:24,659
not to say there aren't concerns but but

270
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,269
there's a lot we can do we know we can

271
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,860
do already maybe not all of it would be

272
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,059
workable in the field but some of them

273
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,039
would so my conclusion from the

274
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,529
literature and talking to experts is

275
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,179
gene-editing it seems to be capable of

276
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,819
writing all the transgenic and all the

277
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:44,069
SIS genic types of resistance that have

278
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:49,080
been published as a result of genetic

279
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:51,300
engineering and it can also provide

280
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,389
targeting mutations large deletions and

281
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:59,609
allele substitutions which was not to my

282
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:01,529
knowledge possible before ok genetics

283
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,039
and crop pesticides so this goes this is

284
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:06,480
going to draw on my experiences as a

285
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,509
applied young plant a plant pathologist

286
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,539
and dr. Laura beers program first of all

287
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:14,750
I'll talk a maybe i should point out

288
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,049
that among the three categories of

289
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,750
pesticides

290
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:22,079
there's herbicides which is the largest

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,559
category of use of herbicides these are

292
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,710
all day

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,000
but still we're in the ballpark here

294
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,310
insecticides and my decides represent

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,909
the second category and fungicides and

296
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:34,829
other chemicals for Disease Control are

297
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:36,209
represented in the third category so

298
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:40,020
let's take the first one and that is

299
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,860
herbicide tolerant crops so or

300
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,289
herbicides

301
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,769
how could CRISPR play a role in reducing

302
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:50,759
herbicides is the question and one way

303
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,829
might be to engineer plants for

304
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,970
herbicide tolerance okay that's one

305
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,870
possibility

306
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,970
so if we look at a recent review paper

307
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,870
on the use of CRISPR research or

308
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,940
publication or Reserve results in in

309
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,789
using CRISPR yield was the principal

310
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,550
focus biofortification was was number

311
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:13,169
two and number three is herbicide

312
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,809
tolerance basically so pretty high on

313
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:17,849
the list and I know if the large-scale

314
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,739
manufacturers are using this in their

315
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,080
research programs to create plants that

316
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,830
are resistant to herbicides so let's

317
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,230
look at the experience with Roundup

318
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,420
Ready crops glyphosate tolerant crops

319
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,039
and that's that picture tells it all

320
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,349
these plants have been engineered to

321
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,250
resist an herbicide that would normally

322
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:41,100
kill all plants right it's been very

323
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,279
useful technology very useful to the

324
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,019
farmer you just have to ask a farmer is

325
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,730
is you know why do you use this

326
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,649
technology and you'll hear and you know

327
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,269
so that's that's the one side of the

328
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:56,879
equation the other side is this and so

329
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,860
here we have glyphosate resistant mares

330
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,409
tail it's one of the species that's

331
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,860
resistant to glyphosate in many parts of

332
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:06,779
the United States so that's I think that

333
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,639
I think it's fair even though the

334
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,409
technology's been useful to farmers it's

335
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,569
fair to refer to this kind of pesticide

336
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:19,199
treadmill where does it end right so so

337
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:21,740
we can talk more about glyphosate but my

338
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,830
point is that I don't think CRISPR

339
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,909
represents a near-term solution to the

340
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,910
challenge of reducing herbicide use

341
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,428
well actually let me let me add to that

342
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,509
because a couple of other possibilities

343
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:38,338
for the use of CRISPR to reduce

344
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,739
herbicide use is represented here and

345
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,689
that is one jeans jeans for allelopathy

346
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:47,069
can be introduced into another species

347
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:49,738
of a crop and so now the roots of the

348
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:52,858
plant become a source of the stalks into

349
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:56,249
two weeds that's being done with solutes

350
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:58,319
or goli own from from sorghum in a

351
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:00,989
research capacity it's not anything I

352
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:03,178
see as near-term commercial

353
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:07,829
what about Fitness suppressing gene

354
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:10,198
drives engineering the weed to to spread

355
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:12,719
a gene drive within its population that

356
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,578
is Fitness suppressive it's a great

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,189
concept it's being done in a research

358
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,378
capacity we're nowhere near commercial

359
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:21,778
use of that you know there's a lot of

360
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,808
issues to consider so bottom line is I

361
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:26,999
don't see CRISPR as providing a solution

362
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:31,828
to the review with respect to the

363
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:34,349
reduction of herbicide use in contrast

364
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:37,228
with respect to insecticides Maite size

365
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:39,149
and disease control chemicals my opinion

366
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,489
from where I stand is this is

367
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,470
low-hanging fruit

368
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:45,449
this is low-hanging fruit from again

369
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,329
think back to where - all the

370
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:49,678
possibilities that I described before

371
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:51,748
knowing that sure there'll be challenges

372
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:56,129
but this this is a very underutilized

373
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:58,019
technology in my mind alright so this is

374
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:59,819
a slide from Orange County New York I've

375
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,359
worked with Jim more beer for five years

376
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:08,658
on onions had a great experience and

377
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:12,389
this this a toasty crispy onion plot is

378
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:13,679
was is from natural inoculum all we ask

379
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:16,678
the grower to do was turn off the

380
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,419
sprayer and that's the kind of disease

381
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,579
pressure that was out there so clearly

382
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,459
they're gonna have a good reason to use

383
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:26,000
fungicides I we have that level of

384
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,169
susceptibility in the commercial ground

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,378
so I wanted to start with that sort of

386
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:32,909
fundamental notion that you know there

387
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:35,750
there there could be it - may a pretty

388
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:38,940
big demand for it that's hard to dispute

389
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,690
so the principle that this represents is

390
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,269
shown in the title slide and

391
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,519
complete resistance can displace the

392
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:48,769
need for pesticide no question about it

393
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,029
this is this is not genetically

394
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,039
engineered this is just these are

395
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,769
different turf grass varieties that's

396
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,349
got a very destructive root disease that

397
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,569
one has got the same soil so clearly

398
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:01,009
it's resistant and I'm telling you

399
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,720
against that disease if you want to

400
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:06,769
control with fungicide you're gonna be

401
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:12,019
spraying a lot so so you know obviously

402
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:14,480
this would be a much better choice this

403
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:17,059
this case does involve genetic

404
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,130
engineering it's a sis genic approach to

405
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,769
controlling late blight and all these

406
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,580
plants are engineered with that cysteine

407
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,710
and here is the plant that's not and so

408
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:29,689
again complete resistance can displace

409
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,170
the need for pesticides that's that is

410
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:35,000
something that is fundamentally really

411
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:38,210
well known among applied plant

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,400
pathologists there's another case from

413
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,039
genetic engineering this is insecticide

414
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,800
use in corn has gone down dramatically

415
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,859
since the introduction of BT traits for

416
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:53,349
insect control and it's that that is I

417
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:57,109
think entirely attributable to that and

418
00:18:53,349 --> 00:19:00,289
in other parts of the world we've seen

419
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:03,799
similar reductions in insecticide use

420
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:06,170
with BT crops BT brinjal or eggplant in

421
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,409
Bangladesh has been widely adopted by

422
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,930
farmers because they typically I've read

423
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,990
this in multiple places scholarly

424
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,990
sources typically they were would be

425
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,500
spraying seventy to eighty times a

426
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,620
growing season or more to control the

427
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,200
borer and now they're down to very low

428
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,799
numbers that's not to say there aren't

429
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,269
issues and concerns but but the the

430
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,139
point is that that there can be

431
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:37,849
reductions in pesticide use from genetic

432
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,759
engineering and we're not no-one

433
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:42,439
surprised by that it works in the field

434
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:46,150
another example I like this example from

435
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,549
Florida this is bacterial spot of tomato

436
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:53,900
here we have the same variety with a

437
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,609
single gene from for for pathogen

438
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,250
recognition a single receptor

439
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:03,169
that comes from front pepper right from

440
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,429
pepper and they as I understand it the

441
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,558
only reason this hasn't yet been

442
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,910
commercialized is because there they

443
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,149
don't know how to handle the public

444
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:14,660
relations challenge of a GMO but it but

445
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,700
it it's anyway it's published it it

446
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,980
looks good seems to work and this is

447
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,450
what they're doing presently and what

448
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,769
what our growers doing Kentucky I don't

449
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,590
know if you have much bacterial spot

450
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:27,349
here in this climate but and they're

451
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,579
spraying copper and copper is not good

452
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:32,480
for the environment it's not good for

453
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:38,449
the workers so I think my opinion this

454
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:43,279
is actually more sustainable so here's a

455
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,319
paper by go fry going back to 1975 but

456
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,599
still really kind of a classic paper

457
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:51,668
what he showed what he did was he he

458
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,230
plotted the apparent infection rates

459
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:57,830
against fungicide dose for two varieties

460
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:00,380
a more susceptible variety russet rural

461
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:05,529
I think was called in some Sebago here

462
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:08,059
and so this this differential there's a

463
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,859
slight interaction so the differentials

464
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:16,539
different along different parts but this

465
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:16,539
differential shows the the Aquila Chiva

466
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:23,418
Beluga side as a result of this partial

467
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:24,799
resistance so complete resistance is a

468
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,710
no-brainer when we have complete

469
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:31,429
resistance we we we can reduce

470
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,610
pesticides to zero maybe sometimes and

471
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:36,470
then on the circumstances here but even

472
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:39,289
partial resistance can reduce the need

473
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:44,929
for fungicide and that's what that paper

474
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:48,710
shows so it is it is well established

475
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:52,669
that genetic engineering can produce

476
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,740
disease resistant plants and genetic

477
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,020
solutions can displace pesticides for

478
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:03,109
control of diseases and insects these

479
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:07,009
these are I think well established so

480
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:13,579
if if genetics are underutilized then

481
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:18,278
how do we do it sustainably next and so

482
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:22,538
I think there are two fundamental ways

483
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:25,579
that we you can use genetics sustainably

484
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:28,460
and and when I say sustainable I mean

485
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,970
for the indefinite future how do we how

486
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,200
do we do it in for the indefinite future

487
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,940
not that I have all the answers but I'm

488
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,860
going to offer what I think about this

489
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,409
first of all and it all depends on

490
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:42,439
diversity it all depends on diversity so

491
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:45,980
one way to use genetic resources is to

492
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,620
not depend just on genetic resources so

493
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,079
make sure to deploy a diversity and

494
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:52,099
control tactics and we have a name for

495
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,798
that it's called integrated pest

496
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:58,219
management so crop rotation has a role

497
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:01,308
in the deployment of genetics

498
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,870
sustainably planting dates that might

499
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:07,599
influence disease pressure have a role

500
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:11,388
in deploying genetics is sustainable and

501
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:13,609
secondly diversity and gened appointment

502
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:15,229
okay diversity ingenuity gene deployment

503
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:17,658
so that by that I mean multiple things

504
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,269
first of all let's go back to this list

505
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:22,789
from my paper and sustainability two

506
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:25,399
years ago remember there are lots of

507
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:27,288
strategies that can lead to the

508
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:30,709
production of plants that are resistant

509
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:34,519
to disease and remember with each of

510
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,579
these strategies there I don't know what

511
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,490
the limit would be to the particular

512
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:43,788
applications that by that microbiologist

513
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,940
might conceive so I really see the

514
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:51,349
potential for a lot of diversity in in

515
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,690
the in the the genetic mechanisms that

516
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:57,859
we use so so what I mean by diversity

517
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:00,919
and gene deployment is is the list I'm

518
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:04,829
about to show first of all use diverse

519
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:08,420
mechanisms right use diverse mechanisms

520
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:10,289
the Beatty trait has been used heavily

521
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,539
for multiple reasons

522
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,460
in reality the best way to protect the

523
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,339
Beatty trade is to have another genetic

524
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:21,059
trait that is as a distinct mechanism

525
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:24,119
from the from Beatty and the targets the

526
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:28,429
same pest so diverse mechanisms you know

527
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,869
it's one way to slow pathogen adaptation

528
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,060
separate from that multiple why not

529
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,919
target multiple targets again this is

530
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:39,049
I'm assuming we're in a world where

531
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,940
genetic where GMOs are not considered

532
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:45,690
necessarily intrinsically harmful right

533
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,840
so a world where society is willing to

534
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,480
utilize technology systems and we're not

535
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,490
there but I'm going to talk about it

536
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,890
from the standpoint of biology and then

537
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,140
we'll we'll go forward as the public

538
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:02,310
wishes but multiple targets so I saw an

539
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:04,610
interesting paper on reductions of that

540
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,289
really actually pretty surprising

541
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:10,639
reductions in alpha toxin accumulation

542
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,930
and they targeted three points on the

543
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,360
particular gene of interest so why not

544
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:19,920
do that against other pests target

545
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:24,299
multiple sites make it basically harder

546
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,300
for the pathogen to adapt gene

547
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,680
pyramiding this is a concept that is not

548
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:32,279
certainly novel to genetic engineering

549
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:35,940
or CRISPR but but it certainly would be

550
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:45,359
easier to implement through the use of a

551
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:50,039
CRISPR engineered construct and at least

552
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:52,619
for for annuals and biennials why not

553
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:56,369
rotate again assuming that the public is

554
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:58,919
willing to have us use diverse genetic

555
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:01,589
techniques but you know like in corn for

556
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,779
example may this I don't know if this is

557
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:06,839
naive but it seems to me that you could

558
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,700
build in actually this goes back to the

559
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,929
multi lines work that I've read a bit

560
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,279
red belt when I was a graduate student

561
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:17,340
and thereafter if you why not you know

562
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,599
have every five years you rotate to a

563
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,119
different set of genes

564
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,829
resistance against X disease and you

565
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,829
just build that into your your program

566
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,509
and it's worth pointing out that high

567
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,798
throughput gene discovery and cloning

568
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:37,819
techniques just expand the pus about the

569
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,950
landscape even more allowing us to

570
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:44,159
implement this principle of diversity

571
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,980
and gene department so I think all of

572
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,200
these are possible through conventional

573
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,519
breeding but they're probably

574
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,679
facilitated through genetic engineering

575
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:58,319
including through and especially through

576
00:26:52,679 --> 00:27:01,919
CRISPR so I I do believe from my

577
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,079
perspective the gene editing is likely

578
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:13,140
to permit more rapid breeding responses

579
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:14,699
to evolving pathogen populations so yeah

580
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,788
but we've got a we've always got to

581
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,220
think not I am excited about the

582
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:22,919
potential for with the wise use of

583
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,950
CRISPR I'm you know I mean it's pretty

584
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,230
hard to hide that but our job is as

585
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,120
scientists is to be willing to look at

586
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,429
the full picture right and that's part

587
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:35,759
of what will happen in the discussion

588
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:38,820
but but he and so here's one example I

589
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,970
mean as a biologist this this one

590
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:43,769
certainly catches my attention so so for

591
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,150
at least for a period of time there was

592
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:50,940
only one Bt toxin event using cotton

593
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,769
worldwide so I mean it's again it's

594
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,390
pretty easy to imagine that that kind of

595
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:58,589
widespread use of a single gene

596
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:00,110
construct could represent a risk right

597
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:04,048
how do we know

598
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:06,538
well I credit Roy Moore for those who

599
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:08,369
you remember him he he taught a

600
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:13,558
wonderful fight I think was a 500 level

601
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:16,649
course that was grueling with the

602
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:19,558
laboratories but but boy did I learn a

603
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,200
lot and so southern corn the leaf blade

604
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:29,490
is a disease that still exists but but

605
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:31,230
in 1970 what happened was very severe

606
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,679
epidemic developed in the United States

607
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:37,429
due to the presence of so there's the

608
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,990
epidemic and you know in Kentucky and

609
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,000
that is not fall coloration because you

610
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,099
can see this trees are green that is an

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,369
epidemic that happened why throughout

612
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:49,678
the United much of the corn growing area

613
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:53,219
and where she had the infection

614
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,580
progressed into the grain itself which

615
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,519
was unusual and it turned out that the

616
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:02,819
that a mitochondrial gene there it is

617
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,798
identified by mitochondrial gene that

618
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:08,939
conferred cytoplasmic male sterility

619
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:13,470
actually also had a pleiotropic effect

620
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:16,380
in conferring hyper susceptibility to an

621
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,860
unknown strain of southern corn leaf

622
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,780
blight so this genetic and this is all

623
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,668
natural this is all the result of

624
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:25,558
conventional breeding so we're not

625
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:28,820
picking on genetic engineering or

626
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:33,289
conventional breeding so this this

627
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:36,599
natural genetic trait was what

628
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:39,058
predisposed unknown advanced was

629
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,308
predisposed to crop to this epidemic so

630
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,200
we know that the widespread use of a

631
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:46,379
particular genetic construct

632
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,899
could lead to an unexpected outcomes we

633
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:54,330
have to recognize that as biologists but

634
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:56,239
but overall my opinion is that the

635
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:59,449
sustainable use of genetic research

636
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,279
resources for disease control actually

637
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,690
puts more would would depend on greater

638
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,928
reliance on genetic knowledge and

639
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,759
innovation not what not less not less

640
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:13,909
knowledge and not less application but

641
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,908
greater reliance as you as you've seen

642
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:19,950
ok social considerations we're not going

643
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,609
to go into the deeply but I think it's

644
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:27,360
important to give voice to the social

645
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:30,240
dimension of these technologies and you

646
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,479
know everyone that social scientists ask

647
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,720
is who decides where to use the

648
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,339
technology in wet and I don't think

649
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,420
there is an easy answer to that but it's

650
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,269
a good thing to wonder as

651
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:49,090
who decides who benefits before we use

652
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:53,440
it who might be the beneficiary at what

653
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:55,990
rate is it used you know again I don't

654
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,440
think I know the answers who might be

655
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,569
disadvantaged and does genetic

656
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,640
engineering promote food access and

657
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,439
those are the things that interested me

658
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,810
most the things that can contribute to

659
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,420
sustainability in a social sense or an

660
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,339
environmental sense so that's that's why

661
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,470
I I think it's important to think beyond

662
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:16,839
and talk beyond just the glyphosate

663
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:23,019
roundup ready trait that's the most

664
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:27,069
common one of the other dimensions that

665
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:29,200
I think is important to recognize as as

666
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:32,169
biologists is the fact that trans gene

667
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,819
flow recognizing trans genes or genes

668
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,370
from outside the breeding pool and the

669
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:40,929
flow of trans genes could represent a

670
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:44,859
risk right to environments or the

671
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:46,810
environment or or cultural risks and so

672
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:50,369
I don't have the easy answer for this

673
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:55,179
one either so this is these are

674
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:56,979
campesino farmers in nicaragua and they

675
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,310
they produce their own ancient varieties

676
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,230
and so you know if we get trans gene

677
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,909
flow with Roundup Ready trade into their

678
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,150
variety even if it occurs at low

679
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:10,180
percentage and even if it has no

680
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:13,840
economic impact whatsoever they don't

681
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:16,779
want it in their corn so I think we've

682
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,129
got to recognize that as an issue that

683
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:22,329
applies to trans jeans

684
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,920
I don't think the same applies if we

685
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:25,899
engineered our corn with a cysteine

686
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,759
which is from the breeding pool of corn

687
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,450
I don't think the same applies if we

688
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:33,039
take create a deletion or an endo cause

689
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,140
in targeting mutations because all of

690
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,509
those things can happen naturally in the

691
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,490
Oh in the gene pool of the crop but

692
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:42,369
within in the case of trans jeans I

693
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,549
think this represents an issue social

694
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,549
risk

695
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:53,240
but not all applications of oh yeah

696
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:55,909
actually yeah there is another point and

697
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,950
so when some of my good friends are more

698
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,580
concerned about the impact of genetic

699
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:04,039
engineering on on small holders there he

700
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:06,109
is saving a seed could he save the seed

701
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,450
if it you know was a genetically

702
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:11,509
engineered crop and you know here in the

703
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,600
United States no at least not until you

704
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:18,619
know the label is off the product is off

705
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:20,539
patent so again it's that sort of a

706
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:23,509
social consideration not a biological

707
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:27,529
one but it's important nevertheless not

708
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:31,490
all applications of genetic engineering

709
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,930
are harmful to small holders some are

710
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,140
beneficial and here's just a few

711
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:39,259
examples done with small holders in mind

712
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,140
this work the furka project is is to

713
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:44,420
create disease resistance against

714
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,370
cassava diseases they I'm sure they do

715
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,050
others in this project but that was

716
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:50,479
that's the one that got my attention and

717
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:53,119
they are categorically they

718
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,579
categorically must distribute those

719
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,489
genetic traits once they're publicly

720
00:33:55,579 --> 00:34:05,259
released they must distribute those

721
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:05,259
freely and to allow them to be shared so

722
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:11,029
this is these are poisonings incidents

723
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:14,630
of acute poisonings in among cotton

724
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:17,750
growers in India and BT of course is the

725
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:21,320
engineered plant and non bt is non

726
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,349
engineered and the the the incidence of

727
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,080
no poisonings was high at much higher

728
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:28,789
for those who had he had BT crop they

729
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,849
weren't spraying as many insecticides

730
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:34,309
makes sense right and they you see that

731
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:36,549
all the way up through to all these

732
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:39,710
different categories the incidence of

733
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,659
multiple poisonings was lower where they

734
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,389
use BT because they weren't dependent on

735
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:49,070
insecticides I've seen the same kind of

736
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:50,809
data from China so again I it's an

737
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,289
example of how not all examples of

738
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:56,509
genetic engineering are harmful to small

739
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:59,869
holders they may be beneficial here

740
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,000
one that again caught my attention this

741
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:04,608
was work again with cotton by its are

742
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,969
cotton bt cotton in colombia and it

743
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:11,269
reports that the women farmers actually

744
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:13,399
preferred the bt cotton because it saved

745
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:16,219
them time and it allowed them to have

746
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,079
less cost and spread hiring somebody to

747
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:22,759
spray their cotton so some reflections

748
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,500
we're gonna end up with 20th time which

749
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,140
is good so um I took that picture I did

750
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,909
not get over sprayed so I had it all

751
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:37,719
planned out very well but that's from

752
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:40,670
Orange County New York and so if we want

753
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,709
to reduce pesticides against diseases in

754
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,680
insects we must give farmers

755
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:49,550
alternatives I don't know of any other

756
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:54,019
way as an applied plant pathologist here

757
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,970
is a producer smallholder producer in

758
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,009
nicaragua and he's spraying chemicals

759
00:35:55,969 --> 00:36:02,179
and he was actually spraying Cortile no

760
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:03,950
Jim no protection and you know I'd like

761
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:06,469
to see him to have an option here and

762
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:08,809
he's probably going to keep spraying

763
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:11,959
until he has an option and most of the

764
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:13,789
time options mean some sort of genetic

765
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,130
solution genetic engineering

766
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:20,869
conventional breeding something in this

767
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,490
I took all these pictures this was in

768
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:25,608
Nicaragua as well and that little girl

769
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:29,329
is about ten meters from that rice field

770
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:31,400
which gets treated by airplane that's

771
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:37,400
not good that is a bad situation

772
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:39,559
and so I I would like to see options if

773
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,930
we want this grower to stop using

774
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:47,329
pesticides from the air we have to give

775
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:51,909
him or her alternatives we know I've

776
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:54,199
spent still hard to believe 35 years

777
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:57,019
working with pesticides for Disease

778
00:36:54,199 --> 00:37:00,439
Control starting in 1983 with you Morgan

779
00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:01,929
when wonderful learning experience I've

780
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,970
been working that long with these and

781
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:09,649
I've you know i think i think most apply

782
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:11,088
plant pathologists would agree that

783
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,510
playing resistance is the principle

784
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:16,369
pathway to reducing pesticide use again

785
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm not saying it necessarily has to be

786
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:19,338
crisper

787
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,960
but we need genetic solutions and we're

788
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:25,578
not we're not getting enough of them at

789
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,798
this point my perception is that CRISPR

790
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,710
based gene editing is it opens doors to

791
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:31,849
engineering disease resistance and

792
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,949
sometimes with advantages compared to

793
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:39,470
transformation or conventional breeding

794
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:41,778
and maybe it gives us target crops that

795
00:37:39,469 --> 00:38:52,038
are heavily dependent on we saw some

796
00:37:41,778 --> 00:38:55,159
slides so yeah we've discussed so that's

797
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,770
great way yeah that's a really good

798
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:00,230
question I you know I I think that's one

799
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,730
of those things I'm probably as in tree

800
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,298
I am as interested in your what you

801
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:09,199
think about it is whatever I think how

802
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:10,670
do we describe these technologies I so I

803
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,449
may change my mind on the plane home

804
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:16,190
after the discussion but I tend to so I

805
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:18,798
do a lot of outreach on this topic with

806
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,420
the public and I usually ask for about

807
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:22,309
an hour and a half and in that period of

808
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,380
time I

809
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:27,349
I have the leisure to be able to talk

810
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,519
using some pretty useful graphics you

811
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,338
know what what is genetic engineering

812
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:32,688
what is crisper and how is it used and

813
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:35,688
and you know there can be some overlap

814
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:38,389
in the outcomes right you know but but

815
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:40,338
but they are distinct I I have tend to

816
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:42,108
describe it all as genetic engineering

817
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:44,778
to the public and as long as people

818
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:46,670
understand and get comfortable with what

819
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:48,978
you know how genetic engineering is like

820
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,048
copying and pasting sentences copied

821
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:53,509
from this file paste of that file right

822
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:55,159
the sentence is the gene and now we've

823
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:57,259
just placed it into another file and

824
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,998
everybody knows how to do that and

825
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:01,278
they're like oh okay it's not that

826
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:03,798
mysterious if they understand that it

827
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:05,239
almost it almost doesn't matter which

828
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:07,788
language whether I call it genetic

829
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:11,389
engineering or precision breeding or

830
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:13,939
something the problem is that I have an

831
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:17,900
hour and a half and with many times you

832
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:21,379
have ten seconds so I want to present it

833
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:24,650
transparently it seems as a scientist to

834
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,209
be under the large umbrella of genetic

835
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:30,229
engineering but that might scare people

836
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:32,208
and yeah it's it's a dilemma because I

837
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:46,298
want I want to convey is you know the

838
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:49,788
accuracy of the phrase yes perfect yes

839
00:40:46,298 --> 00:40:52,659
yes well stated yeah I think it does if

840
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:55,160
we're if we if we use words that avoid

841
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:57,259
you know what they what people might

842
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,298
think we're really talking about then we

843
00:40:57,259 --> 00:41:03,650
we do run the risk of losing trust and

844
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:07,159
and I will tell you trust is everything

845
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:09,019
in this work I can't tell you how

846
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:11,659
important is it there's a yeah I can

847
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:15,098
there's a way to do it this is a this is

848
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:20,478
a saying that I learned somewhere people

849
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:23,959
don't care how much you know until they

850
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:26,899
know how much you care so so yeah

851
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:28,998
putting it you raise a good point and

852
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,068
putting it in those terms I think

853
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:33,678
anything that diminishes the trust

854
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:35,568
people have in us as public servants

855
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,028
which we all are you know

856
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:39,889
all trying to get a job and you know be

857
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,588
happy in our lives but we are working in

858
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:46,129
a public institution and I think that

859
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:47,958
Trust is we've got to do everything we

860
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,459
can to protect it but these are great

861
00:41:47,958 --> 00:42:10,538
comments and be interesting hear from

862
00:41:49,458 --> 00:42:10,538
you yeah industry have so much of our

863
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,039
some of the issue is is this going to be

864
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:21,139
affordable to use for its purpose what

865
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:55,999
I've seen from the media is that there's

866
00:42:21,139 --> 00:43:00,469
additional yeah well I don't anticipate

867
00:42:55,998 --> 00:43:05,348
it being more expensive than current you

868
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:05,349
know practices of genetic engineering I

869
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,210
think we

870
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:14,950
have to wait and see I haven't seen you

871
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:17,710
know I'm seeing much that indicates you

872
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:20,409
know the long-term cost to farmers and

873
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,389
and so on one of the things though it

874
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:24,969
definitely represents an opportunity and

875
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:27,089
corporations can't price their products

876
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:30,549
out of the market you know obviously I

877
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,769
went to it's called CRISPR con the

878
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,500
CRISPR conference Berkeley I know maybe

879
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:38,110
you're familiar with it yeah it's it was

880
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:41,980
a great conference and because it had

881
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:45,250
people from all walks of life

882
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,570
you know attending and and they did

883
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,460
these little surveys that you could

884
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:53,170
respond to on your phone and and so what

885
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,720
you know I think people responded we had

886
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:58,960
a pretty good survey results and when

887
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,599
they asked the question what sector D

888
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:06,190
represent a what area she represented

889
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,319
half where agriculture what and and so

890
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,050
that means you know all the applications

891
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,570
in the therapeutic world and you know

892
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,310
and other applications were the other

893
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:20,110
half in other words the big one by far

894
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:23,559
was agricultural uses so it must have a

895
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:24,910
lot of potential to make money for so

896
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,739
many people to be there from the

897
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:28,480
agricultural world

898
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:29,799
you know these were company

899
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,170
representatives and sure maybe

900
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,600
large-scale farmers but not not small

901
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:39,460
farmers but um so I yeah there's I I

902
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,880
worry a little bit that it's going to be

903
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:47,440
used principally for herbicide tolerance

904
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,300
and again I I think that's I respect the

905
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,990
benefit is brought to the growers who

906
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:55,000
use it I totally do and it's not it's

907
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:57,879
not the kind of application that excites

908
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,010
me because of all the things that we

909
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,320
could be doing so maybe maybe the cost

910
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,960
issues we'll learn more as we go through

911
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:16,740
I don't know what there will be them

912
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:20,039
yeah plants with approaches to avoiding

913
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:21,729
such as like polar polyculture

914
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:25,358
you know

915
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:27,240
no systematic research in that area yeah

916
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,858
and so you know I made the point that

917
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:33,039
diversifying disease control tactics is

918
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,719
is going to be important to reducing the

919
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,179
pressure and the selection pressure on

920
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,409
the pests and and that's that's true

921
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:40,000
whether we're dealing with a genetic

922
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:41,799
trait or a fungicide that's why I'm

923
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,750
quite confident whether we know from

924
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,640
fronting we recommend with fungicides

925
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,519
don't rely on just on the fungicide use

926
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:52,960
other mechanisms for Disease Control or

927
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:57,550
the tactics you know so I'm saying that

928
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,829
as as an academician knowing that in

929
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,450
reality it's you know growers have a lot

930
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:04,029
of things to be concerned about they may

931
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:05,889
not always do what they should but our

932
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,450
you know our job first is to understand

933
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:11,009
the biology and I think the biology is

934
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:13,509
pretty sound that we you know we want to

935
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,760
we at least know that we should be

936
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:18,900
recommending alternatives and other

937
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:23,260
tactics for disease control and

938
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,608
implement it as best we can but nobody

939
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,770
back to your specific question I'm not

940
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:29,049
seeing studies that integrate the two I

941
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:32,909
think think we have a lot of experience

942
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:34,960
research-based experience with

943
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:36,069
everything else you know the host plant

944
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,070
resistance through conventional means

945
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:42,609
and all other cultural and chemical

946
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,170
methods to know that that that an

947
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:46,239
integrative approach is is ultimately

948
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,769
better for lots of reasons but no one's

949
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,549
specifically done that yet with CRISPR

950
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:50,550
technologies
