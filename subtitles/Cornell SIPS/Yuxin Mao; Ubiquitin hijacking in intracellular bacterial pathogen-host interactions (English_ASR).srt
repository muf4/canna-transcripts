1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,519
University thank you J for the

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,160
invitation so actually couple of weeks

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,759
ago Jan talked to me about the seminar

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,679
possibility here I'm kind of scared

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,600
because because you know bacteria and

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,719
the mammals and the plant are different

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,519
kingdoms right and I thought okay we are

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,038
different different kingdoms how that

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,079
can work here and but then I thought

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,399
okay anyway so we are all so the central

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,079
dogma between plants and the bacteria

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,079
and mammals they're the same right and

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,280
the particular also I think plants also

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,558
has ubiquity that's what feel like fine

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,239
we can do it that's something here and

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:50,479
uh okay here's my talk today so well

18
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,399
concentrate tell you about story about

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:57,078
how this bacteria hijack UIC system in

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,399
the host for the benefit of

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,600
infections okay so this is a bacteria

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,040
called Legion

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,719
num and you can look on

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,080
this um structure of this bacteria is

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,280
like a raw like bacteria it's a gram NE

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,118
gram negative intracellular passaging

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,439
actually it's not like a op it's not

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,879
like applicated human pathogen but

29
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:24,639
sometime it's a fresh host sorry it's

30
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,519
natural host is a fresh water amiba and

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,560
somehow when the people getting inhaled

32
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,039
The airos Source contain this bacteria

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
and then they will cause a disease acute

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,880
type of pneumonia disease called

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:43,960
legionar Puma or legionar

36
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:48,879
disease okay so now uh so this disease

37
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:50,679
actually first uh reported in uh 1976 I

38
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,319
guess so the the legion convention in

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,360
Philadelphia in the hotel and a big

40
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,758
ballroom and two 300 people in party

41
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,438
together and after that tons of people

42
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,039
get sick and eventually the CDC tsts

43
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,158
down what caused the disease it turned

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,280
out to be a bacteria and that's why the

45
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,080
Time Magazine has this Title Here

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,959
tracing the Philly killer and at that

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,760
party like 30 people died for this

48
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,719
infections and ever since then because

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,919
people aware of the disease and every

50
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:24,560
reported more and more cases every year

51
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,359
and uh there's a website actually uh all

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
cases reported to this website and you

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,400
can see a lot of it it happens all over

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,479
the world and every year all the time

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,640
and I remember heard you probably heard

56
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,399
the news too last year is downtown has a

57
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,759
explo kind of outbreak of the infection

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,599
too years here

59
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,719
um so now how they can cause the disease

60
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,799
so when the bacteria enter into L it

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,239
will pick up by the aviola microage

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
cells through the process called a

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,719
phagocytosis so the as bacteria get goes

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,479
into the

65
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,280
cells it has a weapon we call the type

66
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,759
of for secretion system so you can see

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,360
this needle penetrate the membrane which

68
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,759
engulfed this in circulate this bacteria

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,760
and the delivers tons of bacterial

70
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,039
proteins into the host the cytool and

71
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,120
then the magic happens basically they

72
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,798
just hijack VAR holster Pathways and we

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,158
can intercept vesicles derived from ER

74
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,920
and DEC on the surface of lcv the

75
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,438
secreted proteins they change the

76
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,919
identity of this

77
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:32,959
vacuums and then they can prevent

78
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,238
detections of by hosting immunity like a

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,759
Fus of endosome for degradation not

80
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,599
going to happen in this case because

81
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,438
they change the identity we hide the

82
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:44,039
bacteria inside this

83
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,598
vacuum and then basically expands and

84
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,598
takes the nutrients from the host the

85
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,719
back replicated inside the vacuum within

86
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,560
the cells and eventually it will life

87
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,840
the vacu life the cell and spread

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,759
infections so we do the infection in the

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,039
lab in tissue culture cells you can in

90
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:04,280
in incubate the bacteria with the tisue

91
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:07,078
culture within 24 hours almost like this

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,479
two3 of the cell c will be occupied by

93
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,680
this bacteria and then they will Li and

94
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:16,599
break the cells and they spread out the

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,879
bacteria so and as you can see briefly

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,879
this brief like um isogenic Pathways it

97
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,879
theend out if you look at it

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,160
molecularly oh sorry there too many l so

99
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,479
those bacterial proteins the whole cells

100
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,919
they are sort of a better cell biologist

101
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,279
than us they know all the cell cellular

102
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:41,879
mechanism cell Pathways they secreted

103
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,599
those weapons and they can deal with a

104
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,319
Hijra whatever variety of host Pathways

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,439
including lipids cytoskeleton ubiqutin

106
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:54,000
you can name it everything in the cells

107
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,079
in host cells the bacteria knows how to

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
manipulate and the benefit for their

109
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,079
growth

110
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,639
okay let's give you some example and

111
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,159
taste and initially we find actually

112
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,759
this bacteria secret this phosphatases

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,160
lipid phosphatases and those like CDP

114
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,240
and CDF they can specifically hydroly

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,680
those three species of the phosphor

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,120
inositide which in UK cariot maybe

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,639
implants the same thing it serves as a

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,600
like zip code for different kind of

119
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,319
organel inside the cell so initially the

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,439
foses have decorated with the pi3 p34 or

121
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,960
345 and the P3 C is the marker for

122
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,918
endosome so you need to get rid of three

123
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,839
and that's why the bacteria secret those

124
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,318
enzymes remove all three and eventually

125
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,198
also some people other people reported

126
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,960
as kindnesses here and they convert all

127
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:52,120
the phosph node into to pi4p which

128
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,120
enrich function as a marker for the uh

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,478
for G and er type of organal in the cell

130
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,160
and that's how they can hideen hide the

131
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,639
Spector inside of the vacuum now the

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,880
mimicking the host itself and that's why

133
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:09,319
they don't the host don't detect this

134
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,319
and just ignore this for for

135
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,918
degradation so now just give you another

136
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,960
flavor another example um to just to

137
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,799
show you how the bacteria is knowledge

138
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,519
of know that's so versatile knows

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,240
everything of the host and this is

140
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,159
another example they also can invade

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,879
exploit the host side of skeletons for

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
probably for the or or the or

143
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,598
trafficking within the cell after

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
getting into the cells so there's ex uh

145
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,959
there's an example here so this is the

146
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,799
effect called a mavage so it's very

147
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:50,079
simple protein uh it has a p3p binding

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,560
domains at Inus and and cus has a wh

149
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,198
like uh acting bining very simple

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,918
however when you add this liposomes

151
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,199
contained incubated this proteins and

152
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,439
also added to acting that shown in blue

153
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,560
here you can see this acting was

154
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,719
stimulated stimulated polymerization by

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,839
this effector and then you can see this

156
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,840
not only poly acting it also deforms

157
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,799
this membranes tubulates and it turn out

158
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,799
actually this effect Secret at a very

159
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,160
early time at during infections once the

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,879
bacteria make a contest with the host

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,120
and recuit actins and poly acting at the

162
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:32,439
contact size and polymer acting and

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,319
speed up the F phytosis process and

164
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:39,120
facilitate B entry into the

165
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,840
host so there's another example actually

166
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,478
which is right now actually on my lab

167
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,839
actually mainly focus on is that um this

168
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,918
bacteria also secrate numerous of

169
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,079
effectors they kind of muing or

170
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,240
manipulated host mitochondria so we know

171
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,800
mitochondria is the energy Hub and also

172
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,639
produce a lot of more metabolizes which

173
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,520
may be useful for the bacteria that's

174
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,840
why the bacteria needed to kind of

175
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:08,318
hijack or utilize the host rewiring the

176
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,959
host mitochondrial functions for their

177
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,479
benefit and we did some kind preliminary

178
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,038
predictions and we have like more than a

179
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,399
dozen of those factors probably local

180
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,918
secret and localized anchor to the to

181
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,359
the host mondra and change the function

182
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,799
of

183
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,360
mondra and just give you a little bit

184
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
example here so usually uh this is the

185
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
host MRA what it looks like in your

186
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,918
Carrio

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,038
and if you have some you will Express

188
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,598
the effector for example here the LPG

189
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,799
1803 it changed totally the morphology

190
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,800
of Metra and cause the aggregation of

191
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,240
Metra and another example for example

192
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:51,439
lamb 12 it also secr into the host

193
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,120
anchor or localized to the host and when

194
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,240
student studed this and he find out

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,440
actually once the this effector goes

196
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,879
into cells it recuit holds the

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
phosphotase to the mitochondri and Def

198
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,078
phosphor some proteins on the surface

199
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,958
and that's how they can inhibit

200
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,599
mitophagy basically stabiliz metaconda

201
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,479
and and inhibit myop so I don't have

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
detail I don't have time to cover in

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,839
details but uh this just give you a

204
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:20,120
taste of some examples how the bacteria

205
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,519
can can invade variety of host

206
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,519
Pathways but certainly for today's talk

207
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,799
I will mainly focus on another major

208
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,799
conserv pathway in you car which autop

209
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,319
pathway and again the bacteria secate

210
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:38,559
numerous infectors and rearing the host

211
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Ting system and for the benefit of a

212
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,879
grow inside

213
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,838
intracellularly okay so now we'll go

214
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,600
this more details if you before I I give

215
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,200
you some background here so if we just

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,120
look at the sequences of this bacteria

217
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,480
genome and you can identify some kind of

218
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,278
sequence homology uh some effector

219
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,399
actually including the fbox or U Box

220
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:04,200
which are part of the liquid Nation

221
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,639
Machinery proteins like e liases and and

222
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,240
they can probably some of them have been

223
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,480
tested actually they can function e

224
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,919
liases on the other hand there some

225
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,920
other effectors people can identify and

226
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,639
actually they can serve a function of

227
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,519
the

228
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,559
deines okay and um so overlab actually

229
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,519
at the first also identify another

230
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:28,319
unique type of heckle E3 liases which

231
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,078
represented by CDC and DCA and we'll

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
tell you the stories about how we narrow

233
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:35,278
down this E3 liases and how the

234
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,600
functions in the

235
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:41,958
cell okay so because of why as J

236
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,839
introduced my interest initially are

237
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:47,638
interesting phosphoros lipid signaling

238
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,040
and functions and we started this

239
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,560
because this protein and a big protein

240
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,319
secretor and only people knows it

241
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,559
combine pi4p and so The Binding of the

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,079
lipids it anchored on the surface of lcv

243
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,559
leg gener contining vacuum and besides

244
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,559
that nobody knows it's just really

245
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,759
totally blank so I since I trained as a

246
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,199
X3

247
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,958
crystallographer and so we solve the

248
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,040
structure of this proteins it turn out

249
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,799
this protein has multiple domains as you

250
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:21,078
can see from here and immediately find

251
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:23,838
the structure we can see

252
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,319
the a domain which in we call name the

253
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,600
p4c actually combine the

254
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,600
pi4p oh oh

255
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,759
okay now you can see so at so this P p4c

256
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,159
domain actually has four Al helican

257
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,600
bundle at the top of this is a pocket

258
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,199
which negativ positively charged which

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,800
ideally can fit into this phosphor inide

260
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,759
4 P four phosphate which is negatively

261
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,599
charged and this actually turn out to be

262
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,879
very specific and we find this actually

263
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,440
a lot of lab requested for this

264
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,679
constract as a probe you can use it as a

265
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,120
probe to to detect tected pi4p in

266
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,799
cells okay so this is the bind but

267
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,159
anness we have no idea it is this is a

268
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,439
structure and as a structure biologist

269
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,278
usually you are uh you will search the

270
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,320
database and see which one is similar to

271
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,120
this and then maybe you can infer any

272
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,839
functional um clues for this domain it

273
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,440
turn out this structure is unique

274
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,959
nothing similar to this and and we solve

275
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,720
the structure we kind of struggled for

276
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,719
like almost two years I have no idea

277
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,360
what it is and we Sol me to publish

278
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,759
paper without any function so until one

279
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,839
day suddenly that idea comes out so come

280
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,838
to us so basically we should analyze

281
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,360
also the primary sequence to see whether

282
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,600
or not there any conserved amino acid

283
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,079
right that's normally people do but it

284
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,278
turn out this protein actually about the

285
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:52,519
20 30% amino acid are sort of identical

286
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,000
across different leg gener species but

287
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,198
you only see them in general you don't

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,799
see any other or species for this

289
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,679
Protein that's why the homology quite

290
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,919
High

291
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,278
between leg species 20% is identical and

292
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,599
it's hard to see which one is

293
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,399
important but luckily we have the

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,839
structure we can map those identical

295
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,600
reses to the structure see what happens

296
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,160
with assumption that maybe this can

297
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,120
function the enzy and because if the

298
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,198
function of the enzy then us us should

299
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,799
see a surface patch which has a class of

300
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:28,120
identical conserved residues and indeed

301
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,838
excitingly we see when we do that we

302
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,278
immediately see the pocket

303
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,000
sort of a cluster on the surface here

304
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,559
which contains all the

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,078
identical residues not in other places

306
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,000
or majority of them actually embedded

307
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,198
inside the protein which probably is for

308
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,799
structural purpose but only here you see

309
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,599
the patch with conserved identical

310
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:51,198
residues if you look closely and they

311
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,920
have a hpo hist in system and I'm

312
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,278
teaching biochemistry you immed I see

313
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:59,439
this I so excited okay this must be a

314
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:01,159
system based prodct or thein or whatever

315
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
transfer which you have no idea what it

316
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,360
is and then we suddenly we order all

317
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,440
different kits and tested in test tube

318
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,079
to see whether or not we can detect any

319
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,959
activity but it turn out we cannot see

320
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,679
any of those activity so this kind of a

321
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,879
science just up and down sometimes

322
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,039
struggles and that's one struggle kind

323
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,198
of another second hit for us because we

324
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,198
have no idea what it is then we thought

325
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,120
okay maybe in the test tube we not

326
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:29,198
really know the the the indul substrates

327
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,240
we don't know even the conditions so

328
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,240
when should make the function so we

329
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,159
should do it in the cell and ask a cell

330
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,440
whether the was something whatever the

331
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,240
something happens so and before we do

332
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
that we have sort of idea maybe it's

333
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,440
related to uquid so we kind of Co

334
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,759
transfer transfer the cells with hqu

335
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,800
either with a Y type or mutant proteins

336
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,079
and we muted the system to Aly we saw

337
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,198
the system must be important right and

338
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,039
immediately you see from the gel we BL

339
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,919
the rest BL with h to see theing

340
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,919
patterns and you can

341
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:08,758
see some band Only appears in the Y type

342
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,879
but not in the mutant and the mutant one

343
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,759
you see some band disappeared in a white

344
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,679
type so that immediately tells you this

345
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,879
effect must have something to do with

346
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,399
the ubiquination passway right so with

347
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,078
the help of my neighbor Mark smoka they

348
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,839
do M back and exra MP and we try to

349
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,799
identify what are the change what you

350
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,920
know to ubiqus and sub you know the

351
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,318
bands prot changed it turned out among

352
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,958
the top 10

353
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:41,039
list seven of them actually relate to

354
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:43,000
e1s e2s okay it turn out so those in the

355
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,879
sales you always have this your Bitcoin

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,919
charge E2 and in the presence of CDC

357
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,799
this pool of ubiquity chart E2 was

358
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,318
diminished disappeared okay and that's

359
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,958
why and you can see if you this part is

360
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,198
gone and that's why some ination was

361
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,119
inhibited because you don't have Supply

362
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,519
U charge You2 that's why some band

363
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,159
suppos you should have and now it

364
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:12,519
disappeared and um instead these enzymes

365
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:18,078
or affectors they hijack Ubi take over U

366
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:20,519
from this e2s and go to the cell and now

367
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,559
it can record its own substrates and uin

368
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,480
is its own substrates Now find this

369
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,479
diagram or hypothesis you can see this

370
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,519
actually function as E3 Li is hijack

371
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,639
host uin and do it own you

372
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,159
be now with this idea it's much easier

373
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,399
you can now you have idea you can test

374
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,198
you can confirm this doing the test tube

375
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,159
so we can SE in the e1's e2s and e3s

376
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,159
here and immediately you can see the

377
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,679
robust pration happens with this e2s but

378
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:51,240
now with this E2 and with you

379
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:54,479
you7 is so robust almost all you be

380
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,198
could used up within like 30 minutes and

381
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,600
and also other yous also functions fine

382
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,719
okay so now that tells you in wow this

383
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,160
is like a

384
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,439
isas and then it comes to the next

385
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,038
question so C should place here as a us

386
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,360
liase so then we ask this structure or

387
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,720
protein like novel how this can function

388
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,438
as us liase so basically we asked how

389
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,838
does CDC can recognize e2s because E3

390
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,480
need recognize E2 and take over ubiquity

391
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,879
and how they can transfer you could find

392
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,079
you to to um it's substrate or

393
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,200
CC so we continue the mechanic studies

394
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,359
with a structural Sol a variety of

395
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,200
structures and you can see it turn out

396
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,240
that there's a green domain here and

397
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,360
specifically recognize this E2 which

398
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,839
shown pink here and then through the B

399
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:46,759
once it's bind to e2s the uquid which is

400
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,798
shown in yellow here will be recorded to

401
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,839
the active side which is here and

402
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,599
transfer between to the eies and further

403
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,599
on to its own

404
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,400
substrates okay so now with this it it

405
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,079
turn out it sounds like this is

406
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,080
CDC or SDC the two of them actually

407
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,960
paralog in in the same bacteria so it

408
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,558
secret and and the full structure

409
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,798
actually this active side is covered by

410
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,678
the p4c domain actually so it's not

411
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:17,679
active probably so then once it's secret

412
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,919
and sees the pi4p and this p4c domain

413
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,720
will bind the pi4p and opens up the

414
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,440
active side and maybe and you can start

415
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,360
um uation some substrates on the surface

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
or

417
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,279
nearby and we'll continue this later on

418
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,519
before I do that I will show you another

419
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:37,759
ubiquity kind of passway here so now as

420
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,440
I go back to this here so now we I just

421
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:44,839
present you our kind of identification

422
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,080
of this heck type is leges and

423
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:52,158
um recently actually there's another

424
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,359
family of this like eector and uh my

425
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,200
collaborator ding La lab from Pudu they

426
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,038
find that actually this four member

427
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,960
family of this city family like um it

428
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,919
also hijack host ubiquities but it

429
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,360
hijack ubiquities through a through a

430
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,960
very unique bizarre way as you can

431
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,199
appreciate from next

432
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,558
slide okay it turn out this is CD the

433
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,960
domain structure and there nothing that

434
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,720
no you like is domains anything like

435
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,038
like that it instead it has a a ADP raso

436
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,200
transfer domain and what it does

437
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:27,640
actually it specifically recognize

438
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,720
ubiquity and modify ubiquity use NAD and

439
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,080
this process we call the phosphor

440
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,600
ribocation so NAD can be used as

441
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:39,558
substrate and and then attach phosphor

442
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:43,319
ribos uh sorry um ADP Rivals to ubiqutin

443
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:46,119
very specific only to one restive AR 42

444
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:50,200
very unique only ubiquity only ar42 will

445
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,558
be modified by this domain the C vector

446
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,000
and then there's a second domain called

447
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:59,079
the phoso DI domain PD what it does

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,319
actually it further modify or converts

449
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:06,199
iiz away from the ADP ribos and what

450
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:09,319
left is phospho ribos phosphate and

451
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,319
attached phosphate to its substrate and

452
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,319
basically you do this ubiquination is

453
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:18,399
very different from canonical lysing

454
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:22,359
based isop linkage here is like a fosho

455
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,200
eser linkage so the this ubiquity now

456
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,678
attached to the substrate and also

457
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,159
there's a f variable in brid so we work

458
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,679
out the mechanisms and figure out how

459
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,760
this enzyme can do this unique we call a

460
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,000
phosphor ribos ubication pration so as

461
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,558
you can see from here so this enzyme

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,240
cleave the phosphate and release and

463
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,759
then the subst come in activated by this

464
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,720
hising so this is sering residues attack

465
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,640
the phosphate and now you can see the

466
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,400
form the linkage so this

467
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,960
uquid now through the aring through the

468
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,440
pentos and the phosphate attached to to

469
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,840
the to the Ser residues on the substrate

470
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,360
so that's what we call the phosphor

471
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,359
rioso

472
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,519
ubicon

473
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,400
okay and then it it turn out that the

474
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,440
four of them as I mentioned so all of

475
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,159
them can do the similar things can do

476
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
this which called the

477
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,880
phosphorilation

478
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,320
so but if you look at the the genom of

479
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,159
the bacteria so there other five

480
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,158
effectors contain this conserve the p

481
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,799
so we saw okay you know you look at

482
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,600
sequence all the Cal component reses all

483
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,918
identical we thought okay this PD can do

484
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,839
similar thing as do the ligations as we

485
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,919
just show you in previous

486
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:46,519
slide so the 10 n of them can do the

487
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,559
ligations but surprisingly to

488
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,798
us it do the reverse two of them can do

489
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,440
the reverse the pation as you can see

490
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,359
from appreci from this is experiment so

491
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,519
we can generate this phosphor Vos

492
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,759
species here so this is substrate this

493
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,400
phosphor rosate bands when you incubate

494
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:10,278
this phosphor R rosate species with this

495
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:14,080
D B you can see all the UIC form is gone

496
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,679
and another mutant and similarly so this

497
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,678
D A also incubator you all CLE them up

498
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,240
use up and another the mutant so that

499
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,519
tells you maybe this two actually

500
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,679
function to reverse the fos

501
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:32,200
um P reverse pation and and it also true

502
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,559
in during infections as you can see from

503
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,919
here so we do the infections you can see

504
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,879
we can enrich the substrate and in the

505
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:43,919
white type infection you can detect some

506
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:47,679
P species however if you delete this two

507
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,679
enzymes now you can see this P substrate

508
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000
really jumped high and it just

509
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,320
substantially

510
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,839
increased confirms this indeed rever

511
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,798
function of the dein specifically for

512
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,158
this phosphor your bation to this point

513
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,119
I want you can appreciate actually this

514
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,120
Legionella secrete those liases and do

515
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,678
this unique type phosphor we call a

516
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,678
phosphor uh ribos uation and they also

517
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,559
secret this doops to reverse the

518
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,440
activity to to Cle thisin found the

519
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,119
targets and and recycle this so just

520
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,240
like canical ubin you have lies in the

521
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,839
DS and the P has similar

522
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,759
Pathways to this point actually I have I

523
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,240
have to confess I'm so guilty for one of

524
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:36,079
my former students because we saw that

525
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,599
this is really unique in while we find

526
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,519
this in in the general species it's hard

527
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:43,798
to believe this only the nature only

528
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,359
created this Pathways Cycles only in one

529
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,720
species now in other organism or other

530
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:53,439
live species so we thought it must be

531
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,759
some other lives have this too and she

532
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,960
spend quite a long time but will never

533
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,519
detect any of this enzymes in other

534
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,079
organisms but maybe in plant they have

535
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,599
it but we didn't really spend time on

536
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,759
the plant species so this is unique it's

537
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,639
really hard to believe only this Legion

538
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,879
have this

539
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,360
Pathways so anyway so uh but this is not

540
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,520
end so on top of this cycle all this

541
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:23,359
like a Pathways cycle cyclical

542
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,079
Pathways um there's another layer of

543
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,918
complexity so this you look at the

544
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,038
genomes again so this is the bacteria

545
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,360
genome we have the A's and B's and the

546
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,480
C's so those are the leganes I just

547
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,839
present to you between the B and the C

548
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,440
there two other

549
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,918
genes nearby in between so usually in

550
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,120
bacteria so if the genes form a cluster

551
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,480
they almost the function probably likely

552
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,119
in the same passway right they probably

553
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,960
regula the same regular whatever

554
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:55,038
together um and indeed if you look at

555
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,960
what they are

556
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,798
one is a to a which is I just show you

557
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,038
is the

558
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:07,038
okay and another one called CJ and um

559
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:09,359
interestingly so CJ actually can rescue

560
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:13,240
the to suppressed activity of of this

561
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,719
ABC the leges as you can see here so

562
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,240
this leges when you express the yeast

563
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,480
and they are toxic yeast don't grow

564
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,880
however when you coexpress it yeah now

565
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,000
it regulates the toxic rescue the toxic

566
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,799
but now e the

567
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,679
control just to cut it short there too

568
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:35,960
too much storage behind this so the turn

569
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:39,120
out this here where here again we show

570
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,159
the pathways on top of this Pathways

571
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,000
this

572
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,399
CG you know con to another regulatory

573
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,440
paway basically the secret and bind host

574
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:53,678
codul activate and modify CDE and

575
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,038
inhibit activity of CDE so this we call

576
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,720
a glutamin and also there's other

577
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,640
effectors that can recycle this so

578
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,960
basically we have this pathway and on

579
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,120
top of that you also have a regulatory

580
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,679
circuit to control the activity and I

581
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,519
think there many labs contribut this

582
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,720
including ours this is really a new

583
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:16,119
pathway and that's why many a lot of

584
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,519
papers come out at almost at same same

585
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,359
time

586
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:24,679
um okay let's continue so now to this

587
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:29,079
point I just introduce you to you uh we

588
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:34,159
have U this conically Pathways and we

589
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:35,960
have this unique PR Pathways and we want

590
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,640
to ask whether or not this two different

591
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,759
pathways are they in totally independent

592
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,480
or they are they can cross talk with

593
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,798
each other the reason why why we ask

594
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,759
this the two folds actually because when

595
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,398
doing infections we do detect a lot of

596
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:54,879
UIC signals at the surface of lcv when

597
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:57,719
infected with Y type of bacteria but now

598
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,120
mutant and if you delete either CD

599
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,759
family or c c family those ubiqui

600
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,759
positive Vues are significantly reduced

601
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,599
so basically both of these two family

602
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,679
like is contributed to the signals at

603
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:14,798
the surface of the

604
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:17,360
lcv and also another fot of evidence

605
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,200
reasons why we sort the cross talk each

606
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,000
other because they modify similar

607
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,399
substrates and both for example RAB one

608
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,319
has been shown can be both Modified by

609
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:30,839
the pr PR Pathways and the chonic

610
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,359
passway too as it's showing here so you

611
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,158
can see when doing infections you can

612
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,398
see this substrate being ubiquinated you

613
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:41,120
delete the E families is reduced deleted

614
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,119
both it's almost all

615
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,240
gone okay so now we so ask if this

616
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,480
function together and modify the similar

617
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,839
substrates same substrates what kind of

618
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,480
uing structures or chains accumulate or

619
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,119
build up on the substrates so we saw

620
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,720
that here we come up with this kind of

621
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,879
model we

622
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,960
CDC can build up canic CH which directly

623
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,720
attach to the substrates and the CDE

624
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,840
they do this pation and again attached

625
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,000
to the Sim substrates and this also a

626
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,398
uqu molecule uqu also has license

627
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,159
available they can be further

628
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,558
ubiquinated by CDC that's why they

629
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,760
probably can continue build up elong

630
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,240
chain and this type of kind of

631
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,558
structures we kind of hypothesize that

632
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,440
maybe happens in the cell and to test

633
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,879
this model we now we can do this in vual

634
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,320
in the test table Al inil in the cells

635
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,240
so you can enrich or accumulate this U

636
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:38,439
substrates and then treat with a

637
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,159
canonical D which will cleav all the

638
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,399
isopeptide bond link ubiqui so you free

639
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,480
up ubiqui but only left this phosphor

640
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:49,239
Ros ubin attached to substrates right

641
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,519
and you can also treat with another enzy

642
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,440
D B which I just showed you it's a

643
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,440
specific Cleaves here be the linkage and

644
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,919
then if you do that now this ubicon

645
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,080
still maintain attached to the

646
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,038
substrates and then it will be released

647
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:06,720
with the different lens of

648
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:09,038
your chain so that this is the kind of

649
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,480
predictions and we do the experiment and

650
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:15,079
test res is true so Marina synthesize

651
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
this ubient species with both enzymes

652
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:20,240
and indeed after treated with dob you

653
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,480
see the mon uin which is here and some

654
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,120
uin is maintained which correspond to

655
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,000
this

656
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:30,038
substrate and then if you trade with d b

657
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,200
you see the mon d a little bit poly

658
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,798
which correspond to this part and you

659
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,960
have morein chain attached to the

660
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:38,440
substrate which correspond to this one

661
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,558
and if you certainly if you treat with

662
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,519
both enzymes you all collas into moning

663
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,480
and almost all gone so indeed so those

664
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,720
ubin you have two enzymes they build up

665
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,798
this kind of uine chain mixed ubin chain

666
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,399
we

667
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:56,599
call and then in the cells you have this

668
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:59,798
mix U chain and we know in the cells we

669
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:03,719
have autop machineries we can detect the

670
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,918
ubin and send this for AutoPage

671
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,399
degradation that's usually happen in the

672
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,600
cell and the bacteria is not that stupid

673
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:14,398
they know actually they know what how to

674
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,959
avoid this but how we don't know because

675
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,678
this ubiquity this should be recognized

676
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,278
by uqu adapters and it can be degraded

677
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,399
by the autop

678
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:26,759
pathways to to ask this we kind of have

679
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,439
go back to the activity of this enzymes

680
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,119
so this can do the like P ligations but

681
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
sometime in the absence of a substrate

682
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,639
and in the person of water molecules

683
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,558
actually do the cleavage too so now if

684
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,038
this phosphor was cleaved by water

685
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,079
molecules it will left phosphor ribos

686
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,079
attached to

687
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,720
Ubi so which means this ubiquity

688
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:51,079
probably be modified by CDE with

689
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,278
phosphor varibles on aine 42 and by this

690
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:57,278
modifications you may kind of a mask

691
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:58,960
uence and the block recognition by The

692
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,359
Host

693
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,399
adapters and first we'll test verify

694
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:07,599
this where not this true this uin be

695
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:10,558
modified indeed we have uin chains

696
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:13,558
synthesized and then you can use a we

697
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,720
call a pro phosphor protein Q staining

698
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,918
you can only detect the free and the

699
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,919
phosphate attached to the proteins and

700
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,320
indeed those uin chains are light up

701
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,960
lights up indicating in the presence of

702
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:31,398
the C SDA or C C indicating those indeed

703
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:35,159
those uin modified with phos pentos

704
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:38,638
phosphate and also it's true inval and

705
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,559
invit or in both is true we use Ubi

706
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:44,119
substrat and we CLE with Dot and now we

707
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:47,158
can analyze ubiqus again this uqu you

708
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:51,038
can see in the presence of a c SDA CD

709
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,240
which basically you can see this UB be

710
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,960
modified and then we also confirm the

711
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Mach back and this is the true so

712
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,480
basically

713
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,240
oh so this uin be modified that's why

714
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,519
they can prevent The Binding recognition

715
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,000
by the U adapters and prevent Auto

716
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,120
degradation and indeed if you look at

717
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,278
the uquid binding by this adaptive

718
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:15,558
proteins U domain bind ubiqutin and

719
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,759
oxygen 4 42 right at the interface and

720
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:20,918
you can imagine if do 42 be modified

721
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,720
with ADP Rios or phosphor Rios and there

722
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,960
a sterical collisions here this block

723
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,360
The Binding and indeed when you do The

724
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,880
Binding assays you can see if the UB be

725
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,240
modified there's no binding here and you

726
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,360
can otherwise this actually can you pull

727
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,880
down by the p uh uba domains and also

728
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,079
when doing infections just is too

729
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,080
complicated just focus on the two l two

730
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:49,240
lanes here so this uin species is a lot

731
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,918
but yet there's no P p62 bind to this

732
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,720
ubin species if you deleted the CDE

733
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,159
family even though theing species are

734
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,720
being reduced dramatically you can still

735
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:04,559
see dramatic binding with

736
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,038
p62 okay so and this is also um

737
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:10,798
consistent with the Imaging data you can

738
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:13,638
see why type of infections no to be

739
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,398
recruited to the lcv and but you delete

740
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:19,918
the

741
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:22,599
C be uh pp62 positive lcvs significantly

742
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,600
increased here as you can

743
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,599
see

744
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,839
so okay I'm kind of speed up a little

745
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,839
bit here so to this end so now this

746
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,839
actually we understand now so B what

747
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,759
kind of uin sign build chains buil up at

748
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,959
the surface of lcv and this actually is

749
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,759
mixed and also m is being modified and

750
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,639
that's how they can prevent the host

751
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:51,398
recognition prevent Auto degradation but

752
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:53,199
you may ask why you need this if you

753
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:55,038
don't have uin not going to it's not

754
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,759
going to detected by autopia anyway so

755
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,359
why you needed this uin build up at the

756
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,038
surface and and then you need and then

757
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,359
modify them prevent recognition so there

758
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,278
must be some physiological functions

759
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:11,440
associated with this uquid this mixed

760
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:13,320
Ting chain here right to um uh indeed

761
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,000
actually when we do the infections if

762
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,679
you look at the recruitment of er

763
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,280
material or ER vesicles to the lcv in a

764
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,838
Y

765
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,919
type the M okay you can detect a lot of

766
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:28,878
sorry a lot of lcvs are positive for

767
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,398
those ER materials ER

768
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:34,078
markers if you delete either of the two

769
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:36,480
family of Li cases those y markers will

770
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,919
be reduced deleted both of them been

771
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,760
reduced to the almost to the do mutant

772
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,759
which totally block the secretion of the

773
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,000
effector

774
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,040
proteins so that tells you sounds like

775
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,760
you this ubiquity chance you build up

776
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:54,480
the surface also serves as a kind of a

777
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,839
recruiting mechanism to recruit year

778
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,400
vesicles to the lcv so basically now you

779
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,960
go that to this model so this you can

780
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,680
imagine this ubient chain build up and

781
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,320
actually ubiquity within the chain maybe

782
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:11,559
they can use up to cross link a second

783
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,240
substrate so this phosphor Rosal linkage

784
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,639
if this we can attach it to the first

785
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:19,759
substrate which anchor RCV and this one

786
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:23,400
anchor ER vesicles so now you can you

787
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,680
can imagine this chain SES as anchoring

788
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,079
molecules and Bridge up together the two

789
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:32,239
different um proteins and and breach the

790
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,160
vesicles recruited to the

791
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:38,000
lcv and um okay good so I just cutting

792
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,399
the short indeed probably is true

793
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,920
because we can detect those cross

794
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,838
linking of the two different substrate

795
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,480
within the same uine chain so you can

796
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,759
basically you can do the infections you

797
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,079
can pull down one substrate you can also

798
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,760
detect the second one and when you do

799
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,079
the after you when you do the Cleaves

800
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,760
you can release the

801
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:00,400
free um second substrate in free and

802
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,920
indeed when you do this AES um if you

803
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,838
just focus on this two lanes here so

804
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,920
this the uh uqu species is also positive

805
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,000
for the second substrat and if you do

806
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,280
the cleavage you can see this subsec

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,358
substrate was released from the same

808
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,720
material here either with do a or D or

809
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,199
clonic D or do B either one you can

810
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,879
release the second substrates from the

811
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,039
UB

812
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,519
species Okay so and certainly whether or

813
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,960
not this Ting change so that anchor

814
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,719
still need certainly need more evidence

815
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,599
more experiments will continue invest

816
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:43,279
investigated in uh this idea so but but

817
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:47,000
anyway I will stop here and just

818
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,280
summarize what we presented so far and I

819
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,599
told you this bacteria secret many many

820
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,079
factors and they can really they the

821
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,800
best to sale B than us and they knows

822
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,160
everything they they can manipulate

823
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,839
lipids and manipulate acting

824
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,679
cytoskeleton and mitochondria which I'm

825
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,559
still working on and to I present you

826
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,759
more in details about the two UB

827
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,838
Pathways and this two uqu passway

828
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,640
function together they build up um sort

829
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,400
of a mixed uine chains like MH work on

830
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:19,159
the surface of lcv not only they can

831
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,400
protect the bacteria from host

832
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:25,358
degradation but also probably can serve

833
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,559
as a anchoring scaffolder to record host

834
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:31,318
materials or vesicles

835
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,119
and okay by the end I will see some

836
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:37,519
peoples uh I Cann knowledge actually I

837
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,680
do see um some of the former members and

838
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,639
some new members and I don't have time

839
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,318
to go in details sorry for that and also

840
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,279
some collaboratives and the foundings

841
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:51,400
and I will stop here and hopefully it's

842
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:55,400
not too late and welcome any

843
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,519
questions question that you show

844
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,480
Target yeah and why is that is that

845
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:02,639
really a Target why is that a Target

846
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,800
like do you have any idea like why rap

847
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:09,480
teally should be degraded as like as

848
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:12,318
opposed to being a partner um and is

849
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,838
there any other Target for this effector

850
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:17,960
and do any of these proteins have any

851
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:21,000
role to towards

852
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,960
236s protos or

853
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,400
isulation basically only works for for

854
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,079
autop like as a sofr for autop not for

855
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,160
yeah maybe I'm not clear with this it

856
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,640
the turn out

857
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,279
um this tines are not for prote

858
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:41,719
degradation the purpose is not for

859
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,839
degrade any degrade any proteins around

860
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:49,159
CV totally not for degradation

861
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:52,239
um so in term of substrat we did mess

862
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:54,519
back with both ccs and sdas you will see

863
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:58,279
a numerous of effectors which many of

864
00:38:54,519 --> 00:39:00,358
this actually ER proteins and some

865
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,319
proteins involved in membran trafficking

866
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:06,358
like rap small gdps and many others and

867
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:10,880
there's also some of the subst that kind

868
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:13,679
of a common for each leges and we

869
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,160
believe those there's no specificity for

870
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,960
those targets the only I think it more

871
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,639
likely the based on the geometry based

872
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,760
on the space the vicinity so because

873
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:26,639
those enzym been secreted it's all

874
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,240
localized on the surface IV whatever

875
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,799
protein nearby they can be modified and

876
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,159
the modification not for degradation

877
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,760
instead they probably just build up

878
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,440
ubing mes as a protecting shell and also

879
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,880
serves as I mentioned as anchor

880
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,000
anchoring scaffold and recuit other

881
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,720
proteins cross linking other proteins so

882
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,719
is that answer

883
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,440
you membran that yeah it's possible some

884
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,599
that's why some initial vesicle can be

885
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,519
recuited through other mechanism and

886
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,280
this you modifi and stabiliz

887
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:07,639
more tily like Co me just attachment

888
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,640
together yes yes

889
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
please

890
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,838
as

891
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,838
why do like why

892
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:31,039
do why they Rec materal

893
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,400
yeah so the the bacteria need to grow

894
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,400
right when into the cell initially the

895
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,119
the fome is very tight it's really

896
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,400
tightly bounded only the bacteria size

897
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,440
eventually as I mentioned 24 hours

898
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,960
expanding enormously like two s of

899
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,960
second occupied by this vacuum you need

900
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,039
membrane need materials to enlarge the

901
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,480
space enlarge the niche it's more like

902
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,159
transfer one that's probably one the

903
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,679
mechanism recuit year vesicles fuse them

904
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,679
eventually big bigger

905
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,280
and related around that contact site or

906
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,440
whatever yeah that's a good idea we

907
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,359
never look at it yet but maybe we have I

908
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,519
have no idea yet and nobody reported

909
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:19,598
that any liid transfer protein involved

910
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,480
in this process or not that's certainly

911
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,000
could be a future direction for you can

912
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,000
investigate yeah yes please

913
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:38,719
it has and c and the Cy are and then

914
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,920
degraded and that's how the cell

915
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:45,519
progress right so if ubiqutin are

916
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,358
hijacked are the cell arrested in the

917
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,358
same

918
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,799
stage uh I'm I'm not sure I understand

919
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:56,078
quite well your question could you

920
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,079
repeat again oration

921
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:05,000
pathway leads to cell arrest because

922
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:08,480
cyclings they will not be degraded oh

923
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,318
okay um I have no idea whether or not

924
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,079
interfere with other host uation

925
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:16,480
Pathways it only so far I present here

926
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,800
it just utilize Ubi it hijack clost to

927
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,920
Ubi and use it for its own build up this

928
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,000
meas work the cell know the cing or

929
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,720
other Pathways during infections I don't

930
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,358
know whether or another they

931
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:34,679
to what degree the impacted by this uine

932
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,838
lius is I have no idea yeah and also the

933
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:39,598
infection cycle is quite short like 24

934
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:42,599
hours you're down and I'm not sure can

935
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,200
affecting cell cycles or not I I have no

936
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,079
idea

937
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:52,159
can yeah can we let's say these proteins

938
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:54,480
yeah that hijack the utin to let's say

939
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,440
treat cancer or something because it

940
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,358
will not let cycl to degrade and the

941
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,480
cell will remain in the same stage yeah

942
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,838
that's a good idea I always saw when I

943
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,639
working on this we call weapons this are

944
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:11,719
really unique tools you can you dissect

945
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:13,519
the host cells and um but somehow those

946
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,239
enzymes are quite toxic to the host if

947
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,480
you overexpress them the host is not

948
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,639
happy the cell going to die really

949
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,800
indeed for example this is really robust

950
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,558
you ere expr too much in the cells and

951
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,079
just use up all bin and just just hijack

952
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:32,359
everything and similarly this like is

953
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,960
also too you toxify bination system

954
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,679
ination yeah it could be if you use a

955
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,760
small month you can develop this as a

956
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:42,639
tool you can disect use it to manipul in

957
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,839
different ways As You

958
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,519
Wish okay fascinating talk um I'm

959
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,039
intrigued by the fact that the Sid C and

960
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,639
S A are basically only found in leg

961
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,719
janelas what do you think their

962
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:59,799
evolutionary origin is yeah usually

963
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,919
people believe believe uh those gen so

964
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,359
the bacteria acquired from the original

965
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,440
Asian host so we call it like a gene

966
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:09,199
trans direct horizontal Gene transfer

967
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,519
but now through Evolution this you know

968
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,719
evolved in bacteria and now the sequence

969
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,318
all the other features maybe evolve some

970
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,679
new ones and but totally different from

971
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,079
you host now it's totally different now

972
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,519
you cannot see any sequence and even

973
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,640
structure wise you don't see them

974
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,838
anymore yeah but how nature created

975
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:29,480
those and whether or not again this is

976
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,039
still posibly me whether not maybe other

977
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,920
spe has this pass or not we still have

978
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,759
no idea and I know several lab try to

979
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,000
invest this and nobody reported of far

980
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,680
whether or not other species has those

981
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,480
uh pathway or not maybe plan has it I

982
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:51,039
hope yeah

983
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,039
okay yeah plan passing may we also have

984
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:59,959
it this has been a production of Cornell

985
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,960
University on the web at Corel n.edu
