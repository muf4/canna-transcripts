00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:03,347
This is a production of Cornell University.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,204
&gt;&gt; Today we're going to be

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:11,445
examining the physical properties of soil.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,065
As we mentioned before,

5
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:16,905
most soils are made up of three particle sizes.

6
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,289
Sand, which is the largest size,

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,960
silt, which is a very small size of sand.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,595
You can think of it that way.

9
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,820
And clay, which is the very smallest size particle,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,765
which is wafered and cannot see it to the naked eye.

11
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,990
The way those particles come together, sand, silt,

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,690
and clay gives us the texture of the soil.

13
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,549
Texture is actually the percentage of sand,

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,204
silt, and clay in any particular soil.

15
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:46,189
Why this is important is that the way

16
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,890
the particles come together give you the porosity,

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,615
the amount of pore space that allow water to move in the soil.

18
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:56,690
This demonstration is aimed at showing you how

19
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,598
water moves in different textures,

20
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:04,144
if you'd like, of soil using sponges as proxies for soil.

21
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:07,188
As you can see, this kitchen sponge it's got pore space,

22
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:12,139
it's got solids, it's got air,

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,820
which is a good proxy for soil,

24
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,604
which is about 50 percent solid,

25
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:21,530
25 percent water, and 25 percent air in a idealized situation.

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,070
We can use these sponges with different pore sizes

27
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:29,349
to tell us how water moves in soils.

28
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:34,250
What I'm going to do here first is take this kitchen sponge,

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,640
put it underwater, and squeeze all the air out of it.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,790
I let it open under water,

31
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,424
and then I'll bring it up into the air.

32
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:52,939
The point where there's no more air in the sponge,

33
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,579
just water, is called saturation.

34
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,619
Saturation is when the all the pores are filled with water.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,160
But of course, as soon as I bring it out of the water,

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,929
it starts to drain.

37
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,595
Drain via gravity.

38
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,060
Gravity is pulling the water from the sponge down.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,705
We've still got plenty of water in the sponge.

40
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:18,110
Even though gravity is still there,

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,180
it's not being able to pull more water from this sponge.

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,230
At that point, soon that these drips have stopped,

43
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,289
we call that field capacity,

44
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,984
which is the amount of water a soil can hold against gravity,

45
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:37,970
basically hold within its pores.

46
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,129
This is field capacity now.

47
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,335
Basically most of the water is gone.

48
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,784
Free water is gone by gravity.

49
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:49,039
What I mean free water is the water in the big pores,

50
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,689
which are called macro pores,

51
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,329
that are free to move via gravity.

52
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,960
The water in the small pores called micro pores,

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,080
are holding onto that water so that they're

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,945
not able to be taken away by gravity.

55
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,329
So, this is field capacity.

56
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,215
This is the amount of water this sponge or the soil can hold.

57
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:12,229
If we want to say, well,

58
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,369
now it's able for the roots to get that water from the soil.

59
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm going to pretend I'm a root down,

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,180
so I squeeze the sponge.

61
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,230
If I'm a root, getting the water from this sponge,

62
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,234
which would be by osmosis.

63
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,320
But we're just pretending.

64
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,319
I'm just squeezing the sponge

65
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,074
until I can't really squeeze anymore water out of it.

66
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:41,839
There's still plenty of water in this sponge,

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,534
as you can all imagine.

68
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:47,569
But it's held so tightly by the pores that

69
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,680
roots are not able to get that water by osmosis.

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,550
At that point, we call this the permanent wilting point,

71
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,635
where the soil has water in it,

72
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:01,879
but it's held so tightly that roots cannot get the water.

73
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,609
Between field capacity, which

74
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,070
is after gravity drains the free water

75
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,799
away and where I squeeze

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,130
the water and you cannot get any more water off of the sponge.

77
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,209
We call that the available water holding capacity of the soil.

78
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,500
That's the amount of water in a particular soil.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,995
It varies from soil to soil,

80
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:26,090
can hold against gravity and was

81
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,234
holding so tightly in the pores that roots can't get it.

82
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:36,595
Different soils have different available water holding capacities.

83
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,245
I'm going to take this other sponge here,

84
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,220
which is a yellow, really big, poor sponge.

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,735
You can see this sponge here.

86
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:49,430
It's much more open than the orange sponge.

87
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,030
I open it under water again as I did with the orange sponge;

88
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,439
squeeze all the air out.

89
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,329
Let the water fill the pores.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Much more water is coming out via gravity than the orange sponge.

91
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,915
Because there's lots of big pores which

92
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:11,855
allow more gravity to pull that water down.

93
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,735
The small pores hold the water.

94
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:18,780
The big pores allow the water to go down.

95
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,439
And then, if I were to squeeze this sponge,

96
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,310
there's not very much water that's actually left in it.

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,550
In fact, the available water holding capacity of

98
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,460
this sponge will be much less than this sponge.

99
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:39,019
Why is there still water left in the sponge after I squeeze it?

100
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,089
That's because of the forces of adhesion and cohesion.

101
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,389
Cohesion is the attractiveness of water to itself,

102
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,409
water attempts to bead up when it's on a surface.

103
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,715
But adhesion is the attractiveness of a solid surface to water.

104
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:58,554
This is critical when you have small pores,

105
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:02,905
there's lots of forces of adhesion holding the water in the pores.

106
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,859
Where you get further and further from a solid surface like in

107
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,949
a big pore the water is then able to move via gravity.

108
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,370
Because the forces of adhesion are being overwhelmed by

109
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,709
the fact that the water is further away from the solid surface.

110
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,979
It's interesting to look at

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,389
some different types of sponges to see

112
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,240
what water holding capacity we can actually measure.

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,710
I have three sponges here.

114
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,204
I have a kitchen sponge like the orange one,

115
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:38,599
and I have the yellow one like the very big poor one.

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,740
I have a white sponge which has very, very small pores in it.

117
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:48,349
I tried to cut

118
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,245
them so they are equal volume because that would be important.

119
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,574
More volume, more water.

120
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:57,344
I'm going to do the same thing we did before.

121
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:00,060
I've squeezed the sponge under water.

122
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,655
We'll start with the kitchen sponge.

123
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:05,369
Let it come out under water.

124
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,860
That's the amount of water that's being drained via gravity.

125
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,350
The big pores are basically

126
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:19,585
letting their water go through the sponge,

127
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:23,389
until we get to a point where water's being held so tightly in

128
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,800
this sponge that gravity cannot pull it away.

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,305
This again, if you recall,

130
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,894
this is field capacity

131
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:39,998
where free water is drained away by gravity.

132
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,980
That means the water in the big pores.

133
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,160
What's left is water in the smaller pores which is being

134
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,260
held via adhesion by the adhesive forces against gravity.

135
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:57,209
Let's measure, what was

136
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:06,149
held in that sponge till I can't squeeze anymore against gravity.

137
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:08,629
This is what is called the available water holding capacity.

138
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,379
I'm just going to make it slightly pink so you can see

139
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,800
it in the graduated cylinder.

140
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:25,810
We see we have 90 milliliters of water.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,829
Okay. Let's look at the other sponges.

142
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,980
We can predict if that orange sponge has really big pores,

143
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,534
that most of the water will be removed by gravity.

144
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,759
We wouldn't have as much held by adhesion.

145
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,470
After that, we will see,

146
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,615
because this is science.

147
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,990
We're going to squeeze the orange sponge underwater.

148
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,634
Let it fill all the pores with water.

149
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,553
We let it drain via gravity

150
00:08:54,553 --> 00:09:01,679
until we have no more water draining via gravity.

151
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,870
All the water in the sponge is held by

152
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,784
the adhesive forces of a solid surface to water.

153
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,829
Here we are now.

154
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,610
We're going to squeeze this sponge,

155
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,620
which has the biggest pores into this tray.

156
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,470
Color it so you can see it.

157
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,915
I'll take this other graduated cylinder.

158
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:32,349
I'm going to pour the water into this.

159
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:37,939
Here we see that the available water holding capacity is much

160
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,530
less because the big pores are allowing water to move via gravity.

161
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,564
We have about 60 milliliters of water here,

162
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:51,170
versus we had 90 in the medium-sized,

163
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:57,604
the sponge with more smaller pores, I should say.

164
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:01,009
The third sponge is this very tight,

165
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,529
very small-pored sponge,

166
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,750
which I'm going to squeeze under water.

167
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,034
I'm going to let all the air out.

168
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,699
Let the pores fill with water.

169
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:17,779
Very little actually is pulled

170
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,424
via gravity because all the pores are very small,

171
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,349
holding the water to their solid surfaces.

172
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,970
Let's see how much water this sponge holds.

173
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,890
You'd predict that this would be the one that

174
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,004
has the most water holding capacity because

175
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:44,220
all those small pores are holding water very tightly.

176
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:51,230
Let's measure that. Now we're at 120 milliliters of

177
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,200
water for the sponge with

178
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,259
a very small pores or the soil with very small pores,

179
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,360
which is a clay or silty soil,

180
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,653
where you can say that the green sponge

181
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,860
would be more like a sandy loam,

182
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,620
has more sand and bigger pores.

183
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,894
The orange sponge would be like a sand, and have very little water holding capacity.

184
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,199
All this is doing is telling us how

185
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
these soils act regards to water,

186
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,560
water movement, and water retention in terms of

187
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,219
what the plants going to use for available water holding capacity.
