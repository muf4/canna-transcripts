1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:18,649
thank you done good morning everyone can

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:21,509
you hear me okay thank you my title says

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:30,838
potato variety diversity attributes and

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:35,760
partners needs in Ethiopia probably most

7
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:38,820
of you know where eta is Ethiopia is all

8
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,089
the former name Abyssinia that is the

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:50,730
center of diversity of more than 18 16

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:53,070
crops like sorghum tape nope like that

11
00:00:50,729 --> 00:01:00,328
that is the center of diversity of more

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:03,989
than 16 crops in the world but potato is

13
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,420
not endemic teacher bhea it is believed

14
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:13,319
that it is originated or introduced

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:16,859
about 150 years ago so this green shaded

16
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:20,188
area is very suitable for potato

17
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:24,868
production it is estimated about 3

18
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:26,699
million Hector so probably tripura has

19
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,340
possibly the highest potential of potato

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,909
production in sub-saharan Africa so just

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,960
the trend also the potato rh expansion

22
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:42,329
also shows that in 1970s potato

23
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:46,938
production was 30,000 Hector but in 2014

24
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:50,959
it was 179,000 Hector it is about

25
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:53,908
six-fold increment this is because

26
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,489
potato is a very good food security crop

27
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,890
because it is early maturing I yield and

28
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:04,259
it is good for food in Ethiopia however

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,960
however the productivity potato is

30
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,389
decreasing through time nowadays it is

31
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:14,759
about tent and practice when compared

32
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:17,129
with 40 tons per hectare when we compare

33
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,649
North American productivity

34
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:24,210
european potato productivities about 9

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:27,599
10 / octa it is very very small and even

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:31,770
the productivity will be decreased even

37
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:36,590
parser because of these problems drought

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,300
is aggravated through time late blight

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,349
especially the main positive business in

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,990
ethiopia is devastating and aggravated

41
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,219
through time and depletion of soil

42
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:54,510
fertility because of soil erosion is

43
00:02:49,219 --> 00:03:00,509
aggravated so this this causes this this

44
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:06,120
problems also really make potato potato

45
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:07,979
crop decreasing even further the

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,890
Ethiopian agricultural research system

47
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:15,329
established in especially the potato

48
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,919
program stablished in 1975 and to

49
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,750
increase the productivity of the crop

50
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:24,899
released 31 new potato varieties with

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,349
assumption that local varieties are low

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:33,719
yielding and they have narrow genetic

53
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:37,639
base and with assumption that these

54
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,289
improved varieties are released for

55
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,299
selected for their yield and late blight

56
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:45,269
resistance these are the major selection

57
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,469
criteria for the research system and the

58
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,909
other recommendations the research

59
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:53,849
system did a shift planting seasons to

60
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:58,280
rainy season because in the in the rain

61
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:02,340
in the dry season in the dry season the

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:06,270
rainfall status is not is not dependable

63
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,240
for potato gross so the research system

64
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:13,709
recommend this the dry season production

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,920
to main racism production we have four

66
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,850
growing seasons in in Ethiopia the bulk

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:24,480
balamani mehar and muslim baloch bulmer

68
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,300
and machine or dry seasons the this one

69
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,650
is the main rain season

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,180
so the research system recommend this

71
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:35,489
instead of planting rotate on these

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,259
seasons planting potatoes and this is

73
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:44,478
using the main new varieties is a good

74
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,479
strategy based on the research system

75
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,288
but how is the farmers response for this

76
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:54,479
research recommendations the new

77
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:58,318
varieties have not been accepted in most

78
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:01,228
of the farmers as expected what is the

79
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,580
reason behind farmers want to grow local

80
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:07,228
varieties rather than new varieties

81
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:10,680
farmers still grow potato in the dry

82
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:20,180
season done in the new season what is

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:27,000
the reason behind so to see those

84
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:30,810
problems we propose about for research

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
objectives the first one is assessment

86
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,038
of local varieties their distribution

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,709
and importance in different technologies

88
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,478
the second one identify farmer variety

89
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,120
needs in different area colleges

90
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,709
cropping systems and market access the

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,228
served one determined genetic

92
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:49,560
relationship PQ locality and varieties

93
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:51,269
with different sources in the world the

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,278
first one is measure the relative

95
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,649
tolerance opt up and potato variety to

96
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:58,439
water stress stress using screeners

97
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:01,799
experiment so to attain these objectives

98
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:06,778
we conducted a series of objectives will

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,848
come to that that one so the first one

100
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:10,709
the first research activity it is

101
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:12,478
published in American Journal potato

102
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,638
research it says positive variety

103
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,579
diversity determinants and implication

104
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,800
potato breeding strategy in Ethiopia we

105
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:24,389
did a survey we did a survey for six

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,348
districts representing different agri

107
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:33,658
ecologists for example the ligands this

108
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:37,610
is very dry area and these two are moist

109
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:41,389
areas these are some humid this are

110
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,400
this area is by it uses bimodal airport

111
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,639
and it is cool Highland this is mid

112
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,728
altitude area and the partners targets

113
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,870
products potato for the market and in

114
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:57,620
this just in this district new variety

115
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,780
intervention is in high status so the

116
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,780
survey contains semi semi-structured

117
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:09,758
interviews focus group discussions fill

118
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:14,000
and storage observations so we recorded

119
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,158
those local varieties and new varieties

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,959
new varieties which I mean those

121
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:24,740
varieties released by the research

122
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:28,870
system so far so about 14 varieties are

123
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,629
grown in different areas of the country

124
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:36,769
and the major varieties differed between

125
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:39,439
districts for example in chambana this a

126
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:42,378
gather and not java are the main two

127
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,319
varieties and these varieties are widely

128
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:48,740
marketed in Addis Ababa market in the

129
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,990
northwest these three varieties are

130
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,439
below the Korean simoni are the main one

131
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,478
and in Google and data this variety are

132
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:05,959
the main one so we have 14 number of

133
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:10,610
local varieties and in when you come to

134
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:14,538
the new varieties about six varieties

135
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:20,270
are recorded and grown but three

136
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:22,579
varieties are widely grown CSI and good

137
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:24,318
and end of a letter from sirt1 new

138
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:28,068
varieties only three varieties that is

139
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,289
nine percent of them are adopted so the

140
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:35,750
aggregates area locator to new varieties

141
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:38,269
is qe3 percent when you see the number

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:44,539
of valid is grown per household most of

143
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:49,509
the farmers grow potato grow more than

144
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:52,289
one varieties for example somewhere some

145
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:56,049
most of the farmers in boomer n decatur

146
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:58,809
grow more than forty forty percent of or

147
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:04,629
more than that farmers grow three or

148
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:06,459
more varieties this is for risk

149
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,570
avoidance and for some some

150
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:14,230
characteristics I'll come through it

151
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,960
with in a minute so each local varieties

152
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,960
how have its own specific

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,960
characteristics and in each other I

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,850
ecology farmers have varieties for

155
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,910
different purposes farmers have

156
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,700
varieties for drought tolerance farmers

157
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:36,219
have varieties for adaptation to low

158
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:39,490
soil fertility especially in remote

159
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:44,830
areas in remote areas where chemical

160
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:50,799
fertilizer is not a main main issue a

161
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:53,320
main source and farmers have late blight

162
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:58,959
resistance varieties varieties with

163
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:04,930
storage qualities and farmers have

164
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,730
varieties for market and dazzles we also

165
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,429
recorded potato production practices

166
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,909
practices because this is helpful to

167
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:16,419
understand the farmers needs so when we

168
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:19,419
see the those farmers who apply

169
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:25,089
fertilizer especially in two districts

170
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:27,399
is the banja they don t is fertilizer at

171
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:32,170
all and I gained about fifty eight

172
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:36,699
percent and from even even from those

173
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:39,539
farmers who use chemical fertilizer most

174
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,640
of the farmers use diammonium phosphate

175
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:46,059
instead of urea but the research

176
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,639
recommendation is both both die ammonium

177
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:52,089
phosphate and yer eyes the commended but

178
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,909
most of the farmers want to use only

179
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:58,740
diammonium phosphate

180
00:10:53,909 --> 00:11:02,089
and most of the farmers do not use them

181
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:08,789
aside for later black except a shaman in

182
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:12,810
gamma ray Nikita farmers when we come to

183
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:15,299
seed source most of the farmers use

184
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:17,369
their own heat source especially in

185
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:21,839
Goomer and gate amala ninety percent of

186
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,560
the partners the farms used their own

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,379
seat especially in the High Line this

188
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,750
market also have its own sure especially

189
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,889
in the highland areas it is quarried

190
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,440
about 3,100 meter above sea level and

191
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:39,779
lie kind it's also very cool Highland in

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,540
this year as there is no bacterial wilt

193
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:50,399
reported so far so this in these areas

194
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:53,279
market share each has its own clay okay

195
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,559
the second the second of my act ii our

196
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,519
activities evolution of genetic

197
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:02,129
diversity of ethiopian potato germplasm

198
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:05,699
we collected 44 local varieties with

199
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:09,929
supporting information that is the the

200
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:12,270
traitors so far most rates and for how

201
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:15,149
many years they they they produce these

202
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,340
these varieties so we we collected from

203
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,590
Northwest Ethiopia and thousand Ethiopia

204
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,530
because these two locations represent

205
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:27,180
more than seventy percent of the potato

206
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:29,610
area in Ethiopia so we used molecular

207
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:33,259
characterization and morphological

208
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,550
characterization DNA was isolated from

209
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:39,870
European Port Authority and local

210
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:43,439
varieties and sip 31c varieties and we

211
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:48,750
did this using C dub protocol in in

212
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:54,510
Ethiopia and clarified using question in

213
00:12:48,750 --> 00:13:00,659
Walter lab and genotype it in 8300 slip

214
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:03,429
marker using alumina array and sleeps

215
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:07,059
from 20 to 22 American and 70

216
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:11,319
european collins also included and from

217
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:15,879
these markers we used this this amount

218
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:18,870
of snips in case of morphological

219
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,490
characters we collected those 44

220
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,100
varieties and planted in the screen

221
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,070
house and evaluated about for the flower

222
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,509
characteristic for stream and other

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,020
plant characteristic sugar

224
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:41,039
characteristics to confirm our DNA

225
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:44,649
structure DNA result is fine so from 44

226
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:48,639
local varieties about 15 varieties are

227
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:55,480
unique the rest are duplicates named

228
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:57,669
duplicates for example Sakura this is

229
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,600
this variety is well known in the

230
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:04,719
northwest it's also grown in the south

231
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,209
it is it has six names in different

232
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,839
areas it is called Kate energy Lagrange

233
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:14,139
Merton Mercer in Banja demas inquiry

234
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:22,540
dimensional a terrible i need mana kind

235
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:28,000
in / Koji and the wearer so I'm a show

236
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:31,569
you this this is sakura so this is valid

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,190
is widely grown in ethiopia and the

238
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:39,490
other the other 1a below this also

239
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:43,390
widely grown and the z's variety about

240
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,870
double it has a very very good fever

241
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:49,360
ship but the farmers do not want to grow

242
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,659
this variety it is reported that it is

243
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,990
drought tolerant variety but it has a

244
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:57,719
bitter taste

245
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:00,539
that is the main program and the natural

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:08,210
white is widely seen in Addis Ababa

247
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:11,579
market this is so we also grouped

248
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:17,300
Ethiopian varieties in relation to

249
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,300
European American and super varieties

250
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,690
this is super varieties group we have

251
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:28,919
three groups within the cluster analysis

252
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:32,360
this is the seed group this is American

253
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,799
group the black this European group

254
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,139
Ethiopian varieties are found in two

255
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:42,509
groups in CP groups and European group

256
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:45,779
especially the oldest varieties like a

257
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:49,769
below simoni nadroga Rhodri me these are

258
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,980
in the European groups the latest in

259
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:57,809
local varieties in CP group this makes

260
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,730
sense because 35 years ago ETA PR

261
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,919
introduced potato varieties from

262
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,240
European countries not from sip after

263
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:10,349
than most of Ethiopian research system

264
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,310
introduced potato varieties from sheep

265
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:19,889
and probably's these varieties may be

266
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:23,250
derived from cheap sources the principal

267
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,509
component analysis also showed the same

268
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,799
trend the Ethiopian varieties are

269
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:33,539
located in the sim and European sources

270
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:37,079
but the American sources are widely

271
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:42,870
distributed and is a hetero zygosity

272
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:46,650
also showed American sources are highly

273
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,470
heterozygous followed by European and if

274
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:53,639
European sources are better than cheap

275
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,259
sources and when we see the FST taste it

276
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,649
hippin sources it happened clones are

277
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:08,470
closely related to

278
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:11,500
sip and European than American so the

279
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,328
search activity it says genetic

280
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,909
variation potato growth and yield

281
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:18,328
response to water stress during cool and

282
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:23,140
warm season production Northwest area I

283
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:26,558
told you we have four seasons and we

284
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,610
were we wanted to taste especially those

285
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:34,139
those highly drought-affected seasons

286
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:39,729
bulk and mass now we want to taste

287
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:43,090
different varieties on these seasons so

288
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,880
we arranged our reports that is the poet

289
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:51,038
experiment we arranged the pots in 40

290
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:56,110
applications so each each treatment has

291
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:59,528
two ports this is a radiated one in the

292
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:02,889
green red and the red the red port are

293
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:06,579
the stressed one and we used water

294
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,788
markets and tensiometer Xin storage but

295
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:13,778
in this tensor meters are not function

296
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:17,460
well we used water marks water molecules

297
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:20,169
can monitor monitor the moisture level

298
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,230
the moisture level greater than minus

299
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:26,470
zero point zero three mega Pascal will

300
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:31,120
be related less than this one will be

301
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:35,558
stressed but the the port is the plant

302
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:39,158
is who rigged ate it uniformly until 40

303
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:41,849
days and then stressed again for 41 days

304
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,850
like that

305
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:53,639
so the result shows that this this is

306
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,819
the Sakura is a widely grown variety so

307
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:58,859
we can use this one at it as a check so

308
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:04,980
this is a German variety it is reported

309
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:08,158
to have good drought tolerance so no

310
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:12,419
variety hour till the disease local this

311
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,639
local check but in warmer season this

312
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,659
varieties really it has a very good

313
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:22,829
potential when compared with this 111

314
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:26,389
gram per plant and this variety gave 209

315
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:30,990
grant program is very good drought

316
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:34,258
tolerance ability when we see the water

317
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,159
stress susceptibility index in the

318
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:43,288
National cool season some varieties

319
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:45,539
balada a new variety a part in a local

320
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:48,450
variety it is reported to have good

321
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:52,230
drought tolerance and a bad Ramu I

322
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:56,090
should I told you previously these are

323
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:59,940
very good load sub suitability index in

324
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:02,908
ambala go season this variety new

325
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:09,720
variety and this a German variety has

326
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:12,649
very good tolerance to drought and yeah

327
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,000
the loan the number is the better yeah

328
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:18,500
when you see the granule and the

329
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,839
pictures some in the trust treatment

330
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,000
some tubers have a good marketable size

331
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,298
but not this one as this variety

332
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:34,829
nutburger oh is very susceptible look

333
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:44,069
the it reaches 1.5 x ESO value and we

334
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:46,168
cannot find marketable supersize when

335
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:50,069
you see the percent and marketable small

336
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:52,980
size tubers comparing with the check so

337
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:58,558
quarry this variety about the moon a

338
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:01,110
local variety this granola this sip

339
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,259
advanced real or because we included

340
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:07,138
this variety because it it has a good

341
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,669
tolerance to drought and Guerra and a

342
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:14,028
new variety released for

343
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,028
drought-stricken areas has a very good a

344
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:24,298
high number of low number of small

345
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:28,769
tippers in both Messina and Burke when

346
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:33,808
we see the army analysis that is the

347
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:37,618
same trend this granola a bad damu this

348
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:40,618
has it they fit well to the warm season

349
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:43,589
condition to Balak season and the this

350
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:49,829
the regime china sequeira is good for

351
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:55,618
the snow or cool season when you see the

352
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:59,878
correlation matrix anyway those were

353
00:21:55,618 --> 00:22:02,118
those traits in relation to yield market

354
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:05,878
a virtue variant and total to variant

355
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:12,658
those stem with above-ground biomass and

356
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:16,349
leaf area ratio has have a negative

357
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:21,409
relationship with yield but harvest

358
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:25,519
index has a positive relationship with

359
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,519
marketable and total Jabbar unit

360
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,900
then this is my last presentation man

361
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,089
last activity identification of armor

362
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,490
priorities in potato products through

363
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:47,278
parts part of our isolation this is

364
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:50,579
accepted for publication and we used PBS

365
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:53,788
approach the previous approach uses

366
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:56,970
first situation analysis search for

367
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:59,129
varieties and experimentation this one

368
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,640
is related to experimentation hood

369
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:05,880
because we we we did situation analysis

370
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,778
in our survey and we did search for

371
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:15,260
varieties in our second experiment that

372
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:15,259
is evolution genetic evaluation trans

373
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:26,759
because of this this study is intended

374
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:30,089
to find out really the local varieties

375
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:34,079
are low yielding we need to test that

376
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:36,000
and we need to test that why the

377
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,089
partners do not want to grow in the dry

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,849
season and the research recommendation

379
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:45,298
in the weight season why not we need to

380
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:49,168
check that and we need to find out what

381
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:51,960
are the farmers and variety needs so we

382
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:54,210
used two districts in the highlanders

383
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,120
with different degree college one is dry

384
00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:00,870
in the other weight and we used diverse

385
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,538
set of varieties from local and from new

386
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:06,689
varieties and we organized farmers

387
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:11,269
research groups we organized Varmus

388
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:17,009
research groups each group has 40

389
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:20,548
certina 39 members each each group has

390
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:24,778
sown chair and secretary and they

391
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:28,019
evaluated the varieties in the flowering

392
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:35,398
stage in the harvesting stage and after

393
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:40,609
three months after storage this is like

394
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:44,959
an area this is ill man area so we

395
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:50,788
grouped based on gender probably we

396
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:59,120
wanted to see the gender issues here so

397
00:24:50,788 --> 00:25:05,369
we we recorded those but 23 one treats

398
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:09,839
to to collect these 23 trades first we

399
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:12,839
asked farmers which are the best five

400
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:16,529
varieties and what is the reason behind

401
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,178
and we also asked them what are the bad

402
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:21,629
performing varieties what is the reason

403
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:24,419
behind so these all these traitors are

404
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:28,100
recorded from those reasons and we

405
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:31,909
record those reasons and we the partners

406
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:35,730
evaluated those those those traits again

407
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:40,159
so we have mail ratings here we're

408
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:46,759
familiar things in each in each location

409
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:49,559
so from here high yield long shelf life

410
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,898
because long shelf-life varieties are

411
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:55,678
very important especially these are very

412
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:57,989
determining trades for variety

413
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,360
acceptance in each API the research

414
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,380
system didn't want to see this this one

415
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:07,288
they simply see the yield and a little

416
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,860
blind but the farmers really consider

417
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:12,690
this is a very important trait and

418
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:15,959
suitable for sequential are wasting the

419
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:19,200
farmers want to use one to harvest two

420
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,778
times at least in the one firm in one

421
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,730
growing season drought tolerance

422
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:27,690
low-salt soil fertility adaptation

423
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:33,450
especially in ligand the males are males

424
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:36,990
are very they have a very good concern

425
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,120
in soil fertility adaptation late blight

426
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,089
resistance suitability to boiling

427
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,750
suitability to sue steel that is for

428
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:46,189
source

429
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,710
these are the main the main domain

430
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,308
trades and are also another another

431
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:56,590
place market demand especially in in

432
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:59,629
mana tolerance to wind and hail damage

433
00:26:56,589 --> 00:27:09,230
fixed aims these are very very important

434
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:12,799
traits so so we tested in the in the

435
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:17,110
field we tested the yield of local

436
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:20,389
varieties and new varieties so it's

437
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:23,269
really Ethiopian local varieties are

438
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,830
longer than the new varieties we can see

439
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:32,269
the Java byte is about 24 ton character

440
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:35,269
but here in the in the new varieties we

441
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:40,579
cannot get uniform so the new varieties

442
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:43,069
are not low yielding and in case of

443
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:44,210
seasons because we will taste the two

444
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:47,798
seasons at the right season that

445
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:52,100
Isabella mark and the main rain season

446
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:55,250
so those late maturing varieties fit

447
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:58,599
well to the velimir season because this

448
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:01,519
barracks needs long maturation time

449
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,579
Ballmer season is a long much muttering

450
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,950
period the short early maturing

451
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:09,798
varieties our feet well to the mercies

452
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,110
endure the main rain season so it is

453
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:14,720
impossible to recommend those late

454
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:20,839
maturing varieties to grow in the manor

455
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,490
in season so our conclusion in case of

456
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,579
potato genetic research resource

457
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:28,779
assessment we record the European major

458
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:32,928
varieties privacy's maybe the first

459
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:35,928
report their distribution meritus in

460
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:39,950
ethiopia number of ballots grown per

461
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:41,809
household and reasons documented genetic

462
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,169
variation among each other varieties and

463
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:50,240
our outside clones are documented our

464
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:52,220
study also negative the belief that a

465
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,400
tape and varieties have neurogenetic

466
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,400
piece

467
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,289
so if your pian varieties does not have

468
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,640
a narrow genetic base based on our study

469
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:04,500
the yield response of selected local

470
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,980
products under water stress is

471
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,390
documented this finding also negates the

472
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,630
believes I type and level collaborators

473
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,950
are low yielding they are not loading

474
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:20,130
probably because if you can we started

475
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,670
with this tester seat probably those

476
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,550
those seeds probably infected that may

477
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:29,310
be the reason for low yield but in our

478
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:32,309
study it will be a local varieties some

479
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:36,720
of the violets at least they're good

480
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:40,519
good as new varieties in case of

481
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,440
production systems four seasons recorded

482
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:50,150
we named one season because there was a

483
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:53,759
confusion we call it velimir season so

484
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:56,940
there is a confusion this velimir season

485
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:00,000
some people say it is mad some people

486
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:04,549
say that is called balik but it is

487
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,359
ambition so we we call it belmar season

488
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:08,519
differences in growing season between

489
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,639
potato growing server regions where

490
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,700
documented major potato production

491
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,400
challenges and their importance are

492
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:20,940
recorded in case of farmers variety

493
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:24,120
needs we give answers why liberation or

494
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,600
are not accepted as expected now where

495
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:31,379
we have answers about that primal farmer

496
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,509
cited 23 traits are important key

497
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,210
variety traits differ among our ecology

498
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:39,569
calzones cropping systems and market

499
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,779
rates for example Northwest needs

500
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:47,399
another variety especially Northwest

501
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:50,970
needs long story varieties South farmers

502
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,280
need quick dormancy varieties so there

503
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:57,480
is a difference in demand of varieties

504
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:02,230
so we have recommendations these

505
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,298
recommendations that is it is the

506
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,029
it is good to register the main tube and

507
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:08,789
Ethiopian local varieties and prepare

508
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:12,480
and eat you can put it or color catalog

509
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:14,918
with some pictures utilize the major

510
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,069
available major varieties for future

511
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,850
building multiplied visa status testers

512
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:23,409
starter seed of major far more varieties

513
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:25,509
incorporates additional quality and

514
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,690
stress tolerance rate during variety

515
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:31,329
development and address the violation in

516
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:36,490
a gray ecology cropping systems market

517
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:39,089
access during variety development so we

518
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,289
have an occluded an acknowledgement asst

519

520
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:51,659
kaha programs because without this

521
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,298
program I would not be here so I tank

527
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,270
thank you rly thank you so much indeed

528
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,960
questions sly

529
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,400
one question that I hadn't thought of

530
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:32,079
before which was you found it only a

531
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,780
small number of the varieties you looked

532
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:41,159
at were genetically distinct there's 14

533
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:44,529
out of from 44 for pound fifteen million

534
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:49,420
but when you design your water stress

535
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:52,420
experiment you didn't know that that

536
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,640
that that information came later so were

537
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,370
the varieties that you chose for the

538
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:03,130
water stress experiment today were they

539
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:08,799
all in week varieties that were not the

540
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:12,430
same yeah I sure all of my body's in the

541
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:18,519
waters Poisson unit during one at first

542
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:20,710
we included some but we remove later

543
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:24,339
because we move another two instruments

544
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:26,140
what is so meaty pretty subtle you

545
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:29,319
remove some because you found out that

546
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:32,440
they were so yeah because I remember we

547
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:35,889
included two varieties that is unlucky

548
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,630
me and after the molecular

549
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,430
characterization this virus have the

550
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,430
same and we won

551
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,650
so as you continue to vote move on with

552
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,049
future breeding programs what kind of

553
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,790
trans leave prior an eclipse on our your

554
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:55,789
first straits that you decided

555
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:02,070
it's very good very good question

556
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:06,849
because in internet access system

557
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:13,509
because I am utterly and when you have

558
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:16,480
focused on the end and let life but I

559
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:20,260
understand now not right now these two

560
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,148
are not only that the truth rates are

561
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:27,339
not only this true story is the mint

562
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:33,250
because the virus want to store four

563
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:36,639
elements for food so for example about

564
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,329
why I'm always ready known by the

565
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,329
pharmacy lobby because it is it can

566
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:47,980
escape to use in the soil that's very

567
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:53,889
unique variety so storage is the main

568
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:57,148
one storage tray and some other traits

569
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,149
like travel to us

570
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,989
this is based on the ongoing college

571
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:05,539
conditions market or so so its own body

572
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:08,478
for example where you go in sha sha na

573
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:11,539
na this totally fit yet if you want to

574
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:14,868
introduce today the skin body go and use

575
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:17,239
that one nor no one wants to go registry

576
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:20,479
my ready because it is depending on the

577
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:25,159
the market to market to market 97 one

578
00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:29,239
uses five the scale bar X so the harvest

579
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:32,778
drugs I accept those legs kill my ex

580
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:37,278
lifetime so what is also in social

581
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:40,088
storage payment is cloud and get like

582
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:40,088
absorbs a major

583
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,449
which of your results do you think will

584
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,349
surprise the Ethiopian research

585
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:49,349
community the most

586
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:02,739
the the first one is genetic the genetic

587
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,710
diversity analysis because in so many

588
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:11,108
photos I have seen that for examples of

589
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:17,460
body so Cory reported six times as soon

590
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:23,519
as new by different lines so most of the

591
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:27,460
44 local varieties are considered as

592
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:30,699
identical piles so our our bracelet

593
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:33,460
shows that most of them are in case this

594
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:36,578
is a very good very good i sensing and

595
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:40,900
the other thing is that local bars are

596
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:45,250
not alone in our results shows that

597
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:49,108
local bars are not really and even if

598
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:54,030
you can localize have some some

599
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:57,460
diversity within within the country

600
00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:00,780
these are the release two important

601
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,780
messages that

602
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:10,050
i watch out without eyes have a

603
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:14,460
follow-up question when you begin your

604
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,930
research did you think the local

605
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,519
varieties were low yielding and you

606
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:21,118
think there were so many different local

607
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,369
varieties there are only a few but

608
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,480
there's a lot of duplication local

609
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:28,858
varieties when you begin your research

610
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,909
having been Ethiopian contain a

611
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:34,500
researcher for a long time were you

612
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:42,029
expecting this was this a surprise to

613
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:46,710
you too yeah even even even those high

614
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:51,359
in variety or loca- alex m very few but

615
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:53,340
since they have a good athletes but you

616
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,819
have not gave these activities of these

617
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:01,890
traits from new bodies for example the

618
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:06,539
trace will get from a body still who

619
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:09,509
cannot gain we don't get these trails

620
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:16,289
from lubar I any kind of all right if I

621
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:19,350
don't and we we have also some bodies in

622
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:22,108
the eastern part of Italy I hope so

623
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:24,210
especially that Traum tolerance they

624
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:26,279
make some important product but I didn't

625
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:31,590
taste them because I have no time to

626
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,869
resign from the near future I am going

627
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,920
to do that and i am going to correlate

628
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,869
those car varieties in the eastern if

629
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,440
you

630
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:49,200
das and even we we have we have some

631
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,170
something local varieties in the

632
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:55,439
centrality and some lights are not

633
00:38:52,170 --> 00:39:01,740
included in the latest analysis because

634
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:05,608
we didn't taste within we found some

635
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:07,828
after game analysis so I believe some

636
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:12,269
very important local policies are very

637
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:18,289
good for closing purpose but that is

638
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:18,289
more but it can be starting

639
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,280
great to see that

640
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,949
women barbers in here

641
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,490
wonder if you could help me understand

642
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:38,379
how much decision power they have

643
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:38,379
termini varieties actually get plenty

644
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:51,400
especially in one location the partners

645
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:56,680
tournament at the demons are responsible

646
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:59,769
for selecting tubers and that are very

647
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:07,480
good in identifying by despair estates

648
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:10,659
and for example in a treat sequential

649
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:15,610
harvesting trade this is a very

650
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:19,750
important trait for women done with the

651
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:25,240
wind rated g street hi that me because

652
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:29,579
and then that does have concern for the

653
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:35,229
food for the supply in the like idea so

654
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:38,440
the high-power track safe and they can

655
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:42,849
lead but we cannot totally say humans

656
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:47,710
are can't decide but in some in some

657
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:52,110
farmers and some farmer some women

658
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:55,789
partners are also independent observer

659
00:40:52,110 --> 00:41:01,940
husband so they can they can decide

660
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:07,880
which by a candle so mighty fine art

661
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:09,889
remember sequential art sequential are

662
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:16,940
bursting for example in one growing

663
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:18,829
season the moving zone means zoning goes

664
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:21,920
further to the field especially in

665
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:27,860
development season in August in the

666
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:33,139
august season during around maturation

667
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:36,590
but not fully much they go to the field

668
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:38,809
and harvests Angeles and covers the

669
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,519
suena game but they they drooped

670
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:46,190
disturbs the rules and this is stolen

671
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:49,280
they they took some bigger tours and

672
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,510
covers the swinging and after tweakers

673
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,810
after two weeks they go back again and

674
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:59,900
harvest some chores if you guys like

675
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:04,420
that situation are harvesting that is a

676
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:07,880
very good trait for women parties

677
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:12,860
because it is a good means it means for

678
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:16,190
food security become in August you

679
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:18,110
cannot find in from harvest data that's

680
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:24,530
why what it is a very very good khlo

681
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:30,440
because if mattress in august june july

682
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:32,320
august is a very serious manses for

683
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,929
solid food for this evening

684
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:38,590
and his Harvard anchoring in monsey is

685
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:40,539
called hungry with this segment so what

686
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:45,610
you do is only called harvested between

687
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:53,679
that man so that's why we say but it is

688
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:59,289
a good call see ya what can be done

689
00:42:53,679 --> 00:43:02,049
about why verson see when we visited we

690
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:06,630
saw feels for you know how to be kept

691
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,630
like 75 percentage of all disease

692
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:22,210
before I included our bodies to our

693
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:25,960
research activities we tasted the

694
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:29,949
varieties for these 46 viruses and one

695
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,849
battery and more than eighty percent of

696
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:39,489
our collection is inflicted by biased

697
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:43,900
that's very sad so for example for one

698
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:47,588
variety Agatha we found some tangibles

699
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:51,160
113 because we collected from different

700
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:54,489
sources so only what you were we thought

701
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:58,420
only want you so we multiply the screen

702
00:43:54,489 --> 00:44:04,568
out in vitro and Miss canals to get up

703
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:07,139
get a motor tours so this is it is

704
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:12,960
really very very challenging part and

705
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:15,940
even the study even if we use clean seas

706
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:21,460
we can increase if you're a positive

707
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:26,338
program by 50 person so most of Egypt

708
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,338
and farms are rated by buyers and

709
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:34,050
mr. government's trying to start up was

710
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:38,939
a seat multiplication problems oops

711
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:45,210
reduce the virus phone

712
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:48,130
there are some seats production schemes

713
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:52,960
especially energy especially from

714
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:55,660
netherlands and as a call cause i

715
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:01,960
usually concentrate on New Balance North

716
00:44:55,659 --> 00:45:05,289
local minds and we have to tissue

717
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:09,760
cultures facilities in Ethiopia what is

718
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:13,480
it polenta is about 27 this reservoir is

719
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,270
a bargain and they are working to

720
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,440
multiply from if more than 40,000

721
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:24,639
minotaurs per year and they focus on new

722
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:29,559
buyers don't log online but after after

723
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:31,389
my my work in the national potato Center

724
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,699
particular from international consider

725
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:41,789
Center took some sugars minute words

726
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:44,980
from my collection to multiply is

727
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:48,599
probably that week

728
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:54,309
future but our capacities very limited

729
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:57,069
that's why farmers use only their own

730
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:59,349
seems every time probably turning years

731
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:05,800
or something is that usually use their

732
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:09,929
own seed so that that's one of the

733
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,930
causes for food or a filter

734
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:19,409
and the other question through some

735
00:46:17,228 --> 00:46:19,408
minor

736
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:29,590
thank you very much too much thank you

737
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:32,380
your schedule for the common my views on

738
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:35,410
the airplane is 6am this has been a

739
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:38,760
production of Cornell University on the

740
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:38,759
web at cornell edu
