00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,039
traditional gas powered tools to

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,839
Advanced electric Alternatives um this

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,719
narrative is not only about my personal

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,640
um Evolution but also about the

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,960
collective Journey um of our industry as

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,439
a whole Let's Travel back to

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,679
1997 the year I boldly adventured into

21
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,320
um the world of landscape in with the

22
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,519
establishment of est's Country Gardens

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,040
and design fueled by a passion and a

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,118
desire to create stunning outdoor

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,159
Landscaping spaces I made the first my

26
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,840
first significant investment which was a

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,520
John Deere Diamond blade cut off saw um

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,359
I was so excited about the that tool and

29
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,679
what it was going to accomplish me it

30
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:29,719
was sort of like getting my my first car

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,840
um I used that it became an integral

32
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:35,519
part part of um who I was in my projects

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,118
um use it to cut cut concrete and create

34
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,879
beautiful landscapes um all over New

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:44,040
York and even into Ohio um it became an

36
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,560
integral part of my my identity however

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,439
as I reflect on my career I cannot

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,079
ignore I cannot ignore the toll that

39
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,039
demand of that industry has taken on me

40
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,919
it goes beyond the physical labor uh my

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,640
experience highlighted in the cost

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,478
associated with using gas power tools

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,718
after after years of relying on that

44
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,039
reliable demo saw and other gas power

45
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:11,400
equipment I now find myself wearing

46
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:14,000
hearing aids um despite my constant use

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,200
um of hearing protection um it was

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
insufficient to prevent um hearing loss

49
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,318
um which I have

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,318
suffered reminding us of the numerous

51
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,479
challenges that um are faced with the

52
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,759
the landscape industry that my fellow

53
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,359
colleagues um deal with every day

54
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,799
um and the profession as a whole as it

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,319
resonates with me additionally we all

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,239
can ENC we all can have encountered that

57
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,399
moment of irritation haven't we that

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,120
frustration of reaching for a gas power

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,200
tool and to find out it won't

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,158
start it refused to start you twist the

61
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,399
cord you pull on it you check the fuel

62
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,318
and sometimes out of sheer annoyance you

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,519
resort to a bit of uh some colorful

64
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:02,639
language

65
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,158
um I can't count the times that I

66
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,359
paddled a um a tool that um was in

67
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:12,158
Cooperative um that precious you know

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,959

you work D diligently to try to

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,400
transfer that leads me to a pivotal

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,080
moment in my career that I transitioned

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,039
from Electric to Electric Tools gladly

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,480

bothered by the the sound of a growling

99
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,918
you know gas engine convenience is

100
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,560
another factor to

101
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:41,918
consider Electric Tools operate with

these tool require far less maintenance

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,639
and they are much easier to operate this

108
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,478
means we canote less time to

109
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,680
troubleshooting and more time to what

110
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,959
truly

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,959
matters our

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,319
craft I've discovered that my

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,478
efficiencies with the gas power tool

114
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,519
away from the gas power TRS allow me to

115
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,360
compete complete more swiftly and um do

116
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,198
additional work because of that not

117
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,038
having to do deal with that annoyance

118
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
nevertheless transitioning to Electric

119
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,959
Tools is not without

120
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,840
hurdles for many Professionals in our

121
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,000
field the prospects of making this

122
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,119
switch can feel overwhelming one of the

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,319
most significant challenges is the

124
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,639
initial

125
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,919
Financial outlays that go on with the

126
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,960
transitioning to Electric Tools they

127
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:48,639
often come with a higher price tag um to

128
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,959
the the gas power counterparts and

129
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
canose a substantial obstacle for some

130
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,918
small business businesses and

131
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,039
independent landscapers that manage

132
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:00,719
tight financials constraints

133
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,959
additionally there's the adjust adment

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,160
period associated with transitioning

135
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,959
from a gas power tool that you've relied

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,160
on for you know years and decades um to

137
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,120
the to transition to Electric Tool

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,520
particularly if there's a you you been

139
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,120
relying on that for so long comfort and

140
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:23,079
familiary breed a sense of

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,639
security and you're stepping into a

142
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,959
little bit of unknown um battery life is

143
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,079
another concern while advancements in

144
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,318
Battery Technology have enhan

145
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,959
the viability of Electric Tools some

146
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,560
landscapers worry about the running

147
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,439
running out of power mid project which

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,399
can lead to you know delays and

149
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,399
frustrations like you did with the the

150
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,638
gas power tool now let's G delve deeper

151
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,399
into the

152
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,680
tradeoffs concerning costs it's truly

153
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,519
that the initial investment of Electric

154
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Tools can be higher however it's crucial

155
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,959
to consider the long-term savings that

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,319
come with this their use gas power tools

157
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:08,159
often carry hidden expenses you have the

158
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,520
fuel you have oil you know regular

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
maintenance it can accumulate over over

160
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,318
time and be

161
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,240
significant not to mention the repairs

162
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,039
required for gas power engines I can't

163
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,000
tell you how many car carburetors I've

164
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,959
repaired and with tools um and those

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,319
intricate expenses that are associated

166
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,038
with the gas power

167
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,039
tool conversely Electric Tools typically

168
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,800
offer a more economical operational

169
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,759
model the cost of electricity is often

170
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,680
