1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:09,869
University welcome you to the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:16,339
restoration ecology 2017 cohorts

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:16,339
presentation of their class project and

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,960
one of the objects of the project is to

6
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:27,469
expose the students to experience or

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,829
learning a situation where you know you

8
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:33,050
try once you fail you try twice you fail

9
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:35,329
and then by the third or fourth time you

10
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,518
finally get it figured out how you

11
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:40,128
actually should do it and what looks

12
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:43,149
really good on a blackboard or

13
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:47,210
whiteboard in a classroom situation

14
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:51,798
changes very rapidly when you are in hip

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:54,710
waders and you are in mud maybe up to

16
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:57,588
your knees and say well maybe I can only

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:03,649
do one of these sample sites or maybe I

18
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:05,959
can only collect one kind of sample what

19
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:09,700
we're looking at right now is one of

20
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,280
many drone over flights that we did of

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:18,859
its it's called treeman Lake or Lake

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:29,090
Freeman it's more like Tremont lake and

23
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:32,719
marsh complex this is the dam and so we

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,820
were we were able to do a number of very

25
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,250
interesting things over the past several

26
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,269
months including these drilling over

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,760
points and we spent a lot of time

28
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:45,890
canoeing around and sampling the

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,450
vegetation and collecting soil samples

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,030
and so forth so before we actually get

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,060
started I'm going to encourage everyone

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,579
to grab a bite to eat if you haven't

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,820
already done so Aaron anybody still need

34
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:07,170
lunch

35
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:09,609
okay okay this is this is the class Wow

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,490
they look a little bit different than

37
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:19,180
they do at 8:30 on a Tuesday morning

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:22,450
it's it's it's really good to see

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,659
everyone all of you and all of them and

40
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:29,859
check this out there are two members of

41
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:33,280
the class standing in the middle of a

42
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,670
little Peninsula on the marsh so I'm

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:42,360
going to turn things over to class

44
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:47,279
members right now and Audrey oh okay

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,890
Audrey was our TA this year good job

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,229
keeping me honest and making sure that

47
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:59,589
we didn't leave things behind we didn't

48
00:02:53,229 --> 00:03:01,929
lose any students so Audrey you wanna do

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,610
your introduction in there thank you all

50
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,969
very much for coming today this is

51
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,959
exciting we spent a fall semester

52
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,789
working together a lot and it's

53
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,099
wonderful to see you come together so

54
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:15,519
thank you I'd like to begin with some

55
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,229
history so starting around 1930 the

56
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,209
Civilian Conservation Corps but in the

57
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:22,209
dam and what was buttermilk cream

58
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,250
creating like treatment and so slowly

59
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,769
over the years the area has been

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,659
familiar with settlement just like the

61
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,099
southern end of the Finger Lakes they've

62
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,039
been filling the segment ever since the

63
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:36,009
glaciers and so they've Truman is really

64
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,219
a community asset it provides ecosystem

65
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,060
services like sediment mitigation and -

66
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,799
speak louder

67
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,159
of course the sediment is trapped via

68
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,080
the dam and go down

69
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,379
or like how you got this is really

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,630
helpful to the community over time the

71
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,710
area has change from glacial to Creek to

72
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,560
link and now we see it slowly

73
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,330
transitioning into a wetland marsh the

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,219
question now is what we want the system

75
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,190
to do what it can do for us what we

76
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,590
would like when talking with the New

77
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:09,479
York State Park Department we decided to

78
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,150
address a couple of important issues for

79
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,469
managing the area first and foremost we

80
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,510
wanted to estimate the depth of the

81
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:18,540
water and the volume of sediment behind

82
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:21,060
the dam to do that we outfitted a canoe

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,170
with the hand made a symmetry device and

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,730
we put on waders and we use 1989 Maps to

85
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,140
do these calculations you see some of

86
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,140
these calculations later it's pretty

87
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,659
exciting we also wanted to adjust the

88
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,069
invasives on the site and so the state

89
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,510
was looking into getting funding for

90
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,819
this and we wanted to help so we put on

91
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,620
waders we grabbed the GPS we started

92
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,959
mapping where the Phragmites was and

93
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,699
where the maui was in doing this we

94
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,560
discovered that there was a large

95
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,610
diversity of that we didn't think would

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,819
be there because it looked like a

97
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,970
cattail Marsh we also wanted to address

98
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,670
environments on human health and so we

99
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,100
sampled for bacterial contaminants that

100
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,290
would be upstream and downstream of the

101
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,540
dam to see there any differences among

102
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,180
the results would be we also looked at

103
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,420
heavy metals and soils and methane in

104
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,949
the sediment and at the end of the day

105
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,840
we really wanted to recognize the

106
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,599
ecosystem services and the functions

107
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,250
that the site is currently providing and

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,530
we want to provide realistic options

109
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,420
that will help these functions continue

110
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,369
and so with help from community

111
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,100
management's some of which are cute

112
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,389
today

113
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,120
does a lot of great work we're excited

114
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,099
to present

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,509
so with that in mind thank you all for

116
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:41,500
coming because I'll hand it over to make

117
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:44,978
for the presentation that way all right

118
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,199
um thank you all for coming exciting

119
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:49,509
stuff this is our entire semester so a

120
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,660
lot of work in time would've went into

121
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,129
this for sure these are all the general

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,449
things were going to be going over today

123
00:05:54,129 --> 00:06:01,509
in greater detail than Audrey mentioned

124
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:05,500
as Audrey mentioned the lake is was

125
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:09,819
built or the lake was built in 1930 by a

126
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,949
dam by the CCC for many years and

127
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:15,250
existed as a lake and it was important

128
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,680
to the beauty of the area and the beauty

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,779
of the recreation facility also

130
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,439
important to keeping sediment out of the

131
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:26,888
swimming pool downstream but over time

132
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:30,310
it filled up with sediment 16 acres

133
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,860
worth about and as it is now it looks

134
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,038
nothing like what it used to this is a

135
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,038
historical map

136
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:49,240
it used to be a stream and it was turned

137
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:51,728
into a lake by the dam within a BU some

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,788
years it is now wetland and what we want

139
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:57,459
to know is is the wetland really that

140
00:06:54,788 --> 00:07:00,009
bad or does it provide similar ecosystem

141
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,378
services as a lake and the show changed

142
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,590
roberta factor lake or kept as a wetland

143
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:08,370
okay so some site characteristics these

144
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:11,649
are the positive aspects of the marsh

145
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,060
not all negative aspects it prevents

146
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:16,689
sediment from flowing into the swimming

147
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:20,978
area and with that sediment also fecal

148
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:22,990
coliforms it provides an ecosystem for a

149
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:27,189
variety of urban species and animal

150
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,439
species and it provides a different

151
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,598
aesthetic than the lake you saw the

152
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,209
video it is quite beautiful

153
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,449
but what we want to know is if it's

154
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:39,519
worthwhile in camping

155
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:44,590
I'll hand it off to Tommy who is on the

156
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:49,948
mapping team I prefer not to use the mic

157
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:52,929
can everyone hear me if I don't so

158
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,180
general overview is that Lake treatment

159
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,908
doesn't exist in limbo there's a pretty

160
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,129
large watershed contributing float to it

161
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:03,490
the lake hair is represented by that

162
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:06,519
tiny set of black points in the in the

163
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,819
top left corner and the watershed itself

164
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,490
is very large so this is a map of a

165
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:15,069
digital elevation model some very

166
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,158
amazing people have allowed us to have a

167
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:21,460
1 meter resolution medium which is what

168
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,668
we used along with curb number

169
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:27,818
calculations to delineate the watershed

170
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:31,209
so this is the EEM displaying elevation

171
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:34,839
and then this is a layer representing

172
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:37,088
curve numbers so high curve numbers mean

173
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,980
that there's low permeability in that

174
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,710
soil and vice versa

175
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,769
perv numbers and this is a function of

176
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:48,070
both soil type and land-use type so this

177
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,470
was used in conjunction with the EEM to

178
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,330
delineate the watershed this gives us a

179
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,310
little bit more information about what

180
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,370
kind of runoff lake treatment is

181
00:08:54,309 --> 00:09:00,099
receiving so in yellow is agricultural

182
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,840
land use and that kind of represents the

183
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,580
hot spots where we might expect

184
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,110
problematic or enough to be contributing

185
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:12,700
to the lake using the hydrological

186
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,190
models from the EEM and storm runoff we

187
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,250
could model the general flow of streams

188
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,370
in the area and if you zoom in further

189
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,379
this coincided pretty accurately with

190
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,820
the path of water up until we get to

191
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,570
Lake treatment where there has been a

192
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,110
slight divergence as we would expect so

193
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:36,070
using all of that data and NRCC storm

194
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:39,970
information we calculated runoff for a

195
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,129
24 hour storm for various frequencies so

196
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,350
this is an example of a frequency

197
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:46,720
duration curve for a one year storm a

198
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,920
storm of intensity that we can expect to

199
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,080
see once every year we did this for

200
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,000
various frequencies up to a storm that

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,889
you would expect to see once every 500

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
years and these are the corresponding

203
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,710
runoffs

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,019
runoff rates that we would expect to see

205
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,960
at the dam point

206
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,590
it's a commonly accepted practice to

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,900
model climate change in the year 2050 by

208
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:14,019
multiplying existing precipitation rates

209
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:16,059
by a factor of 1.5 so these are the

210
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,169
flows that we can expect to see 50 years

211
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:21,500
from now or less than 50 years

212
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:23,208
20 seconds and then I'll hand it over to

213
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,870
Kevin he talked about comparison with

214
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:28,699
historic maps yeah so in this 1938

215
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,820
picture you can see the lake perfectly

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,220
has a lake and it's no Marsh included

217
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,350
but as time progresses you begin to see

218
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,970
the encroachment of in March of the

219
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,459
marsh which currently stands at ten

220
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:44,420
point eight nine acres of the original

221
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:48,888
about 13 to 16 acre footprint of Lake

222
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:51,349
treatment original treatment so then

223
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:54,230
using those maps which Susan Hoskins

224
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,600
directed us to we could see we could

225
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,909
look more closely at how the extent of

226
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,100
the lake has changed so this is a more

227
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:03,110
modern representation which is still

228
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,409
slightly bigger than the current extent

229
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,419
this is from the 1950s you can see that

230
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:10,730
the lake displayed is significantly

231
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:13,039
larger with emerging wetland and the

232
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,600
South depicted by those dots I don't

233
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,539
know if you can see them currently but

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,100
they're emerging and then this is from

235
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:24,078
1898 before the dam was constructed

236
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,820
we're not completely sure about how

237
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,069
accurate this is because of the

238
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,440
equipment that they had in the 1800s but

239
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,709
is the best estimate that we have and

240
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,180
you can see here that the lake falls in

241
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:40,698
this area and the elevation ranges from

242
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:43,189
940 feet to 920 and we use that

243
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:46,250
information to determine the slope while

244
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,670
modeling the historic elevation of the

245
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:54,799
stream so this is just a side-by-side

246
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:57,019
comparison and so our de M shows us the

247
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,849
elevation of the surface of water but

248
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:01,870
doesn't tell us what the elevation of

249
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,850
the underlying sediment is like so

250
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,948
Dustin and Jonas and I went out in a

251
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,680
canoe with of the chemistry device and

252
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:11,448
got all these data points representing

253
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,139
the depth of water at different points

254
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:14,568
in the lake

255
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,620
and we could interpolate those to come

256
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:19,319
up with the general surface of

257
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,210
underwater so we could subtract the

258
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,180
volume of water from the current lake

259
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,040
but then we also have to model the

260
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,169
historic stream because surprisingly

261
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,919
there were no de M s in the eighteen

262
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:33,659
hundred's so we did that I can talk more

263
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,639
about the methodology because it was

264
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,199
slightly involved but we basically just

265
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,539
raised everything to the highest

266
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,110
elevation sloped it and then dug out the

267
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,860
channel

268
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,990
well it's sorry a de M is a digital

269
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,789
elevation model so it's basically just

270
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:52,440
topo lines at a very high resolution so

271
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:55,319
then these are our estimates for the

272
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,140
current volume of water in the lake acre

273
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,129
feet it might be an easier measure to

274
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:05,069
think about the meter cubed so if you if

275
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,559
you part of a 63 acre area it would be

276
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,780
raised to like one foot in depth and an

277
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,750
acre is approximately one football field

278
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:15,269
in size so the annual deposition is

279
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,850
pretty high and we could expect the

280
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,889
sediment to fill up the lake in about

281
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,340
thirty years if current conditions

282
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:25,319
remain the same to reduce deposition

283
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,840
rate there are certain hotspots of

284
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,990
erosion upstream of the lake that we

285
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,570
could address we could also construct a

286
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,149
channel adjacent to the wetland to allow

287
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,590
the water to have a higher velocity

288
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:41,279
meaning that it would be depositing less

289
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:45,570
self and Kevin has identified areas of

290
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,089
erosion hotspots yeah based on the vote

291
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,120
of coefficients and the land use we can

292
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,780
see certain areas where agricultural

293
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,029
land and a bear era cultural and

294
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,370
contributes mostly or we we believe that

295
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,699
contributes mostly to the deposition of

296
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,500
sediment and so as these critical areas

297
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,770
upstream of the dam that we believe in

298
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:12,559
the state or somebody should really look

299
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:16,490
into into more depth about controlling

300
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,229
imitation so as a step to maybe

301
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,940
he long gate the amount of time we have

302
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,590
until he needs to be dredged or some

303
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,020
other measure to control for the

304
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:29,000
deposition of sediment so then stream

305
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:31,879
Bank analysis was conducted at various

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,860
sites upstream of the lake to determine

307
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,570
what the channel looks like without

308
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,060
human influence or without too much

309
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,480
human influence so we did this manually

310
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:43,489
with levels and meter sticks and we

311
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,920
found a general trapezoidal cross

312
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:50,600
sectional shape to the channel upstream

313
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:55,159
of the area and this is just two more

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,740
from other sites so based on the cross

315
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,199
sectional area and the slope of the of

316
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,330
the stream we determined that using the

317
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,250
Roskam classification for streams which

318
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,490
is kind of like both hydrological and

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,399
ecological it falls between c and b so

320
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,720
kind of an intermediate slope liable to

321
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,819
changes in meander shape the service is

322
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,399
provided by the current system with the

323
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,470
wetland as it is are that it's

324
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,620
potentially treating agricultural runoff

325
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,810
so we do have some water samples that we

326
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,519
tested but extensive water sampling

327
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,279
could give us a better idea of what this

328
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,470
is it serves as a flood control system

329
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,620
currently because it is essentially a

330
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,170
retention basin it allows us to control

331
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,570
flow downstream with the boards as the

332
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:45,229
park currently does and it provides a

333
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,180
unique wetland habitat the hydrological

334
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,550
risks are that there's rapid deposition

335
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,309
happening which leads to a reduction in

336
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,799
basin capacity so if we get used to it

337
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:56,659
serving as a flood retention Basin that

338
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,139
might change in time if we don't control

339
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:02,049
for erosion additionally it will mean

340
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:04,088
that the one who gets flooded

341
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:07,958
speak with me and that can be a habitat

342
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:10,209
change so our recommendations are two

343
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,159
codes to perhaps construct a channel

344
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,889
adjacent to the wetland from the

345
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,719
hydrological perspective a trapezoidal

346
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:20,639
cross section is what we recommend based

347
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,620
on upstream characteristics and to avoid

348
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,449
erosion of we have more detailed

349
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:30,519
measurements about what the site slope

350
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:32,290
ratio should be to avoid erosion we

351
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,419
recommend that the bed be lined with

352
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:37,120
cobbles and shingles so basically

353
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:39,129
layered rocks as you would naturally see

354
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,278
in such a stream because they have a

355
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:44,470
very high roughness coefficient Europe

356
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:47,139
expressed as Manning's and meaning that

357
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,410
they're more resistant to erosion but

358
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:52,419
even then for a channel to carry the

359
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,610
discharge from a two-year storm without

360
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,129
any erosion it would have to be very

361
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,379
dirty big the reason for that is because

362
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,049
erosion naturally occurs during such

363
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:04,539
storms I'm sure no one has seen a stream

364
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:07,899
during a very heavy storm not have some

365
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:10,359
amount of sediment suspended in it so

366
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,300
there are two ways to perhaps combat

367
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,869
that one is through wetland stream

368
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,639
complex where we direct flow from the

369
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,828
wetland into the channel through a

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,660
permeable embankment so we would

371
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:25,058
essentially have a weapon on one side

372
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,519
under channel adjacent to it and they're

373
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:29,049
sharing flow underneath the surface if

374
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,019
we make this embankment out of a

375
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,970
permeable material and that also

376
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:37,539
provides two different habitats it

377
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,440
allows for more riparian habitat on one

378
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:41,920
side and

379
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,990
and mosaic on the other side I'll now

380
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,990
hand it over to the methane team

381
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,890
hi everybody so as we've already talked

382
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,580
about a bunch there's a lot of sediment

383
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:10,940
that has accumulated behind the dam and

384
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:12,829
that has because of the texture of that

385
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,519
sediment and the amount of water behind

386
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:21,409
it has led to methanogens producing a

387
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:24,470
lot of methane it's a very anoxic

388
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,600
environment underneath the dam and that

389
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,579
means that well greenhouse gases would

390
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,459
normally be produced methane is produced

391
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:34,210
in this case instead of co2 and methane

392
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:39,200
is a much more powerful greenhouse gas

393
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:41,329
and the water in the reservoir that the

394
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,090
dam has created also acts as a barrier

395
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:47,389
not allowing the methane that is created

396
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:49,579
through the sediment and the microbes in

397
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,320
the sediment to be released

398
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:54,529
it keeps the bubbles down from the

399
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:57,500
pressure this is important to our

400
00:18:54,529 --> 00:19:00,440
recommendations for the site because it

401
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,130
depends on whether the stakeholders

402
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,640
involved care about this as a potential

403
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,920
source of greenhouse gases if there's a

404
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,980
lot of methane that could be released it

405
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,808
would probably not be wise to allow the

406
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,210
water to drain out

407
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:21,628
so we wanted to test how much methane

408
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,239
was being produced in the wetland these

409
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:28,858
are those sites that we dredge from used

410
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:31,319
an excellent wrench and we threw out

411
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:33,989
around the dam I just wanted to point

412
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,908
out that these areas we think have more

413
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:38,329
running water and these areas have more

414
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:41,849
stagnant water or what to interpretation

415
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:43,949
so from each sample we took 20 grams and

416
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,658
put them into airtight mason jars that

417
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,088
we pumped out to oxygen and pumped in

418
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:49,619
nitrogen to create an anoxic environment

419
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:52,138
for nothing to be produced

420
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:54,269
we incubated it for a week and then used

421
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:57,118
gas chromatography to measure how much

422
00:19:54,269 --> 00:20:00,899
methane was in the mason jars and after

423
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:03,178
that one week then we enriched the

424
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:06,118
samples with 2 grams of dry cattails

425
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:09,389
each to add some more carbon from Adana

426
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:11,218
chains we again took out the oxygen

427
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:13,648
replace it with nitrogen incubated it

428
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:19,139
for one week and then tested how much

429
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:21,329
methane was produced in that I'm just

430
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:23,189
going to use this one so I'll run

431
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,989
through some of the results real quick

432
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,659
so we have to roll samples here and then

433
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,159
we have as jasmine was talking about the

434
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,249
Umbridge samples where we had two grams

435
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,839
of cattails just to make a bit more

436
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,909
clear we have here so this is the

437
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:37,128
methane produced in each of the sampling

438
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,899
sheets out here and we have an average

439
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:41,878
so as we expected we see a higher

440
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:44,488
methane reduction in new group enriched

441
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:46,019
samples because we added a substrate

442
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,509
there so that was kind of what we

443
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,098
expected and as jasmine was saying as

444
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,989
well sample three and four where we

445
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:56,700
expect more running water running fruit

446
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:58,619
we wouldn't expect like high methane

447
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,210
production there was these two samples

448
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:01,918
here because we expected all the water

449
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,588
to come through here so a low

450
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,919
segmentation there or where we have one

451
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:09,269
two and five when we assisted well we

452
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,460
expect this to be more sediment

453
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:16,319
depositing here so what we wanted to do

454
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,879
was to calculate the methane produced by

455
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:22,319
the lake and the wetland area so we

456
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:26,128
found some numbers for the sediment

457
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,749
density and we made the assumption that

458
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:30,538
methane is already produced in the tops

459
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:31,798
and 10 centimeters of the lake because

460
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:35,729
below that we don't really have any

461
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:38,538
carbon source by the help of Joey yard

462
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:43,109
of the Department of Natural Resources

463
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:46,679
we calculated this and we got a methane

464
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:47,699
production per year to be 14 to 27

465
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,820
kilograms

466
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:55,139
yeah to put this in perspective we knew

467
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:58,499
that this guy and a cow can produce

468
00:21:55,138 --> 00:22:00,808
around 58 to 144 kilograms of methane in

469
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:02,819
you so that means that one cow produced

470
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:07,558
two to ten times as much methane a year

471
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:09,569
and the lakes last wetlands again

472
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,329
consulting with Joey Abbott we looked at

473
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,668
the global wetland emission of methane

474
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:17,878
and these numbers are actually pretty

475
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:20,970
low when you look at the like a standard

476
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:26,638
or the average wetland methane

477
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:29,940
production so our recommendation would

478
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:31,949
definitely or we the methane production

479
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,619
in the wetlands lastly wouldn't be it

480
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,159
that big of a concern it's always a

481
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:40,638
concern of course but not as much yes as

482
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,639
it could be

483
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,430
I'll hand it over to benthic group

484
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:58,319
hi guys so we went out on September 30th

485
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,799
and we just went to collect back the

486
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,529
convert boots we did take up streams

487
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,960
inside we did eight downstream sites and

488
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:10,440
three sites in the lake but we are only

489
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,620
able to get member grids from one of

490
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,210
those legs in the lake which was

491
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,559
interesting to say the least and that's

492
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:23,220
some some of us kicking into the nets

493
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,799
we went out again on October 13 just

494
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,519
because we wanted more so maybe one more

495
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,759
sampling from ops upstream so we went to

496
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,460
four more sites off of comfort mode and

497
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,410
then we did some staining with Jeremy

498
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,860
who's in the conduit map it was very

499
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:43,470
helpful so this is just more of us in

500
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:48,859
the field it was an interesting time I

501
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:53,100
learned a lot about Indians so we

502
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:57,419
collected 199 invertebrate species were

503
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:59,759
identified by family 16 families of

504
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:03,180
invertebrates were identified and these

505
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:07,769
are four drawings of what what they were

506
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:10,110
so yeah the template turbulently peptide

507
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:18,660
you made it and then we did four species

508
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:20,429
of fish so we wanted to we wanted to

509
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,150
like make sense of what all this means

510
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,420
so he did that

511
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:29,820
HDMI and Andrea miser is essentially the

512
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,160
Anna vertebrates ability to withstand

513
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:35,849
like pollution so like you lower your

514
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,060
age BMI the less the less resistant you

515
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:41,429
are like potion so you kind of want your

516
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,740
your numbers to be about as close to

517
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,650
zero as possible because that kind of is

518
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,329
indicative that your stream is pretty

519
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:52,200
not as pollutant so yes or even that

520
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:55,678
calculation

521
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,340
and so we divided it in terms of

522
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,249
upstream pool downstream pool you know

523
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:05,339
upstream fo now some FL and our entire

524
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:07,739
side is about a four so it's moderately

525
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:11,849
polluted I don't think it's too much to

526
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:13,950
be worried about one thing that that was

527
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:18,569
interesting was absolutely obstacles

528
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,700
ammonia money 2.2 - and we didn't get

529
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:22,858
enough data to see if that significant

530
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,859
some more testing should be done to see

531
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:29,808
like what happened if that's actually

532
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:33,329
something that's less polluted I guess

533
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:35,460
and so then we had like we collected all

534
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:37,378
this invertebrates and we can put it on

535
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,200
a PI track but we wanted to figure out a

536
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:42,569
way to what does this mean how can we

537
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,239
compare these two like okay like D

538
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:46,769
wonderful has all these species and we

539
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:49,528
don't need and do you want oh we only

540
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:52,169
had like this one species of

541
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:56,099
invertebrates like how can we compare

542
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,009
these two so we decided to do diversity

543
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:01,678
indices and one of them was the Simpsons

544
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:04,470
index so you looked at dancing pool

545
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,590
dancing alone and the entire dam stood

546
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,919
system and upstream system and our

547
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:13,829
conclusions were downstream pools were

548
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,850
more diverse than the Falls and dance

549
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:20,999
and so and downstream in general was

550
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:23,158
more diverse than upstream and then we

551
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:27,149
did another diversity index called

552
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:30,690
Shannon Boehner and so essentially be

553
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:33,209
looking at H and this one kind of said

554
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,389
the opposite thing it said downstream

555
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,788
baffles are more more diverse than cool

556
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:43,019
than upstream is more diverse than

557
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:44,970
downstream and I think I respect that

558
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:48,358
it's probably because of how they're

559
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,380
calculated if you know it's in the

560
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,869
denominator first

561
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,870
that's it kind of doesn't give us much a

562
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:57,119
way to if you found one species that

563
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:59,099
would be one one minus one which would

564
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,979
make the denominator Oh sir I think I

565
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,959
suspect that that's probably why aren't

566
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:10,009
you indices don't agree on that friend

567
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,009
and then I turned it over to thanks for

568
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,590
all right so I reviewed some research

569
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,230
that might be important to consider for

570
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:24,389
like training so the paper that I

571
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,610
reviewed was amended community theory

572
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,440
includes restoration by Christopher Swan

573
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:33,209
and Brian L brown medic community theory

574
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,029
considers local and regional effects and

575
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,000
how varying the agreement of isolation

576
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:42,269
along our network such as a river can

577
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,569
change these effects so Swan and Brown

578
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:48,559
used the metal community theory in their

579
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:54,659
studying of or stored and unrestored

580
00:27:48,559 --> 00:28:00,029
streams to determine how the determining

581
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:03,660
how local and regional effects can

582
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:07,160
affect the success of restoration so in

583
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:09,570
order to determine the isolation of

584
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,570
particular points along a river network

585
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:16,230
they use this trailer stream order

586
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:19,049
method of classification so this is a

587
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,170
just a little picture depicting the

588
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:25,079
basics of Strahler stream order

589
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:27,060
classification so you can see that a

590
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,619
first-order stream to first story

591
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:31,109
streams come together to form a

592
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,519
second-order stream and that's the two

593
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:35,669
second-order streams come together to

594
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,259
form a third okra string I said a

595
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,840
first-order stream cannot come together

596
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,640
with

597
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,579
during the May 3rd overstream there must

598
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,650
be two secondary streams to become a

599
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:53,139
third over stream so Swan Brown found

600
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:55,390
that in first first and second order

601
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,610
streams were classified as isolated

602
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,580
headwaters and third and fourth order

603
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:05,428
streams work classified as main stem

604
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:09,658
wires so Swan and Brown found that in

605
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:12,100
these well-connected main stem reaches

606
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:15,159
regional effects were more likely to

607
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,199
play a role in biodiversity of benthic

608
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,159
invertebrates

609
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,019
whereas in isolated headwaters local

610
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,820
effects were more likely to play a role

611
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:31,808
in the vibe of this video Annika

612
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:35,589
Bergeron so so what does this mean for

613
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:38,319
Lake Tremont Lake treeman or the stream

614
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:41,349
that became lake Sherman was determined

615
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,139
to be a third order stream so what this

616
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:46,480
indicates is is that regional effects

617
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,179
can potentially play a larger role in

618
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,899
determining the biodiversity of our site

619
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:56,519
and local effects so the dam at Lake

620
00:29:52,898 --> 00:30:00,819
treeman could potentially be impeding

621
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:03,908
species dispersal at our site so if we

622
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:07,629
potentially removed it in the damn it

623
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:12,789
could potentially increase the

624
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:14,770
biodiversity of our site and one final

625
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:17,740
thing that's one Brown in an effort to

626
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:21,460
bring out in this study is that sites

627
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,819
like Wade Tremont should and could be

628
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,620
could and should be researched to

629
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:30,720
further restoration ecology

630
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:36,479
understanding of how local and

631
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,279
sex effect restoration and how we can

632
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,038
better restore the sites like lake

633
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:49,349
treatment and now we'll move on to Ryan

634
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:52,650
and the bacterial contamination ops so

635
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:53,849
relating to the ethnic diversity and

636
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,019
overall human health we want to

637
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:57,359
investigate in certain types of

638
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,819
contamination such as eco contamination

639
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,629
don't you do that we collected six

640
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:05,428
samples along along the water jet like

641
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,770
this example on the watershed jiancheng

642
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:10,559
upstream to downstream then we took them

643
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:12,869
back to the lab and we do desperate for

644
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,950
the contamination we we use this

645
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:16,199
quantity tray system which is

646
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,960
essentially trays for each sample you

647
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,460
fill it with other metal of water sample

648
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,120
at least with reagent and incubated for

649
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,798
24 hours and then if it worked at the

650
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,509
e.coli or any other coliform bacteria

651
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,179
we're looking for is present it will

652
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:32,369
interact with the reagent and then it we

653
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:37,500
should go over a blacklight so that's

654
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:41,069
the example so these are some pictures

655
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,109
on our collection various sites and this

656
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:44,879
is all of the samples lined up and as

657
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,798
you can see there's a gradient of

658
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,960
contamination so if we want at the end

659
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,579
of the glow these are depositing at the

660
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,740
sediment deposits deposits the

661
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,689
contamination and this is a concern

662
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,970
because as you can see the swimming

663
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,980
areas or this hume interaction with the

664
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,450
water is very effeminate it's

665
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:06,589
effectively possible concern for human

666
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:08,850
health and then just as a conclusion

667
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:10,798
this is sort this is sort of hinting out

668
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:12,389
hinting that there needs to be more

669
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,579
research done just words and

670
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,929
contamination is coming from and if it's

671
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,058
like a human source or if it's from

672
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,840
livestock we really need to like locate

673
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:21,750
in

674
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,059
these contamination points to prevent it

675
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,579
in the future to protect human health

676
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:29,000
and just the overall health of our

677
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,000
system

678
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:39,249
so during my project we also did

679
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:41,168
vegetation analysis and we have three

680
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:44,200
main objectives we wanted to identify

681
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:46,419
the diversity with within and around the

682
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,669
marsh we wanted to identify the main

683
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:51,219
cover types within the marsh and we also

684
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:52,869
wanted to identify where the invasive

685
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:57,489
species are because I know that's a big

686
00:32:52,868 --> 00:33:00,308
priority for the state parks Burgers so

687
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:03,308
the way we did this is we had 21 sites

688
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:06,368
that we did a drone flyover as you saw

689
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:08,278
at the beginning of the video and at

690
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:11,079
each of these sites we collected

691
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:15,669
representative samples of soil and

692
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:19,028
vegetation and these are just a couple

693
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:22,839
photos of us in the field doing these

694
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:25,269
field sites after we collected all these

695
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:28,118
samples we went up to the Bayley aureum

696
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:29,950
and worked with Ana Stelter who very

697
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:34,628
kindly helped us identify all of our

698
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:37,509
samples we also did nested quadrats

699
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:40,058
downstream of the marsh and this showed

700
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:44,679
us that there's about 33 species in a

701
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:47,888
six meter squared radius which defines

702
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:52,149
the understory in this forest below the

703
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:54,878
marsh we also do variable tree radius

704
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:57,158
plots and we found a total of eleven

705
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:58,598
tree species this sounds pretty low but

706
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,609
it makes sense because they're woody

707
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:04,178
species as opposed to herbaceous species

708
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:06,338
as we did in the nested quadrats so from

709
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:08,829
this we calculated the percent dominance

710
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:15,190
for each species and the trees per acre

711
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:16,750
for each species so our parks cares

712
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,318
about the most is probably invasive

713
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,119
species so we identified all the

714
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:24,519
different regions where invasive species

715
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,588
were found in the marsh and we have

716
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,219
Japanese knotweed we have reed

717
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:29,528
canarygrass

718
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,298
and we know Craig my tease I'd like to

719
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:33,849
point out that Phragmites is pretty

720
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:35,918
centralized in a localized region but

721
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:37,399
the reed canarygrass and Japanese

722
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:42,348
knotweed are spreading through

723
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:44,989
the marsh which might be a big issue so

724
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,568
these are the three invasive species

725
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,148
were focusing on fallopian japonica

726
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:51,858
which is the Japanese knotweed

727
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:54,469
Phragmites Australis which is Phragmites

728
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:59,778
and then phalaris r-run de valència

729
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:02,179
which is great canary grass we also

730
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:04,068
looked at the diversity in and

731
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:06,409
throughout the marsh as well as

732
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,058
downstream and when you first look at

733
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:10,518
this mark surely it's just a bunch of

734
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:13,009
cattails what's going on in there but in

735
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:16,149
reality we found 66 different generals

736
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:18,920
of different plant species in there and

737
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,170
it actually equated out to about 90

738
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,849
species and we still had some unknown so

739
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,180
it's probably closer to a hundred

740
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:28,460
species downstream and our nested

741
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:30,768
quadrats we have 33 species as I

742
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,490
previously mentioned and 11 species in

743
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:36,199
the variable tree radius clause and I

744
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,939
also would like to point out that as

745
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,730
you're going from the inlet of the

746
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,470
wetland down towards the dam diversity

747
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,230
is decreasing as you're going down on

748
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:51,169
which you know you might impact the

749
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:53,389
vegetative impact on this field site we

750
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:58,849
also realized that some trees are

751
00:35:53,389 --> 00:36:02,389
starting to to assist in in succession

752
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:05,660
of this Marsh so the tree species that

753
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:07,818
we found are platanus occidentalis which

754
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:12,440
this american second one and eastern

755
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:15,949
agudo which is boxelder so most of this

756
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,568
trees we found of a Serna Gunda were

757
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:19,578
just little seedlings but there were a

758
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:21,349
couple mature trees so we took a corn

759
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,710
from one of the mature trees and it aged

760
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:27,230
out about 20 years so this just

761
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,480
demonstrates that succession is not an

762
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,278
immediate process it's not going to fix

763
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,539
our problems as quickly as we would hope

764
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:34,360
so

765
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:36,730
we might suggest planting some

766
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,940
species to try and help stabilize the

767
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,409
banks with the roots or also shade out

768
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,300
some of the invasives that I previously

769
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:49,149
mentioned now this is where it starts

770
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,970
getting interesting when we first

771
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,610
visited our field site we saw this big

772
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:56,709
empty field of where there used to be

773
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,200
Japanese knotweed and we found out

774
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:02,519
viewers actually had created a knotweed

775
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,469
dam using all this stuff and fit down

776
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,769
you know that sounds pretty crazy but it

777
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:10,269
gets crazier this knotweed that these

778
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,909
beavers are cutting down are actually

779
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:16,210
water routing and the beavers are acting

780
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:18,549
as a vector so this is them actively

781
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,860
spreading and invasive species which

782
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,810
might have a larger impact not only on

783
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,940
our site but also throughout the county

784
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:27,429
so the state might want to look into

785
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:32,380
this a bit more because it's obviously a

786
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:33,879
big problem we also when we were going

787
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,940
through all our drone photos we found

788
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,990
this interesting thing happening we

789
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,050
found some Carrick's

790
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:43,509
which is such just in the middle of all

791
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,610
these cattails and it's kind of

792
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,970
interesting we're thinking this might be

793
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:52,030
a native sedge so it would be good if

794
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,589
you plan on replanting in this marsh to

795
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,170
use this because it's obviously I'm

796
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:59,500
competing type ovitch it's a large

797
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:01,180
dominant in this field site and it's

798
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,210
also low growing so it's not going to be

799
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:07,989
taking over too many other habitats for

800
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:10,650
other species when we were doing our

801
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:13,599
variable tree radius plots we found a

802
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:16,000
ground cedar which is a club moss and

803
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,460
it's actually a state protected plant in

804
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,789
New York State so if the state needs

805
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,949
some interesting aspect to you know

806
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,170
really sell to whoever they're working

807
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:29,319
for like this is an important site we

808
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:33,730
need to focus on this is one aspect you

809
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,200
can go at so in conclusion we just want

810
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,420
to recommend a couple things from the

811
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,399
vegetation aspect the state my

812
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,010
want to do more fall and spring sampling

813
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,960
of vegetation we were very limited for

814
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,430
this because we only had this fall

815
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,260
semester to do this but there's many

816
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:50,179
spring ephemeral and public plants that

817
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,030
I'm sure we missed

818
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:55,279
we also suggest doing more upstream

819
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,750
nested quadrats and variable radius Lots

820
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,000
just to get a better understanding of

821
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,710
what's going on

822
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,039
definitely studying the impacts beavers

823
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:06,559
are having all these invasives possibly

824
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,989
getting more funding for the knotweed

825
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,700
and we believe it's coming from an

826
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:12,159
upstream store source but we're not

827
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:14,779
really sure

828
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,429
using Watkins Glen as a reference site

829
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,430
you'll go into more detail about that

830
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:21,318
very soon in this presentation and

831
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:23,509
possibly identifying some important

832
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:25,429
wildlife habitat we found some different

833
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,970
species like wood ducks and black birds

834
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:31,818
when we were doing our fieldwork so now

835
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:36,219
I'm going to turn it over to Karen and

836
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:36,219
Daniel for soil analysis

837
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:42,818
okay last but not least we're going to

838
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:44,768
talk about the soil analysis that we did

839
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:47,018
on this site and we are trying to answer

840
00:39:44,768 --> 00:39:48,848
two primary questions one being are

841
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,618
there any issues with the soil that can

842
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:53,170
limit the plantings and recommendations

843
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,999
we have and also if we were to remove

844
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,039
sediment from the lake is the dress

845
00:39:54,998 --> 00:40:01,509
material hazardous and if so what can we

846
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,039
do with it and answer these questions

847
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:04,690
we're looking at both surface soil

848
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,089
content around lick treatment and

849
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,230
upstream and the dredge material that

850
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:10,538
was mentioned earlier in this

851
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,849
presentation but surface soil we looked

852
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:14,559
at aggregate stability texture active

853
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:16,269
carbonate nutrients and with the dredge

854
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,599
material we're looking at heavy metals

855
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:21,278
and soluble salt and our additional

856
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,920
challenge was to do all these tests on a

857
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:25,568
small class budget but luckily the

858
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,338
Cornell Saarland Health lab was really

859
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:29,588
generous and allowed us to do a lot of

860
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:31,420
these tests ourselves for free and then

861
00:40:29,588 --> 00:40:36,699
be strategic about what tests we

862
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:38,499
submitted on to do we looked at 25

863
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:40,808
different heavy metals some of which are

864
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:43,568
shown in this chart with our five drug

865
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:45,369
samples and the list of heavy metals and

866
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:47,318
what we found is that the majority of

867
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:49,690
the heavy metals are pretty far below

868
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:52,119
the level of concern that New York State

869
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,778
has so that's good there were slightly

870
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,519
elevated levels of nickel and zinc you

871
00:40:55,778 --> 00:41:00,460
can see the yellow highlighted parts

872
00:40:57,518 --> 00:41:03,639
there with the truth or drug sample one

873
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,980
in two but both were within what we call

874
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,318
the raw background soil level that's

875
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:11,349
what you might naturally find in upstate

876
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,568
New York oils and they were also pretty

877
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:15,910
far below the level of concern for

878
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:18,400
Public Health and aquatic health so they

879
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:20,199
are things to keep an eye for and if you

880
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,170
do plan on dredging or removing sediment

881
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:26,469
we would recommend taking more samples

882
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,960
of sediment from the lake that could be

883
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:31,828
dredged core samples or water samples

884
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,119
just to verify that these numbers do

885
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,859
represent the heavy metal content in

886
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,309
light treatment and then also

887
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:39,769
acknowledging that if you

888
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:41,779
resentment and moving it elsewhere with

889
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:43,909
the place with high thing or nickel

890
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:48,860
levels and that could be a problem but

891
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:51,980
overall we decided that the sediment was

892
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,510
generally suitable for any uses and that

893
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:58,389
there's not any problems right now for

894
00:41:53,510 --> 00:42:00,620
public health or ecological health and

895
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:02,389
then here we just have a map of the

896
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:04,429
relative concentrations of nickel is

897
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,539
sampled in like treeman and we

898
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:08,239
especially want to show this because

899
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:09,590
this was pretty prevalent throughout all

900
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,869
of the heavy metals where you find the

901
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,120
highest concentration closer to the dam

902
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:16,130
further downstream kind of similar to

903
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,309
what the methane hume was talking about

904
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,660
earlier so that's probably where you

905
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:21,860
would be removing sediment but it's

906
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:23,779
important to acknowledge that this is

907
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,660
also where you might have a heavier

908
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,370
concentration of heavy metals because of

909
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:33,049
the finer soils and that's just where

910
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:34,639
sediment is accumulating when we're

911
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,590
drying out our samples we start to

912
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,029
notice these crazy salt formations so

913
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:41,269
we're like we're gonna look into soluble

914
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,220
salts but luckily all the samples are

915
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:45,559
pretty non saline are only very slightly

916
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:47,239
saline which means that the sediment

917
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,599
should be generally safe for any plans

918
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:53,239
for treatment or treat you want to add

919
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,769
and then moving on to the surface

920
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,409
toilets we want to look at aggregate

921
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:59,389
stability and so this is how well so

922
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,980
aggregates aggregates resist falling

923
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:03,619
apart when they're hit by heavy rains

924
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:06,079
and you measure it by sifting out

925
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:08,179
argit's of a certain size putting it on

926
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,309
a cyst and then putting it under this

927
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,980
crazy machine the Cornell sprinkle

928
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:15,199
infiltrometer which kind of simulates

929
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,240
when a standard or any policy for five

930
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,369
minutes and then all the stuff you have

931
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:21,229
left is your stable aggregates and use

932
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:25,789
that to calculate ear aggregate

933
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:28,369
stability and here we have a turn of our

934
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:30,949
results and I tried always used to score

935
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:31,309
those results and overall we found that

936
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,989
our

937
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,679
without creating medium to high IV

938
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:37,609
instability these might be slightly

939
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,429
overestimated because we had a heavy

940
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:41,960
sand content but in all this suggests

941
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:45,049
that there's a pretty strong resistance

942
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,789
to soil loss during rain events so this

943
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:51,620
is pretty good for the site good for

944
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:55,029
plantings and annual is going to talk

945
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:55,029
about the rest of our soil analysis

946
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:05,599
instead of behind behind there you go

947
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:07,940
great thank you so it's first texture

948
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,710
many of the soils on this site scored

949
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:15,889
similarly much of our sand content was

950
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:20,360
up here between 90% and 60% so a lot of

951
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:22,159
very well-drained soils heavy sand some

952
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,870
of this can have to do with some of our

953
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,460
sampling methodology if we went back and

954
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:28,250
had a chance to do this again we would

955
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,440
be taking much deeper samples to get at

956
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:36,349
not just what's left on top but some of

957
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,670
the smaller particulates underneath the

958
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:40,099
active carbon this is an interesting

959
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,900
measure so when you consider the

960
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:43,670
rhizosphere all of the bacteria that are

961
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,070
down in the roots of trying to help the

962
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:49,610
plants and trees establish they need

963
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:52,010
active carbon for functioning and this

964
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,590
test uses an interesting oxidative

965
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,390
reaction to determine how much carbon

966
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,800
not just rate carbon there but how much

967
00:44:56,389 --> 00:45:02,690
is actually going to be available for

968
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:05,150
reacting we found that intuitively given

969
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,710
the heavy sand content there wasn't a

970
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,320
whole lot of active carbon in these

971
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:15,170
samples the sites that showed the

972
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:17,660
highest concentrations 7 8 11 18 these

973
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,340
areas that either had standing water or

974
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:20,629
areas that were prone to deposition

975
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,740
during

976
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:25,500
additionally there's a gradient as one

977
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:27,209
moves through the wetland if we have

978
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,250
been oriented here there's the the inlet

979
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,720
over here on the left and the dam

980
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,760
reservoir down here in the bottom so

981
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,619
again that's that's flow slows down

982
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,290
you're going to find a particle

983
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:40,889
deposition and that would help

984
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:44,639
facilitate increased active carbon again

985
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:46,739
soil health lab at Cornell excellent

986
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,889
total framing the home garden to 1060

987
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:51,929
soil nutrient analysis generally it's is

988
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,609
going to be used for agriculture problem

989
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:55,230
solving do you have an individual

990
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,380
mineral or element that your soils

991
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:00,630
lacking in so we use this to try and

992
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,210
figure out like is there anything on

993
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,059
site that is going to derail future

994
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:08,849
plant events or are there pH concerns

995
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:10,829
that might help us do we shift towards

996
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,059
an air cassius replanting skiing or

997
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:16,429
something a little bit more alkaline

998
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:18,809
living as far as the nutrient analysis

999
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:20,549
really not a whole lot to say nothing is

1000
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:23,730
too high nothing is too low the soil

1001
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:31,260
will be really facilitate new plant

1002
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:32,699
establishment looking at pH so generally

1003
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,010
pH is going to have this step like a

1004
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:36,389
round seven moving neutral the soils

1005
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,250
that we have on site are just above

1006
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:40,349
seven so we're going to be in that

1007
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,420
slightly alkaline range so we're not

1008
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:44,239
going to be planting ericaceous things

1009
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,950
that moral is that kind of stuff but

1010
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,989
generally there shouldn't be a big issue

1011
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:52,769
with species selection from a pH

1012
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:53,849
perspective additionally we have the

1013
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,900
organic matter

1014
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:58,710
again intuitively hi Sam content

1015
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,619
well-drained soil there's giving me a

1016
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,980
low organic matter a lot of soils range

1017
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:07,349
from one to six percent usually one

1018
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,139
won't see these below one percentages

1019
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,940
and set for a desert soils so that's

1020
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:15,480
sort of what's being created there is an

1021
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,550
interesting little microbiome where the

1022
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,150
sand or all the organic matter washes

1023
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:23,700
off and

1024
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:27,630
sois here we can see it again these

1025
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:29,368
areas that have well seven eight eleven

1026
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:34,500
this is a beaver dam area there's also a

1027
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:38,818
flood deposition in that spot so fairly

1028
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,679
high om there and then framing it all

1029
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:43,108
together what we tested of the dredge

1030
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,379
samples didn't throw back a lot of red

1031
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:48,119
flecks however using a neck wound wrench

1032
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,278
which is a quad that goes down and

1033
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,890
samples the top couple centimeters of

1034
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:55,048
soil that lets us know recently what has

1035
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:57,838
happened now what happened in the 60s or

1036
00:47:55,048 --> 00:48:00,179
the 50s during any kind of development

1037
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,858
in the area we don't know so one of the

1038
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,699
ways to get at that would be to do cores

1039
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:08,699
and test various layers of those course

1040
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:09,778
beyond that there are almost no concerns

1041
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:12,568
when it comes to plant establishment

1042
00:48:09,778 --> 00:48:14,358
many things should do well on this site

1043
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:17,278
there will be a break-even of course of

1044
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,598
closer to the water rank sandier soils

1045
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:21,449
you're gonna have things that establish

1046
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,960
more easily but it really shouldn't be a

1047
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:28,818
problem for the site this is a great

1048
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,429
resource it can be available digitally

1049
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:34,588
we used the entire way through doing our

1050
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:37,500
event not standard operating procedures

1051
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:39,509
through our interpretation of data so

1052
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,460
whether at work or at home is unique to

1053
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:46,020
you so I was like that's the best this

1054
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,920
resource I'm Ann Arbor stood botanic

1055
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:48,869
garden and this is likely a

1056
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,579
self-indulgence is if I don't talk about

1057
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:53,119
trees for one presentation I've probably

1058
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,119
done something

1059
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:58,880
as far as replanting there could be a

1060
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,289
lot of things accomplished by that some

1061
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,869
of it could be stream bank stabilization

1062
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:05,179
like we're seeing these will is down on

1063
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:07,400
the bottom right it could also be

1064
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:09,289
invasive competition strategies a lot of

1065
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,970
the invasives on site probably a full

1066
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:15,110
Sun and organisms if you can establish

1067
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:17,919
some kind of successional solar barrier

1068
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,420
above them and that might be a

1069
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,950
mechanical free chemical for a method

1070
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,559
for treating it but over a very long

1071
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:26,899
term to that end some of the species on

1072
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,460
site that are already doing that you can

1073
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,660
see here this isn't like treatment but

1074
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:34,119
it's what it could look like with a

1075
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:36,079
bunch of red stem dogwood a lot willows

1076
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,849
establishing on the banks they're doing

1077
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,579
great willows and poplars especially

1078
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,839
right in those sites and then largest

1079
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:47,000
trees on the site right now are the

1080
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,100
American settlers for some species

1081
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,809
diversity I'm a big fan of deciduous

1082
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:55,339
conifers taxodium the bald cypress is

1083
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:58,849
very common in these kind of habitats

1084
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:02,769
and they will out-compete many other

1085
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:06,619
woody species given the section strings

1086
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:08,780
if you want to get fun I really like to

1087
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:10,699
Mexico it was one of the most common

1088
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,780
wetland tree species on the North

1089
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:13,429
American continent

1090
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:20,480
I've been till about two and a half

1091
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:22,219
million years ago they do ma petites the

1092
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,769
kind of site here we can see this is a

1093
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:26,089
stream and these trees have roots right

1094
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:26,869
in the stream so it could be an

1095
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,970
interesting

1096
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:31,339
woody addition to any kind of replanting

1097
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:33,739
strategy if you consider that a lot of

1098
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,350
the downstream and current site draws

1099
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:41,089
are an element of tourism or an element

1100
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:44,659
of that ecological experience or novelty

1101
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:48,829
when it comes to rhetoric another

1102
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:52,659
interesting native tree Kentucky coffee

1103
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:55,519
tree there they have lost their

1104
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:57,099
evolutionary seed spreaders whenever the

1105
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,190
large arthropods

1106
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:02,739
excuse me large herbivores left the

1107
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:04,090
continent so you're only going to find

1108
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:06,549
this tree where it seeds just to be able

1109
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,920
long streams but again very competitive

1110
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:11,830
in saturated soils it would establish

1111
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,320
well additionally it's a colony forming

1112
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:16,869
tree if you keep the Beavers on site and

1113
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:21,760
they mow a tree like this down it will

1114
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:25,299
just come back from the roots and yeah

1115
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,450
final concern the Beavers it's it's easy

1116
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,860
to say I just removed them but they do

1117
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:32,139
do a lot of the things that one might be

1118
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,579
trying to accomplish and a wetland

1119
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:35,469
maintenance or what the restoration

1120
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:37,690
thing they build dams a slow flow they

1121
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:40,539
retain sediment they also eat all the

1122
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:42,970
trees that you try to plant and as we've

1123
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:46,889
seen earlier they do have potential

1124
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:46,889
vectoring of the not lead

1125
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:54,420
so in summary we looked at as many

1126
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,829
things as we could on site and try to

1127
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,400
get physiological characteristics

1128
00:51:55,829 --> 00:52:03,119
getting environmental issues and looking

1129
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,460
at the biotic systems one really

1130
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,289
important ecosystem service clearly is

1131
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,030
that there is sediment being retained as

1132
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:10,619
a sediment that isn't going into

1133
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,269
Buttermilk Falls as a sediment that

1134
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,519
isn't it making it into the inlet or

1135
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:17,519
into the lake so this is a really

1136
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:23,719
powerful Rachel benefit for a lot of

1137
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:26,579
shareholders as far as invasives

1138
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,009
there's always this dichotomy invasives

1139
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:32,250
bad natives good though it comes to a

1140
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,640
large site restoration we've seen these

1141
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:37,139
invasive do some potentially positive

1142
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:40,409
ecosystem services phalaris

1143
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:42,809
is retaining soil all along thanks Wow

1144
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:44,429
there is that woody transition so do we

1145
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:46,349
immediately remove a flare so can we

1146
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:49,319
focus on some of the other things like

1147
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:51,960
the Franklin's and again should the

1148
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,080
beavers go it's would be really

1149
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,449
interesting to track some of those cut

1150
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,039
water it in sections of not only and see

1151
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:00,839
where they're ending up and are they

1152
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,559
establishing on the bank as they get

1153
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,559
through snow away

1154
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,838
we have a little bit before big

1155
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:14,230
decisions have to be made provided to

1156
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:16,808
damn continue standing again about 30

1157
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,940
years before this will entirely fill up

1158
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:22,510
and we'll lose some of those sediment

1159
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:24,579
retention ecosystem services on the

1160
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,440
other side removal of the dam could be

1161
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:28,059
really important when it comes to so

1162
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,400
arthropods are other benthic

1163
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:36,819
invertebrates who use that waterway to

1164
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:38,680
travel up and down as far as gathering

1165
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:41,019
more information there's a lot of

1166
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:42,639
resources locally to us one that we

1167
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:45,460
advocate for and that we refer to a

1168
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:49,710
couple times is the Watkins website they

1169
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:52,568
have a couple of big dams one of them

1170
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:55,869
now is just a successional forest and

1171
00:53:52,568 --> 00:53:58,568
and the other still has that wetland or

1172
00:53:55,869 --> 00:54:00,730
lake feature so it would be interesting

1173
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,679
to determine here's what we want to see

1174
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,269
in the future for Lake treatment and

1175
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,519
then go to these sites and see how those

1176
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:11,440
sites either accommodate or mitigate

1177
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:13,920
reaching those goals and finally I'll

1178
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,920
turn it over

1179
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:24,910
so we had we just want to thank all the

1180
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:27,250
people that facilitated us completing

1181
00:54:24,909 --> 00:54:30,460
our project we couldn't do it alone we

1182
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:32,860
needed the help of experts to kind of

1183
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,320
help us interpret and even do some of

1184
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,480
the things we've done in this project so

1185
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,090
like thank you all and thank you guys

1186
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,780
for being here

1187
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:45,550
and so we threw a lot of information at

1188
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,740
you and you probably need some time to

1189
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,710
digest but you'll have questions so

1190
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:55,149
these are a few resources you can reach

1191
00:54:50,710 --> 00:55:05,530
out to before we publish our report so

1192
00:54:55,150 --> 00:55:06,940
yeah these are some cool all right so

1193
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:09,670
thank you guys and if you have any

1194
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:11,139
questions now's the time and we can

1195
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:15,909
direct it right individual people

1196
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:16,869
specific groups like I've been doing

1197
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:19,420
quite a bit of work on sediment

1198
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:24,909
transport and especially long six-mile

1199
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:26,950
Creek and I have some problems with just

1200
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:30,219
looking at off stream sources of

1201
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:32,739
sediment coming into the lake and not

1202
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:37,029
looking at the possibility of in-stream

1203
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:38,229
sources in six-mile and I think in some

1204
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:42,130
of the other creeks on here but I

1205
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:44,500
haven't got the data we've had a period

1206
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,840
of stream degradation for about the last

1207
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,969
50 years that means the stream has been

1208
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,430
cutting its way down and that's because

1209
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:52,959
the land use has changed I mean

1210
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:56,319
originally when everything is forested

1211
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,539
around here the relative input of

1212
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:02,260
sediment from the uplands and off stream

1213
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:04,420
sources was low and we had narrow

1214
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:07,240
channel Dwight and meandering strings

1215
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:10,079
but when always DeForest didn't turn in

1216
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:13,029
agriculture had tremendous input offset

1217
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,940
Ostrom sediment which caused this James

1218
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,740
to upgrade fill in and become multi

1219
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,269
channel on all this concept and it's I

1220
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:22,149
didn't make that up there people people

1221
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:24,550
are quite aware of that but you know the

1222
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,660
area's become reforested now so what

1223
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,970
does that mean that means there's less

1224
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:30,190
sediment in general coming in from all

1225
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:32,859
stream so what's that mean for the

1226
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,960
stream well the stream had become it

1227
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,720
tried to get an equilibrium with this

1228
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,240
tremendous amount of sediment coming in

1229
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:42,369
which meant it had more energy and now

1230
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,079
it has this energy but it doesn't have

1231
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:46,869
any sediment because there's a balance

1232
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,119
between energy and sediment and so

1233
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:50,829
what's the stream doing is removing that

1234
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,069
sediment that it has been stored in

1235
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:56,289
there and six-mile a lot of internal

1236
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:58,900
crossroad and I've been monitoring the

1237
00:56:56,289 --> 00:57:03,159
stream channel there since nineteen just

1238
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:04,930
after agnes 1972 when we moved in and it

1239
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:08,559
says you know not believe this but that

1240
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:11,889
stream channel has degraded about 14

1241
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:14,949
feet over that period of time it's

1242
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:17,769
they've stabilized it now so that I

1243
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:20,559
can't measurements making it so I think

1244
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:22,840
it's really important to get some

1245
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,690
measurements in upstream in buttermilk

1246
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:30,760
upstream especially not in the gorge

1247
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:34,750
area or a comfortable comfort anyway

1248
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,650
thankful that area but up above that the

1249
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:41,530
stream is out of the bedrock and so

1250
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:45,070
there it's capable of being degraded and

1251
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:47,980
it could very well be like six mile that

1252
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:50,559
a very large fraction of the sediment

1253
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,599
that's coming into like streaming isn't

1254
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,699
from those I'm monitoring to defend

1255
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:56,110
agricultural procedures but it isn't

1256
00:57:54,699 --> 00:57:59,439
coming from those agricultural lands

1257
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:02,700
it's coming from in-stream degradation

1258
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,700
are you yeah

1259
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:09,659
yeah so the point of identifying mirrors

1260
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,369
and hot spots was basically based on the

1261
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:13,288
curb numbers in those areas so

1262
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:15,599
interesting the permeability of soil in

1263
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:17,760
there but the actual calculation for how

1264
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,980
much sediment is being deposited is just

1265
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,019
from an elevation so just how high the

1266
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,789
sediment is now relative to what it was

1267
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:25,409
like before the down the stairs go yeah

1268
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:26,910
okay that's two different things you

1269
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:29,118
mean you're gonna measure how much

1270
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:32,670
sediment is being collected in them

1271
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:39,210
behind the dam okay that's independent

1272
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:41,309
of where it came from and all these soil

1273
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:44,639
measurements and I get an argument with

1274
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:48,210
Todd Walter sometimes enough talking

1275
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:50,940
about this bit it really doesn't do a

1276
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:53,039
good job in on determining how much

1277
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,099
sediments coming from the stream banks

1278
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:59,670
and extreme degradation you you have to

1279
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:02,519
make some measurements and you know it

1280
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:05,670
takes time but maybe there are some data

1281
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:08,219
out there for instance not a nominee

1282
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,909
bridges will cross but the county

1283
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:11,608
engineers

1284
00:59:08,909 --> 00:59:14,308
at least in some bridges always measured

1285
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:16,259
the depth of the channel or the water

1286
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:19,170
surface I don't know but there's some

1287
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:21,750
not the best data but there's some data

1288
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,430
there that could be used to determine

1289
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,768
whether or not there's significant

1290
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:28,190
degradation going on upstream at

1291
00:59:25,768 --> 00:59:28,189
upstream

1292
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:38,119
I have a question for the invasive

1293
00:59:34,518 --> 00:59:40,879
species team you looked carefully at

1294
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:43,039
beaver and the potential impact that

1295
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,489
they may be happening with Japanese

1296
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:50,180
knotweed did you also look for evidence

1297
00:59:46,489 --> 01:00:02,989
of beer browsing and how that might be

1298
00:59:50,179 --> 01:00:05,179
impacting the species distribution we

1299
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:06,650
like to call knotweed Islands that and

1300
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:09,409
the judge show you where all the topic

1301
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:11,710
was cut down by the viewers so there is

1302
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:14,748
maybe some potentials for it here

1303
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:16,068
here's also browsing and interfering

1304
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:18,018
with some of the species composition

1305
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:21,670
within the March but it's definitely

1306
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:25,179
something we should look more into I

1307
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:29,559
know we've seen deer and deer droppings

1308
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:29,558
frequently as we hike that trail

1309
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:43,119
just anecdotally up we have knotweed

1310
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:47,650
problem and there's I don't give a damn

1311
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:50,108
how much that beavers are exacerbating

1312
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:52,059
that problem but it ain't gonna stop

1313
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:54,338
every little piece of not week it comes

1314
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:58,150
downstream it has the capability of

1315
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:59,980
reroute and if if there's not weed

1316
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:09,030
upstream sooner or later it's gonna be

1317
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:11,469
not way downstream well I think that

1318
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:13,769
same thinking about getting rid of

1319
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:17,469
Beaver because they might be

1320
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:18,880
transporting knotweed is not a I mean

1321
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:22,348
maybe get rid of beaver for a different

1322
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,349
reason but I don't think that's a reason

1323
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:37,340
also get rid of that problem but just

1324
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:39,859
you know trying to minimize the

1325
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:42,579
the more complain more spread of it with

1326
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:44,539
the Beavers also present on the site

1327
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:49,989
we've been trying to get it we're not

1328
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:49,989
wait it's it's almost impossible yeah

1329
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,139
yeah I I certainly wish deer would eat

1330
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:07,809
more of it Elliott in the springtime

1331
01:01:57,139 --> 01:02:23,929
they will need something that needs

1332
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:28,400
another question this is a class project

1333
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:31,759
and like every time I've offered this

1334
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,789
class for the past 16 years we take on a

1335
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,630
pro bono consulting project for a local

1336
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:41,659
government or nonprofit and this fits

1337
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:44,960
into that context very well where it

1338
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:45,769
will go from here kind of remains to be

1339
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,050
seen

1340
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:53,590
I'll suggest as an example five years

1341
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:58,250
ago we looked at Spencer Lake and

1342
01:02:53,590 --> 01:03:02,630
Spencer Lake has a low head dam shorter

1343
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:06,079
dam not not as tall as this dam and the

1344
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:08,990
Corps of Engineers and State Dec wanted

1345
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:14,659
the dam removed it dated from the 1820s

1346
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:18,379
and they were assuming that Spencer Lake

1347
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:20,690
was 50 feet deep and that could pretty

1348
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,690
much wipe out the down you know the

1349
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:25,760
downtown portion of Spencer had this dam

1350
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:28,220
failed so we did a lot of bad things

1351
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,950
read down there and we found that yes

1352
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:33,980
there are some I smell pockets there

1353
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:38,619
that are 50 feet deep but upstream of

1354
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:42,710
the dam there is a subsurface Ridge and

1355
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:47,659
only about 30 centimeters of water over

1356
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:51,470
that Ridge so should the dam break for

1357
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:55,129
example the likelihood of 50 feet of

1358
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:57,409
water times 29 acres blowing out the

1359
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:02,650
town of Spencer were relatively small

1360
01:03:57,409 --> 01:04:05,299
well they have been the the state was

1361
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:07,789
people who came to this presentation

1362
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:12,890
that presentation very like that were

1363
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:17,420
very they said huh who knew they have

1364
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:20,420
still yet to figure out exactly what the

1365
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:22,550
proper course of action should be and

1366
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,889
you're sitting next to a former student

1367
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:31,310
in this class who worked on the Spencer

1368
01:04:24,889 --> 01:04:39,469
Lake project and so as far as where it

1369
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:42,049
will go this will inform state and local

1370
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:45,769
and perhaps even federal authorities on

1371
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:48,320
deciding where it should go you know

1372
01:04:45,769 --> 01:04:54,019
where they would like it to go but this

1373
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:57,170
is a not exactly a one-off thing but it

1374
01:04:54,019 --> 01:05:02,780
is a class project and tomorrow is the

1375
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:04,730
last day of the semester so we're not

1376
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:09,350
kissing the project goodbye there will

1377
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:12,740
be a report a technical report that will

1378
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:15,039
hang out and continue to stimulate

1379
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:17,599
discussion and hopefully inform

1380
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,809
decisions and yes Jim yeah I would like

1381
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,389
to say it build off that very much as a

1382
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:26,059
representative of state parks we are I

1383
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:27,920
think we got a ton out of this we have

1384
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:30,829
we had worked with with Tom and with the

1385
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,809
classes to trying to help inform a

1386
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:36,259
resource management plan for that area

1387
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:38,570
which is important for us and so we've

1388
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,079
got representatives from our field team

1389
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,900
here

1390
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:44,119
planning Park operations and basis

1391
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:47,690
patient invasive species as well as

1392
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:50,059
educational department so we there's

1393
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:52,749
stuff in here already I think we can we

1394
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:55,278
can act on that some small-scale stuff

1395
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:57,588
that's going to have some impact so we

1396
01:05:55,278 --> 01:05:59,599
feel like we've got a little bit of a

1397
01:05:57,588 --> 01:06:02,119
roadmap much greater understanding and

1398
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:05,289
then as far as it did the dam go is it

1399
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:07,278
also has some historical significance

1400
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:10,579
artifact that the Civilian Conservation

1401
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:13,639
Corps so we have several mandates that

1402
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:15,499
we that were required to live up to and

1403
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:17,868
having this information it's going to

1404
01:06:15,498 --> 01:06:21,409
really help us to do that so we're

1405
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:26,150
looking forward to taking it yeah great

1406
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:28,728
so are there other other questions or or

1407
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,950
comments I just had a quick question for

1408
01:06:28,728 --> 01:06:32,449
the class amongst all of you if

1409
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:34,998
anybody's strongly feel that should be

1410
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:36,649
returned to a lake or somebody like no

1411
01:06:34,998 --> 01:06:39,259
one's gonna say a marsh it was very

1412
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:42,709
debate about where it should go or what

1413
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:44,778
it should be I think like the different

1414
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:46,788
groups were like prioritizing different

1415
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:49,400
aspects of the system so like it

1416
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:51,769
performs like a variety of services but

1417
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,778
like ideologically for instance it would

1418
01:06:51,768 --> 01:06:55,939
be nice if we could redirect flow and

1419
01:06:53,778 --> 01:06:58,219
like a little more flexibility but then

1420
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:01,759
like the invasives think probably far

1421
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:02,840
like trade-offs between like water lake

1422
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:06,510
divers

1423
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:10,850
I think overall we think that retaining

1424
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:10,850
some aspect of the marsh is definitely

1425
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:21,030
this by the way is another former

1426
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:25,609
student in this class who thank you very

1427
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:28,920
much for coming over here so in terms of

1428
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:30,960
larger impact these guys do go out and

1429
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:35,610
actually do things and I'd like to think

1430
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:38,280
that in time and over the course of

1431
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:42,329
their professional careers it does

1432
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:47,940
influence the way they approach problems

1433
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:51,960
and things like that so okay

1434
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:54,030
thank you very much everyone and if you

1435
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,389
want to ask additional questions I'm

1436
01:07:54,030 --> 01:08:02,090
sure the students would be eager and

1437
01:07:57,389 --> 01:08:02,089
available to answer those thank you
