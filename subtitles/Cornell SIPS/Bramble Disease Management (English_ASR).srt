1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,650
the red

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,960
of raspberries there's over 33 virus and

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,359
virus like diseases reported on brambles

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,179
worldwide and over 15 in North America

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,460
but fortunately only a few are common in

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:21,679
eastern North America in this

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,750
presentation I'll go over the important

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,059
features about virus diseases and

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,820
discuss the virus diseases that I have

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,890
seen in Ontario really just a few I'll

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,289
provide information on how to confirm a

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,480
suspected virus disease and I'll end

13
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:38,060
with information on how to control or

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:42,219
really prevent virus diseases on your

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:45,290
farm so first of all what is a virus

16
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:47,780
while the virus is a microbe that can

17
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:50,119
cause disease in this case plant disease

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,859
now some viruses affect human health but

19
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,179
it's important to know that the viruses

20
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,439
that affect plants do not infect humans

21
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:59,689
viruses are quite different from the

22
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,179
fungal pathogens that cause many of the

23
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,489
bramble diseases we know first of all

24
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,769
viruses are much smaller they can only

25
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,868
be seen with an electron microscope and

26
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:12,048
they're really just protein particles

27
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:14,599
not even cells so they require a living

28
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,200
host and a cell in order to grow and to

29
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,899
multiply viruses can move systemically

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,999
in a plant so unfortunately once

31
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:26,108
infected the whole plant and all the

32
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:29,658
plant parts could carry virus particles

33
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:34,118
unlike other plant pathogens there are

34
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:36,969
no chemical controls for virus diseases

35
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:40,159
now because viruses live and multiply

36
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:42,978
inside plant cells they disrupt plant

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,530
cell processes and this can cause many

38
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,688
many different types of symptoms and the

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,179
the type of symptom that's expressed by

40
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:52,458
viruses depends not only on the virus

41
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:55,490
but it can depend on the time of year

42
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:58,159
the variety infect it and the number of

43
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:00,199
viruses present in the plant so these

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,389
symptoms include things like crumbly

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,219
fruit or yellowing or spotting of the

46
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:08,959
tissue leaf curl and low plant vigor

47
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:11,060
virus diseases are often named after the

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,670
symptoms that they caused for example

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,120
raspberry bushy dwarf virus is one of

50
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:18,768
the viruses we'll be talking about today

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,759
one thing about virus disease is the

52
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:22,489
symptoms show up

53
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,560
best in ten to show up best in cooler

54
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:27,620
weather especially in the spring and on

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,019
newer growth and the symptoms can

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,209
disappear after a while but even if the

57
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,280
symptoms on an infected plant go away

58
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,709
the plant is still infected with virus

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,009
and can still spread viruses to other

60
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,509
plants sometimes infected plants show no

61
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:44,090
symptoms at all and when this is the

62
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:46,669
case we say that the virus is latent and

63
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,670
for example virus symptoms are often

64
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:55,609
latent on wild or alternate hosts for

65
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:57,649
the virus disease this is one of the

66
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,709
most serious symptoms that virus

67
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,840
diseases can cause in raspberries and we

68
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,840
call this crumbly fruit or crumbly berry

69
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:11,750
another symptom is leaf model or or leaf

70
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:15,229
yellowing and you can see here the

71
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,318
irregular pattern of yellow and green

72
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:24,918
it's not too consistent it's not quite

73
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:27,078
typical of herbicide injury and this is

74
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,630
another symptom of viruses a very

75
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,540
unusual pattern of yellowing that's

76
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,909
associated with a virus disease the

77
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:40,189
pattern again is very inconsistent and

78
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:42,620
it's very variable in the leaf and this

79
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:44,870
symptom can come and go and is more

80
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,319
commonly seen in the initial stages of

81
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,319
infection

82
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,658
now this symptom of virus disease is

83
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,060
known as vein clearing it looks a lot

84
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,798
like herbicide injury but this is a

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,900
raspberry play in my garden these

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,969
symptoms show up year after year in the

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,219
spring and then they fade away and

88
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,598
disappear I'm pretty sure it's a virus

89
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,150
disease because I've never used

90
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,280
herbicides in my garden and also the

91
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,410
fruit from these plants is very very

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,600
crumbly now the last thing I need to

93
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,939
define before I get more specific about

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,169
raspberry virus diseases is what is a

95
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,610
vector viruses do not multiply outside

96
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,889
of the plants that they live in

97
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,689
and unlike fungal diseases they don't

98
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,538
produce spores that are carried in the

99
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:36,240
wind or splashed by rain and fires any

100
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:38,310
diseases need help to move around and

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,620
they need a wound to enter the plants

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,850
and the agent that spreads a virus

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,829
disease is what we call the vector some

104
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,169
virus diseases are spread by insects

105
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:51,089
most commonly aphids and leaf hoppers or

106
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:54,000
other pests with piercing sucking

107
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:56,129
mouthparts some viruses are spread by

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,220
pollen or seed and these are very

109
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,199
difficult to control and other viruses

110
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,300
can be spread by mechanical transmission

111
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,909
that takes place when there's grafting

112
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,680
or budding done on the plant and there

113
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,110
are are nematodes particularly the

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,030
dagger nematode that can spread viruses

115
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:17,729
from plant to plant now raspberry virus

116
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:20,969
diseases are generally classified by the

117
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:22,409
type of vector that spreads them and so

118
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,930
today I'm going to talk about these

119
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,060
three raspberry virus diseases raspberry

120
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,910
mosaic and leaf curl which are spread by

121
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,129
aphids the tomato ringspot virus which

122
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,139
is spread by dagger nematodes and the

123
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:40,168
raspberry bush ador virus that's spread

124
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:44,069
by pollen so to start with the the aphid

125
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:46,259
borne viruses there are two a food borne

126
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,348
viruses which seemed to occur in

127
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,240
northeastern america these virus

128
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,038
diseases are really important in the

129
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,689
Pacific Northwest where they grow a lot

130
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,418
of raspberries and we're a fad

131
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:59,759
populations tend to be higher but the

132
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,519
raspberry mosaic virus is also found in

133
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,149
the Northeast and but personally I've

134
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,939
never seen

135
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,519
the leaf curl virus these viruses are

136
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,250
vectored by a Fitz particularly the

137
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,740
large raspberry aphid which is common in

138
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,540
the Northeast but not abundant and the

139
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,650
small raspberry feed which hasn't

140
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,810
actually been reported in Ontario the

141
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:24,599
only host for both the aphids and these

142
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,790
virus diseases are raspberries and this

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,640
fact is very important when it comes to

144
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:35,580
controlling this virus disease or aphid

145
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:38,339
borne viruses now raspberry mosaic virus

146
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,620
is really a complex of different virus

147
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,349
diseases but it's all they're all spread

148
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,120
by the large raspberry Avett and so we

149
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:49,200
caught we talked about raspberry mosaic

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,629
or the raspberry mosaic complex this

151
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,949
disease shows up very often in black

152
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:56,310
raspberries which are the most

153
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:59,219
susceptible in black raspberries mosaic

154
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,180
can cause tip necrosis or die Bach leaf

155
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,310
model and reduced vigor and yield in red

156
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,769
raspberries which are less susceptible

157
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,110
you may not see any symptoms unless

158
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,810
there are two or more viruses in the

159
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,210
plant two or more different viruses in

160
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,910
the same plant in this case you'll get

161
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:20,250
symptoms which resemble leaf model or

162
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,910
yellows and definitely a decline in

163
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,649
plant vigor and small or crumbly fruit

164
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,800
the disease is also present in wild

165
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:31,589
raspberries and often symptomless so

166
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,990
problems occur when a Fedora symptomless

167
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,239
hosts for example wild raspberries in

168
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,340
the nearby woods or bush and they bring

169
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,960
the virus to your healthy previously

170
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:46,789
healthy planting so one of the symptoms

171
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:50,430
of mosaic virus in black raspberries is

172
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:55,290
tip necrosis the growing tip blackens

173
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:57,360
and bends and and dries up and another

174
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,550
symptom of mosaic virus would be this

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,189
leaf model you can see the yellowish

176
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,040
spots on a darker background and this

177
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:07,699
type of symptom is more easy to to see

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,700
in the spring

179
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,649
the plant in this picture was not

180
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,839
confirmed as having a virus disease but

181
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:19,299
I wanted to show you it - as something

182
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,479
that could be a virus especially when

183
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,480
you see this leaf puckering oh there's

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,270
the arrow this that the deep kind of

185
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,689
puckering and in yellow modeling on the

186
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,689
new growth

187
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,360
so to control mosaic virus and these are

188
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:45,159
the virus diseases that are spread by

189
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,529
aphids you really need to prevent the

190
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:51,129
aphids from moving from infected plants

191
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,870
to non infected plants so first start

192
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,689
new raspberry plantings with

193
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,549
disease-free stalk that means grown in a

194
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,430
plant propagation program that uses

195
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:02,829
virus free nuclear stock and tests for

196
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:06,009
viruses throughout the program and

197
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:10,210
secondly it's important to isolate new

198
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:12,100
raspberry plantings from wild hosts you

199
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,110
should also separate black raspberries

200
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,360
from red raspberry plantings and this is

201
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,120
because red raspberries could have the

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,649
virus but not have symptoms and they're

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,870
more likely to spread the disease to

204
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,240
susceptible black raspberry plantings

205
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,120
nearby before you even know you have the

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,610
problem a minimum separation distance is

207
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,279
about 500 feet but a thousand feet or

208
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,680
more would be better these distances are

209
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,079
not foolproof but they are greater than

210
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,809
the distance an aphid is likely to fly

211
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,030
the problem is that if it's also spread

212
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,709
in prevailing winds and air currents and

213
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,120
so if possible you should think about

214
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,389
this when you're laying out a new

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,889
planting you may be surprised to know

216
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,649
that spraying insecticides to control

217
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:55,659
aphids is not really that useful this is

218
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,029
because Athens can spread the virus more

219
00:09:55,659 --> 00:10:00,159
quickly than they would be killed by an

220
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,740
insecticide there are a few examples

221
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,600
when you might want to control aphids to

222
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,460
control viruses and I'll explain these

223
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,680
later finally many raspberry varieties

224
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,190
are resistant to the large raspberry a

225
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,559
Fed

226
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,300
this is particularly true of varieties

227
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,789
that are grown in the Pacific Northwest

228
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:21,669
and this a fedora Sisseton s-- is an

229
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:27,250
important way to control the spread of

230
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:29,279
virus diseases I tried to find some

231
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,110
examples of avian resistant cultivars

232
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,269
some of the older cultivars like Newberg

233
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,700
and Latham are definitely susceptible to

234
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,669
the large raspberry a fad and so these

235
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,350
are very susceptible to mosaic virus

236
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:44,949
whereas some other cultivars such as can

237
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,009
be revelry and Algonquian have this AG

238
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,200
gene where

239
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:52,580
comes from a parent plant breeders know

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:55,040
how to transfer or breed for varieties

241
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,620
that have this AG gene and are therefore

242
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,529
resistant to aphids and the virus but

243
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,600
unfortunately I couldn't find a lot of

244
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:04,610
information about this resistance in

245
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,389
some of our modern-day cultivars grown

246
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,389
in the Northeast

247
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,259
okay the next virus I'd like to talk

248
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,990
about and this is the one that I see the

249
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:17,269
most often is the tomato ringspot virus

250
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,820
it attacks red raspberries and

251
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,889
blackberries but not black raspberries

252
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:27,950
apparently and the symptoms can range

253
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:31,039
from from none to severe it's spread by

254
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,950
the degra nematode so it's really only a

255
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,819
problem in soils where diagur nematodes

256
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,490
are found in contrast to the mosaic

257
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,590
virus however which only occurs in the

258
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,169
raspberry genus rubus tomato ringspot

259
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,110
virus can be found in over 35 different

260
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:50,659
plant families including strawberries

261
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,090
apples peaches tomatoes and many

262
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:54,740
different broad-leaved weeds so we're

263
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,330
going to have a different approach to

264
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,680
controlling this virus in raspberries I

265
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,720
mentioned the symptoms are variable a

266
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,329
little unreliable for diagnosing this

267
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,509
virus it's generally associated with

268
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,870
decline crumbly fruit a loss in

269
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:13,549
productivity in infected plants early in

270
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,980
the onset of the disease you'll see

271
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:18,740
distinct ring spots or foliage patterns

272
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,899
on the primocane growth and these

273
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,299
symptoms are known as shock symptoms and

274
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,549
they show up early in the infection or

275
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:30,159
the year after infection and they may

276
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:30,159
not show up again in infected plants

277
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,580
and here's another picture of crumbly

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,500
fruit in this case it was caused by the

279
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,389
tomato ringspot virus like I said I see

280
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,759
this virus most often in Ontario because

281
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,649
the disease is spread by nematodes from

282
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,649
plant to plant it does spread fairly

283
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,750
slowly in the field infecting a few more

284
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,870
plants every year generally up and down

285
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,950
the row because you're spreading

286
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,100
nematodes with your tillage equipment

287
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:05,350
and and farm equipment and they're not

288
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,350
moving really quickly through a planting

289
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,919
it's just another symptom of of some of

290
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,730
the leaf leaf pattern that I saw last

291
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:21,169
summer on a field of Nova with tomato

292
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,690
ringspot virus and the crumbly fruit

293
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:28,339
that you've probably seen the fruit just

294
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:31,820
breaks breaks up when you pick it so to

295
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,160
control tomato ringspot virus first of

296
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,920
all you need to start with disease-free

297
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,750
planting stock but the virus could

298
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,539
already be on your farm in one of its

299
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,490
many weedy or alternate hosts so before

300
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,289
sit before planting raspberries you

301
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,289
should sample soil for nematodes and

302
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:49,909
control them if necessary and if dagger

303
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:53,569
nematodes were present in your soil

304
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:56,750
samples you would control them by soil

305
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,370
fumigation for example or or growing an

306
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,370
alternate crop for some years

307
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,310
I see tomato ringspot virus the most in

308
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:09,799
old in planting sites which were

309
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,869
previously an orchard or pasture I'm not

310
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,490
really sure why but these are likely to

311
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,000
have lots of the perennial broad-leaved

312
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,159
weeds that harbor tomato ringspot virus

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,198
so controlling weeds as well as the

314
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,879
nematodes can help reduce the incidence

315
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:27,379
and spread of tomato ringspot virus

316
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,990
now the third virus is the raspberry

317
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:33,828
bushy dwarf virus and the vector for

318
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,870
this is pollen from infected plants so

319
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:39,469
this can be a very difficult virus to

320
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:42,078
control it only attacks raspberries the

321
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,480
symptoms again vary with the cultivar in

322
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,239
the season and plants may or may not

323
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,820
show symptoms each year but it is a

324
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,980
serious virus because it causes crumbly

325
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,379
berry in some cultivars and it's

326
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,800
associates associated with a decline in

327
00:14:54,379 --> 00:15:00,259
productivity these are some of the leaf

328
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,469
symptoms we see in the spring with

329
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:05,569
raspberry bushes or virus for years I've

330
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,370
missed diagnosed this as herbicide

331
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,970
damage it does look quite a lot like

332
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,889
herbicide injury this is another picture

333
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,339
of raspberry bushes were fond the

334
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,528
variety Qualicum this irregular

335
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:23,690
bleaching is less consistent with

336
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:25,490
herbicide injury this is a field of

337
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,149
primal keen fruiting varieties in the

338
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,549
spring

339
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:31,039
both are infected with the raspberry

340
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:33,078
bushy Dorf virus but the variety autumn

341
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,328
britain on the Left shows much more

342
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:38,769
distinct symptoms than the variety

343
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:38,769
Caroline which is on the right

344
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,509
as I said it's very difficult to control

345
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,220
raspberry bushi door virus but again you

346
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,259
should also start always start your

347
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,410
plantings with disease-free planting

348
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:55,389
stock if you do see symptoms of this

349
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:57,219
virus or any of the other virus diseases

350
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,919
you should rogue out those plants if

351
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,830
possible remove the infected plants and

352
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,169
plants on either side there's very few

353
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,360
resistant cultivars to raspberry bushes

354
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:09,669
or virus the variety Chilcotin

355
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,139
apparently is resistant this is a

356
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,269
variety that's grown mostly in the

357
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:16,449
Pacific Northwest it's not very winter

358
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,399
hardy in Ontario and there are strains

359
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,960
of the raspberry bushes or virus

360
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:26,879
apparently which can break through the

361
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,879
genetic resistance of these raspberries

362
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,100
now it's always a little difficult to

363
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,800
diagnose virus diseases so I'm going to

364
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,090
spend a bit of time on that topic first

365
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,209
of all there's a lot of symptoms that

366
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,269
can look like viruses so before you can

367
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,860
be sure that you have a virus or before

368
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,240
you even test for viruses you should

369
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,620
consider some of these other

370
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,899
possibilities for example past herbicide

371
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,279
applications would be good to know you

372
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,559
should check out the nutritional status

373
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,939
of your crop with leaf and soil analysis

374
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:03,879
and scout for other insects and diseases

375
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:06,100
this symptom is caused by herbicide from

376
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,259
glyphosate or roundup you've probably

377
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,149
seen it in raspberries the symptoms show

378
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:12,490
up the year after the roundup was

379
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,650
applied or drifted on to the crop but

380
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,230
the chlorosis and the yellowing and the

381
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,550
small stunted leaves could be mistaken

382
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,549
for virus diseases

383
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:26,629
potato leafhopper can cause a leaf model

384
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,060
or yellowing or leaf curl particularly

385
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,040
on the new growth in this case a crop

386
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,779
Scout should find evidence of leaf

387
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,779
hoppers on the lower leaf surface

388
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:39,200
tarnished plant bugs occasionally

389
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,960
damaged the drupelets when the fruit is

390
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,670
sizing in the fruit can be deformed or

391
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,220
poor pollination especially in the

392
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,100
greenhouse can result in crumbly or

393
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,549
deformed fruit I've seen crumbly berry

394
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:55,429
associated with too low of a soil pH or

395
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,440
inadequate crop crop nutrition when some

396
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,570
varieties are just weak necked and tend

397
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,180
to break up a little more easily than

398
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:04,099
others but if crumbly fruit predominates

399
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,470
on a few plants in your planting and

400
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,299
more plants are affected every year you

401
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,009
should have samples tested for virus

402
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:16,009
diseases so how do you diagnose a virus

403
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:18,200
disease well you need to use the

404
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:21,789
services of a lab that has green house

405
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,750
or lab facilities there's two

406
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:26,809
characteristic tests that are done to

407
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,569
test for viruses most diagnostic labs

408
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,569
will carry ELISA test kits for the

409
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:34,879
common virus diseases when you use

410
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:37,639
anna-lysa tests you need one test for

411
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,750
each known virus and what happens is the

412
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,060
virus from the infected tissue to put it

413
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,180
very simply and probably not quite

414
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,789
accurately the virus from infected

415
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,840
tissue reacts in the presence of

416
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,399
antibodies and added enzymes which are

417
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:59,049
which are put in these little plates in

418
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,690
the little Eliza plates on your left

419
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:04,849
more recently PCR techniques or

420
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,130
polymerase chain reaction techniques are

421
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:09,319
used to identify specific viruses or

422
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,720
groups of viruses by their genetic

423
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,549
material these tests are fairly

424
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,370
expensive and they're not done at many

425
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:19,069
labs PCR tests though can be used to

426
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:21,889
detect families or groups of viruses if

427
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:24,529
you know the genetic code but my whole

428
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,720
point is really to identify and confirm

429
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,480
a virus disease you need a diagnostic

430
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,039
lab that is equipped to diagnose the

431
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,039
common diseases of brambles

432
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,460
so here's a slide to show some of the

433
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,110
labs you could consider depending which

434
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,019
country you're in

435
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:46,240
to send some samples for disease

436
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,490
diagnosis or confirmation of a virus

437
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,769
disease you should pick a lab and then

438
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,700
call first to get the price list to find

439
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:58,329
out what what it's going to cost what

440
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,850
viruses these labs can test for egg dia

441
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:04,059
is a very good lab I believe it's in

442
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:07,000
Indiana in the USA it's well equipped to

443
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,889
diagnose virus diseases and the website

444
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,069
for egg dia has good information about

445
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,770
how viruses are diagnosed and they have

446
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:16,869
a price list up there two other labs you

447
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:18,609
might consider are if you're in Ontario

448
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:22,149
the pest diagnostic clinic at the

449
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:24,939
University of Guelph or Ann New York the

450
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,070
plant disease diagnostic clinic like I

451
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,610
said it's best to call ahead find out

452
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:32,439
what virus kits they have on hand and it

453
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,449
does get very difficult to ship

454
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,400
plant samples across the border so if

455
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,340
you're in Canada you need to use a lab

456
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,420
in Canada and the same in the States use

457
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:45,220
an American lab but whatever lab you use

458
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,800
choose fresh samples of plant tissue

459
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,690
with symptoms and remember that viruses

460
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,879
are easiest to detect in the spring

461
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,490
because the concentration or a titer of

462
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,280
the virus in the tissue is highest then

463
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,650
and at other times of the year you may

464
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,269
be more likely to get false negative

465
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:06,790
results and you should test again the

466
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:08,589
next year okay so my last few slides

467
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,409
have to do with controlling virus

468
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:14,019
diseases but really what you're trying

469
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,210
to do is prevent virus diseases from

470
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,039
getting onto your farm and I think I've

471
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,230
said this already a couple of times one

472
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,049
of the most important things is to start

473
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,690
with clean planting stalk don't grow

474
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,639
your own raspberries even though it may

475
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,420
seem like an economical option at the

476
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,400
time a professional plant propagator

477
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,830
will use parent material that has been

478
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,810
freed from viruses usually through a

479
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,879
combination of heat treatment and tissue

480
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:44,049
culture from the growing tip of the

481
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,210
plant this is the screen house analyst

482
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,549
Kurt were a nuclear stalk for on

483
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,200
Theriault plant growers is produced you

484
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,210
can see several features on this

485
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,000
building which are designed to keep

486
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,759
virus vectors like aphids away they're

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,329
screened vents double air locked

488
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:05,369
entrance and there's no weeds around the

489
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:05,369
edges of this screen house

490
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:12,079
certified practices for nursery

491
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,418
production include growing plants in

492
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,398
fumigated or nematode free soil

493
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:19,799
isolation from wild hosts and regular

494
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:21,808
scouting and pest control so your

495
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:24,658
nursery growers plant growers are going

496
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:27,629
to a lot of extra steps to make sure

497
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,870
that the risk of viruses is very low in

498
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:35,370
their fields the second thing you should

499
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:37,379
do is try to isolate raspberry plantings

500
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,209
from virus sources now that I know this

501
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,000
isn't always practical but it should be

502
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,250
in the back of your mind and isolation

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,740
slows the movement of aphids from

504
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,630
infested plantings to new plantings and

505
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,990
this is really important for controlling

506
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,659
mosaic viruses so a separation from wild

507
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,429
brambles older plantings and separating

508
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:01,250
red raspberries from blackberries is a

509
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:04,620
rule of thumb the third thing is to

510
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:07,500
return the routinely identify and remove

511
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:10,168
infected plants this is known as rogen

512
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,019
you would scout for symptoms and remove

513
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:15,600
infected plants maybe twice a year now

514
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,339
this strategy can be effective when less

515
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,699
than five to ten percent of the plants

516
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,918
are infected otherwise if more than that

517
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,960
is infected I guess you should remove

518
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,528
the whole planting when it's no longer

519
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,778
making money for you now the one time

520
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:32,730
you might control aphids is before

521
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:35,308
removing these infected plants from your

522
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,899
planting because a spray for a if it's

523
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:38,730
to kill the aphids before you pull out

524
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:41,579
the plant will help prevent these aphids

525
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,909
from flying on to new uninfected plants

526
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:46,740
I already talked a bit about weed

527
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,960
control and nematode control as a

528
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,149
strategy for controlling tomato ringspot

529
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,038
virus just remember that many

530
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:55,648
broad-leaved weeds are sources for this

531
00:23:53,038 --> 00:24:00,898
virus and that degra nematodes have many

532
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:03,808
hosts and finally I promised to talk a

533
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:06,388
tiny bit about a food control I

534
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:08,788
mentioned it's not feasible to prevent

535
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:11,369
virus infection into new fields

536
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:13,109
generally by controlling aphids you

537
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,388
would have to spray far too frequently

538
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:17,119
and aphids can quickly transmit the

539
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:21,229
disease to two

540
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,699
a raspberry plant so spraying routinely

541
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,860
for aphids is something a plant

542
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,600
propagator does but it's not really

543
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:29,119
something that's practical on a field

544
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,159
scale however there are a couple of

545
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,919
times when controlling aphids might be

546
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,290
useful and this would be if you have an

547
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,360
infested planting and you want to reduce

548
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,099
the rate of spread within that planting

549
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:46,969
and the other is when you're removing

550
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:48,740
plants as you can see the references and

551
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,200
published literature on virus diseases

552
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,029
of raspberry small fruit is somewhat

553
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,160
dated these are some of the sources I

554
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:58,490
used when I was compiling this

555
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,860
presentation but our our knowledge of

556
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,289
virus diseases is changing especially in

557
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,969
the last decade and new techniques are

558
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:07,670
being developed for diagnosing virus

559
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,589
diseases I'm pretty sure that we all are

560
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:13,460
going to know a lot more about virus

561
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:19,298
diseases in the future and and in the

562
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:22,960
years to come thank you

563
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:25,868
thanks Pam there is one question from

564
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,369
Tom Stevenson about potato leafhopper

565
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:30,808
and whether that's a concern for

566
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:30,808
vectoring bramble virus

567
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:37,319
it would not be a common vector of

568
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,109
bramble viruses that we know having said

569
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:43,259
that there are some other virus like

570
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:52,979
diseases which I didn't discuss known as

571
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:55,859
phyto planned so it's not something I

572
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,069
would be extremely concerned about from

573
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:01,798
that perspective all right thank you but

574
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:04,888
I do have a caveat there I do have a

575
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,960
caveat in that our knowledge about the

576
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:10,469
types of virus diseases and Fido plans

577
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,179
is is changing a lot a few people are

578
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,730
working very hard in this field and

579
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:19,470
they're always discovering new new virus

580
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:22,200
diseases okay great thank you and Marvin

581
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,269
has a question about the importance of

582
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,730
separating black and red raspberries and

583
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:30,200
new plantings that are established with

584
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,200
virus indexed plants

585
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,940
so the assumption then is that you don't

586
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:42,150
have virus in your in your plantings and

587
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,890
so do you need to separate them and you

588
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,048
know to tell you the truth I don't see a

589
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,169
lot of separation between red and black

590
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:50,940
raspberries but I think if there's a

591
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:53,850
chance that your red raspberries are

592
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,308
going to get mosaic virus from a feds

593
00:26:53,849 --> 00:27:02,250
from the woods or the bush or a lot of

594
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:03,990
wild brambles nearby then the the theory

595
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,169
would be if you separated those from

596
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:11,130
your blacks you would reduce the spread

597
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:12,419
to the black raspberries but the black

598
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,309
raspberries are going to be close to

599
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,770
those wild sources too so it's a good

600
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:19,319
point Marvin and I think it's one of

601
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:22,589
those motherhood recommendations that

602
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,319
you would do if you could but you might

603
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:27,408
not always do okay I like that I've

604
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,259
never heard that before but I like that

605
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:33,570
description

606
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:36,419
yeah does anyone else have any questions

607
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:41,099
for Pam well she's just finishing with

608
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,140
the virus disease no other questions so

609
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,230
I know some folks don't like to type so

610
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,140
much but I let you keep throwing up some

611
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:53,700
questions while I change our

612
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,890
presentations and Pam will be at the

613
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,690
we'll be still here for the remainder of

614
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,059
this so if you have if you do think of

615
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,538
something don't hesitate to just take

616
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,980
your time and type it in there and and

617
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:07,859
that would be great and now I'm going to

618
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:11,308
introduce our second speaker who is dr.

619
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:12,869
Carrick Cox dr. Cox has a program of

620
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:15,329
tree fruit and berry research and

621
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:17,038
extension at Cornell University's New

622
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:20,069
York State Agricultural Experiment

623
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,169
Station in Geneva dr. Cox's program

624
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:25,168
focuses on the chemical management of

625
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:27,929
fungal diseases of Apple stone fruit and

626
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:30,690
berries with specific emphasis on the

627
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,759
biology ecology mechanisms and

628
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,130
prevalence prevalence excuse me a

629
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,058
fungicide resistance in brown rot and

630
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:41,250
apple scab but he has been instrumental

631
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:42,879
helping me certainly and others in the

632
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,210
extension field in New York

633
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,790
very crop diseases and so I will turn

634
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:53,460
off my speaker now and turn it over to

635
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,460
you Carrick and Pam thank you very much

636
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,960
you

637
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,269
you

638
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,399
you

639
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,100
root diseases but I think we'll get to

640
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,159
the crux of it

641
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,159
you

642
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,509
I'm going to go over a couple of

643
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,509
items

644
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,289
Kerrick this is Laura I'm sorry to

645
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:43,799
interrupt but I think we're having a

646
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:46,309
problem with your audio hold on one

647
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,309
second

648
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:59,099
carick ok I'm sorry this is Laura and we

649
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,079
are having pretty some I think pretty

650
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:03,839
severe where I'm not hearing you at all

651
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,289
hardly and other folks are saying that

652
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,619
the audio is cutting in and out what if

653
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:13,309
I do

654
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:19,409
high volume there you know and Boop's

655
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:21,960
do you have your headset on ok now your

656
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,230
I'm hearing you now are you did you put

657
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,430
your hands-free the little rock on yeah

658
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,750
you can see because it's constantly

659
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:32,910
flickering hey yeah it wasn't and now it

660
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,670
is on and now I do hear you so hopefully

661
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:38,070
all right why don't we click there's a

662
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,560
slight lag yeah why don't we move back

663
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:43,470
to the beginning of your presentation

664
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:45,000
and I I'm sorry about that I couldn't

665
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,400
get your attention you were on a roll

666
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,849
and I couldn't hear you at all but I'm

667
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,450
gonna I'm gonna stop out and maybe now

668
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:56,759
I'm not hearing you again yep all right

669
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,529
there you go all right hopefully I don't

670
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,940
know why it's cutting out on us we have

671
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,940
had such good luck so far

672
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,809
all right let's see how we're doing now

673
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,490
looks like I'm flickering so let's go

674
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,099
ahead I didn't say anything too terribly

675
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:18,269
important at this point we'll move on to

676
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:19,379
the talk proper alright I'll give a

677
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:21,599
little bit of information about

678
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,520
understanding diseases of brambles and

679
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,809
then I'll talk about brembo root

680
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:30,589
diseases and management and then look at

681
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,940
root diseases in 2009 and some of the

682
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:35,639
issues that seem to be involved with a

683
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,190
small fruit decline this year and what

684
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:41,130
to do about diseases and root decline in

685
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,590
2010 given our seasonal situations of

686
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,930
course this talk is very much here so to

687
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:48,209
the northeastern United States and of

688
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,980
course New York where we've had some

689
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,269
very interesting weather but I I think

690
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,660
some of those situations would also

691
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:56,548
apply to

692
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,250
obviously since we share a lot of the

693
00:31:56,548 --> 00:32:01,250
same overall weather conditions

694
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,319
Oh for

695
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:08,778
section is what are the difficulties

696
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,720
fruit diseases present bramble producers

697
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:13,220
in New York let's look at this sometimes

698
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,069
they can be very frustrating and

699
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,108
established operations the reason why is

700
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:20,479
that the most effective management

701
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:22,158
practices are preventive they occur

702
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,749
prior to planting so if they're getting

703
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,999
them in you're already established

704
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:27,919
planting this becomes a very big

705
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:30,669
headache for producers and even thus

706
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,669
extension people

707
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,350
often times they become apparent after

708
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,059
the planting established you've gone

709
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:45,079
several years and all of a sudden they

710
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:47,159
are beginning to show up three

711
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,689
unfortunately the post planting

712
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,730
management practices when you're in

713
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,650
these situations are less effective and

714
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,650
they seem to only really slow the spread

715
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,220
and unfortunately there is very little

716
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,440
one can do to cure the affected plants

717
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,079
when the problem becomes fairly apparent

718
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,830
to both you and any extension person

719
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,419
coming to visit your site as well but

720
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:11,699
also very frustrating to identifying

721
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,680
diagnose for a lot of the same reasons

722
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,809
unfortunately these pathogens are in our

723
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,390
soil borne protecting and hidden in the

724
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:19,649
soil just as Pam mentioned with viruses

725
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,420
these are things we're not going to be

726
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,580
able to see very well and it's not so

727
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,220
much the fact that they are small or

728
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:28,559
microscopic some of them very much so

729
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,690
are is that they are hidden from view

730
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,879
and we don't see them until they've

731
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:35,400
already gone so far that there is a

732
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,890
point of no return for action in terms

733
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,990
of being a grower also the diagnostic

734
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,030
symptoms are below ground which prevents

735
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,470
recognition during a time when you might

736
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,190
be able to take action to save the

737
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,380
planting and of course once the plan is

738
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,200
dead it becomes a fungal decay

739
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,820
free-for-all preventing you or myself or

740
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,319
any other person visiting your farm from

741
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:55,859
determining what actually you is the

742
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,470
cause

743
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:00,209
so you key is to catch them early but

744
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:05,850
often times it's impossible for you to

745
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:07,920
find them early yeah the one good factor

746
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,809
in all this is that the most common root

747
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,309
diseases affect all berry crops and

748
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,139
their management practices are similar

749
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:15,449
so even if you're not here specifically

750
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,710
for raspberries a lot of the same stuff

751
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,928
we're talking about will apply to all

752
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,970
small fruit diseases or if you have a

753
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,950
diversified planting as I imagine many

754
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:24,539
of you might a lot of what we'll talk

755
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,918
about here will be very applicable in

756
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:29,288
all situations

757
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,480
let's look I'd like to do a little bit

758
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:34,210
of the presentation on winter injury

759
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,980
because in many cases winter injury can

760
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,940
mimic or look like a root disease

761
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:43,088
problem and be responsible for decline

762
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,769
however and brambles winter injury is a

763
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:47,828
little different than in some of the

764
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:49,778
other small fruits what usually occurs

765
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:51,490
is winter injury usually results from

766
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:55,059
spring phrases in March and it usually

767
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:57,429
kills the buds only and it's less so due

768
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,079
to winter temperatures overall being

769
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,078
just a cold temperature you really need

770
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,339
many days of lower than 20 degrees

771
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,809
Fahrenheit before you're actually going

772
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:06,489
to start killing prime Akane's

773
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,440
so for the most part when you see winter

774
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:11,679
injury it may not necessarily be a root

775
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,639
problem but it may in fact look like a

776
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,409
root decline one of the things that I've

777
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,969
read that may cause trouble is if you do

778
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:20,828
a lot of permanent mulching it could

779
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:22,868
delay plant hardening and then there's a

780
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,849
separate winter injury problems but

781
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:27,548
that's not the test this early always be

782
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,019
concerned about of course in the case of

783
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:31,449
winter injury any time a plant becomes

784
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:33,399
stress from disease including root

785
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,618
diseases or other any body at factors

786
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,568
like nutrition your plants is gonna be

787
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:39,970
more predisposed to winter injuries so

788
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:42,159
anytime a plant gets stressed prior to

789
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:44,199
going dormant you've just increased that

790
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,848
chance of actually getting damaged to

791
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:48,250
winter injury in this case that type of

792
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:51,030
damage in the form

793
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:54,550
by McCain damage would be much more

794
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,990
troublesome consequences what will end

795
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,780
up happening is the plant will look

796
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:00,879
produced vigour productivity the four

797
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,950
canes will be the most heavily

798
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,260
influenced they may not they may break

799
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:06,669
but they may begin to wilt and you can

800
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,020
get death but it's very variety of

801
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,000
specific with very little specific

802
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:13,320
information on the varieties that are

803
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,690
most impacted by winter injury

804
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,359
diagnostic symptoms in this case as with

805
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,250
other bramble winter injury symptoms

806
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,409
another small fruit the whole plant may

807
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,869
die but in the case of raspberries and

808
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:27,608
brambles what ends up happening is the

809
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,140
temperatures warm before canes will

810
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:32,348
appear to be wilt while the prima canes

811
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:34,719
remain healthy why this is is that the

812
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,309
buds on the Prima canes are seemed to be

813
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,439
the most affected by the winter injury

814
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:40,779
so when they burst into flora canes

815
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,630
they'll begin to wilt due to damaged

816
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,400
vascular connections so what one can see

817
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,910
in these very small pictures one for my

818
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,910
own stuff

819
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,420
very diagnostic keys that you'll see a

820
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:57,308
lot of the newer flora canes looking for

821
00:36:52,420 --> 00:37:00,579
rather weakened and injured while the

822
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:02,019
prima canes themselves look fairly good

823
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:04,210
let's see if I can change the color to

824
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:07,598
something

825
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,250
see that they are dying at the tips and

826
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,510
all along that row while the prime

827
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:16,858
mccain's themselves look quite fine

828
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,859
let's skip over to slide pains

829
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,159
to the ground but like I spend before

830
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,030
broads or the primary source of affected

831
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,719
material when it comes to winter injury

832
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,650
but don't let it completely confuse you

833
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,629
one thing that is interesting about

834
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,550
winter injury is that somewhat

835
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,349
diagnostic the plants will continue or

836
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,150
send up new promo canes that stay

837
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:37,710
healthy however if your plants are

838
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,690
actually suffering from a root disease

839
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,550
the plants will continue declining

840
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,110
throughout the season as will be more

841
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,260
evident when we get right down into the

842
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:48,390
diseases themselves let's look at one

843
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,120
here Phytophthora root rot one of the

844
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:54,659
more prevalent diseases in small fruit

845
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,460
and that for brambles as well it's a

846
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,679
chronic pathogen which means it

847
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,869
basically lives as an underwater

848
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:03,119
organism it when it's dried out it's

849
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:05,190
simply just surviving that's why it

850
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,779
likes wet soils and low-lying areas

851
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,519
these things are all very familiar with

852
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,890
one of the other interesting features of

853
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:14,429
Phytophthora is that it prefers cool

854
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:16,650
temperatures and cool weather which can

855
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:19,139
be a problem if we have cool springs and

856
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,289
cool summers let's look at the symptom

857
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:25,139
so what will happen is you'll get some

858
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:26,820
stunting and chlorosis at the end to see

859
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,059
the chlorosis here of course it didn't

860
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,500
draw anything ah there it goes some of

861
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:34,349
the chlorosis just simply meaning a

862
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,679
yellow spot and of course wilt and death

863
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:39,449
of plants in patches as the soil begins

864
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:43,519
to warm you can see there's a nice patch

865
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:43,519
of really wilting and dying plants

866
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:51,108
so in order to diagnose a raspberry

867
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,210
let's say you're seeing Wilton death and

868
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:54,739
patches and you're planting you want to

869
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,568
see whether or not it's Phytophthora or

870
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:58,368
or something completely different

871
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,050
take the wilting plant don't pick a dead

872
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,579
one like I said once they're dead it

873
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,720
becomes a fungal free-for-all and you

874
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,269
may not be able to tell what's actually

875
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:08,059
happening dig it up remove the soil from

876
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:09,289
the root system if you have four Toffler

877
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,449
you'll notice that many of the fine

878
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:13,460
roots and lateral roots will have rotted

879
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,879
away it won't be a nice you won't have

880
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,170
all the nice bushy fine root material

881
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,930
cut through the crown in the large roots

882
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,300
now what you'll see if it's completely

883
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:25,269
white underneath you know you're you're

884
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,130
gonna be fine like this piece here

885
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:31,550
however if you begin to see a reddish

886
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:35,240
chocolate brown pick portion with a

887
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:37,730
sharply delineated white area you will

888
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,019
begin to note that that is very suspect

889
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,000
to Phytophthora you'll get these

890
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:44,889
chocolate red brown sections but it'll

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,329
be sharply delineated with a white a

892
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:49,068
slightly white section like right there

893
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,990
at that margin so that's very indicative

894
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:53,088
of Phytophthora in that case you might

895
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,949
suspect that you're planting had a fight

896
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,108
off the problem and that those patches

897
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:59,809
of dying plants was indeed due to that

898
00:39:57,108 --> 00:40:01,279
of course wet spots and low-lying areas

899
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:05,659
are also going to be dead giveaways as

900
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,430
well or suggestions one thing to

901
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:09,170
consider is that once your plant gets

902
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:11,000
killed by Phytophthora all the

903
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,409
Phytophthora infected propagules are

904
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,630
going to hang out in that dead tissue

905
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:17,868
and some of them will get into the soil

906
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,000
and remain dormant until you have those

907
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:21,800
temperatures of cool weather and water

908
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,230
and will cause infections in later

909
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,660
seasons so if you had was planting that

910
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:28,818
was killed or destroyed by Phytophthora

911
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:31,129
and then you remove the plants bear in

912
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:32,719
mind that those pools are still going to

913
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,660
be waiting for you the next time you

914
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:39,078
replant and they can last for quite some

915
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:41,358
time unfortunately management um

916
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,599
obviously select a site with a rail

917
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,009
train soil use raised beds if possible

918
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,539
this isn't something I always see in

919
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,099
raspberry production but if it was

920
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,670
possible it would be something that

921
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,588
would help

922
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,829
and obviously since it's on aquatic

923
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:57,440
pathogen as much irrigation artificial

924
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:59,119
as you can avoid would be great so if

925
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,400
you could minimize the water that is the

926
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,530
key to managing fatah flora root rot at

927
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,059
least culturally of course select an

928
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,890
appropriate variety there are

929
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,470
differences in resistance among

930
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:11,328
raspberry varieties however they are not

931
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:13,818
often well known in the movie best serve

932
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:15,740
by looking in your nursery catalog for

933
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:17,259
which varieties claimed to have some

934
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,328
form of resistance

935
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,309
well larger somaye newt it may be and

936
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:23,930
picking one like that if you think you

937
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:26,960
have a planting with a lot of low-lying

938
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:30,558
spots and potential wet spots or a field

939
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,358
that's historically more wet chemical

940
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,390
there are things you can do chemically

941
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:37,848
to manage Phytophthora however these are

942
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:39,739
only gonna work with good cultural

943
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:41,390
management practices if you're trying to

944
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,828
grow these things hydroponically it

945
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:45,108
won't matter how much fungicide you

946
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:48,349
spray Phytophthora if it's present will

947
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:50,058
be will still overwhelm the system one

948
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:51,769
of the materials is called methane oxen

949
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:53,930
it's called red mole gold usually

950
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:56,088
involves an autumn soil application

951
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:58,250
however there is a strong propensity for

952
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:01,608
fungicide resistance development to this

953
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,989
however there are some newer softer

954
00:42:01,608 --> 00:42:05,779
materials that are actually very

955
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:07,639
effective against by tatra a Liette pro

956
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,440
fight foster all these are phosphorous

957
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,838
acid biopesticides

958
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,119
and these you can apply an early spring

959
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:17,269
in late summer to the foliage and they

960
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:21,260
do do a good job as an example there

961
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:22,759
were used for a while to manage sudden

962
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,160
oak death in California with aerial

963
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,200
applications and fairly effectively so

964
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:30,348
these are actually a good alternative to

965
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,899
the hard core fungicide if you have a

966
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,240
photographer problem now I'd like to

967
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,030
change gears and move to the next

968
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,669
disease that one can find in brambles in

969
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,710
our region verticillium wilt

970
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,630
it's a vascular disease meaning that it

971
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,460
ruins the vascular tissue and is going

972
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,769
to end up causing a wilt whenever the

973
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,449
vascular tissue is in hampered you can

974
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:52,670
expect that plants will begin the wilt

975
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:55,000
it's a pathogen on many hosts including

976
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,440
a lot of weeds and vegetables

977
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,599
fortunately it's the black raspberries

978
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,510
that are usually most heavily impacted

979
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,010
by

980
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,690
disease and according to a lot of

981
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,430
literature I've seen the red and the

982
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,829
purple appear as a whole to be less

983
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:09,210
susceptible to the problem but I would

984
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:12,619
not exclude them from having the

985
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,619
possibility of getting the disease

986
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,759
um the fortunate thing is this has some

987
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,710
ground symptoms and stuff to look for

988
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,930
this one is easy to identify and not

989
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,510
only brambles but other small fruit

990
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:30,399
crops as well and of course it when it

991
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,049
disrupts vascular function it's kind of

992
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,108
like not giving the plant enough water

993
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:38,429
it will be stunted wilt and you can kill

994
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:40,659
or verticillium can kill the plant

995
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:42,219
symptoms and diagnosis what will end up

996
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,338
happening first is the young canes oh

997
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:47,169
well first from the base to the tips

998
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:48,909
petioles will remain attached and the

999
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,500
older leaves will look scorched you can

1000
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:52,118
see some of the older leaves down here

1001
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,568
at the base of this cane in particular

1002
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,099
they are sort of crispy torn up and

1003
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:59,710
messed up however some of the younger

1004
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:02,410
leaves at the top are you can still see

1005
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:05,019
our green so that's one thing to look

1006
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:08,409
for of course there's a more severe

1007
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:10,088
situation where everything is scorched

1008
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:12,219
at the bottom all the older leaves are

1009
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:15,308
pretty much ruined they almost look

1010
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:17,798
burnt one thing that you can also find

1011
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,900
in cases of severely infected canes

1012
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:21,670
you'll see blueish spots you might

1013
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,039
notice that this spot is a little pale

1014
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,619
brown or something like that but this

1015
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,719
area here is a little more blue these

1016
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:30,700
bluish indications may be an indication

1017
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,259
of verticillium infection this isn't

1018
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:34,179
necessarily the best picture of it and

1019
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,700
unfortunately black raspberries have

1020
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:39,190
bluish cast to their cane which makes it

1021
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:44,108
kind of tricky but look for spots and

1022
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:45,789
there are better pictures not very few

1023
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:47,318
on the internet show this situation very

1024
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:49,719
carefully yeah I've got better in

1025
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:53,858
strawberry but this can be something to

1026
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,719
look for management what can you do

1027
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,449
about verticillium wilt unfortunately

1028
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,789
this is a difficult one the pathogen can

1029
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:02,348
survive in soils after weeds and

1030
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:04,119
vegetables for many years it makes a

1031
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:06,548
resistant structure called a sclerotia

1032
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:09,640
and can hide out in the soil waiting for

1033
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:11,679
you to plant after purchasing a tomato a

1034
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,519
field planet - tomato eggplant peppers

1035
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,368
whatever

1036
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:17,230
if you plant after many of these hosts

1037
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:19,269
there is a possibility that you could

1038
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,889
get verticillium wilt of course it may

1039
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:23,139
not always be practical to wait three

1040
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:26,089
years but it is something to consider if

1041
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:27,500
you have a planting declining and it was

1042
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,890
after one of these things putting things

1043
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,900
like stone fruit trees which are rather

1044
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:35,000
strange but may be present in a

1045
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,030
diversified farm in the region so

1046
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,829
something to watch out for as Pam

1047
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,630
mentioned on many instances it's very

1048
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:43,849
important to use verticillium free

1049
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,530
planting stock if your planting stock

1050
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:47,690
has the little blue splotches throughout

1051
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,340
on your black raspberries it's maybe you

1052
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,769
not want to use that one ever consider

1053
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:53,360
that there could be a problem with it

1054
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:54,889
before planting it

1055
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,349
unfortunately there's no complete

1056
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:59,480
resistance not like flat-out immunity as

1057
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:00,710
I mentioned earlier the red and purple

1058
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,510
raspberries appear to be less

1059
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,099
susceptible to disease so if you're

1060
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,310
coming in after one of these other crops

1061
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:10,730
you may want to consider a red or a

1062
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:12,980
purple raspberry variety you can

1063
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,050
fumigate but fumigation has become

1064
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:21,070
impractical in recent years due to cost

1065
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:23,210
and many of the legislation legislative

1066
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,309
guidelines under which it must occur

1067
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,900
it's not something that's done that

1068
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:28,610
often and it's something I believe that

1069
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,590
we should get away for environment away

1070
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,590
from doing for environmental concerns

1071
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,739
let's hook briefly about krungel it's

1072
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,099
one of the other diseases that one may

1073
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:40,099
find

1074
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:45,608
it's a vascular tumor disease so

1075
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,159
basically what's happening in this case

1076
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:50,318
is a soil borne bacterial pathogen is

1077
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,449
causing tumor like growths on a root

1078
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,460
system again it will disrupt the

1079
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:55,449
vascular function causing the plants to

1080
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,579
appear to wilt

1081
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:59,608
can I get stunting wilting they're not

1082
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:01,690
going to be as productive and

1083
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,608
unfortunately if you get one of these it

1084
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,950
will predispose you for a winter injury

1085
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:08,528
because the things occur at the crown

1086
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:09,998
and the type of winter injury occurring

1087
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:13,568
at the crown is not something that one

1088
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:15,608
wishes to have fortunately these are

1089
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:17,349
very early sometimes fairly easy to find

1090
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:18,969
if they actually occur at the crown

1091
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:21,220
here's two pictures from the very

1092
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,629
diagnostic key in order to find or

1093
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:25,088
determine whether you have this problem

1094
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:27,400
look at the base of the Canes and crowns

1095
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:29,858
if you and of course dig up a root

1096
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,539
system if you don't see anything but

1097
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:33,699
what will happen is on the lower crowns

1098
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:37,900
and stems and roots won't find these

1099
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:39,998
tumor like growths highlight that one

1100
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,039
it's kind of a dark color they

1101
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:46,899
eventually will get old and the bacteria

1102
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:48,369
will be released as they decay and enter

1103
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,200
into the soil again which causes

1104
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,640
problems so in these instances there are

1105
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,469
your little tumor like growths and of

1106
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:59,308
course that's the the cause of the

1107
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:59,308
problem yes as I mentioned before

1108
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:03,110
they will disintegrate sometimes after

1109
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,369
they are formed over the course of

1110
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,980
heading into dormancy and they release

1111
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:09,599
the bacteria into the soil another thing

1112
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,070
to keep in mind is this is a common

1113
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,679
disease problem in stone fruit and

1114
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:15,840
especially grapes in this region crown

1115
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,419
gall and in grapes is fairly prevalent

1116
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,010
and if you're planting in land after one

1117
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,750
of these two situations there's always a

1118
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,720
possibility that you could be planting

1119
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,550
in the soils that have this bacteria

1120
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:29,819
it's management obviously if you see

1121
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:31,680
planting stock with goals or odd growths

1122
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,670
on the roots or crowns don't don't use

1123
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,469
it by all means also take care after

1124
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:39,389
planting after stone for another grapes

1125
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:41,730
if you're finding old root systems with

1126
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:44,489
galls and bumps on it you might want to

1127
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,500
consider planting somewhere else most

1128
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:48,599
importantly avoid practices that injure

1129
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,940
the crown and roots so what this

1130
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,369
bacterium does is it's in the soil in

1131
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,349
any injury near the crown and roots that

1132
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:57,480
occurs in contact with the soil and if

1133
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,190
the bacterium was present can be the

1134
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,750
site of the gall formation

1135
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,869
hence in that one picture we showed a

1136
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,820
while back the raspberry crown there was

1137
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:08,250
probably some sort of injury that caused

1138
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:12,059
the bacteria to infect and begin it's

1139
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:14,309
tumors as the opposite situation is

1140
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:18,420
possible even winter injury and insects

1141
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:21,179
can wound sufficiently to cause an

1142
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,200
infection for the bacterium so even a

1143
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:24,149
little bit of wind your injury and

1144
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,639
insect pressure if it's too high can

1145
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:30,110
predispose you to this disease if you

1146
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,109
have soil with the bacterium

1147
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,720
unfortunately with crown gall there's

1148
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,079
not much you can do chemically so you

1149
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,699
just have to be very careful and how you

1150
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,369
set up your plantings and the planting

1151
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:43,288
stock you use so at this point I'd like

1152
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:45,990
to quickly talk a little bit about root

1153
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:49,009
diseases 2009 or some of the things that

1154
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:51,629
we had run into or possible problems

1155
00:49:49,009 --> 00:49:53,248
questions being is what role did root

1156
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,318
diseases playing plant decline in the

1157
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:57,889
2009 season it didn't look like many of

1158
00:49:55,318 --> 00:50:00,088
you experienced this thank goodness but

1159
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:01,889
there was a lot of it at diversified

1160
00:50:00,088 --> 00:50:06,179
planting so I thought it pertinent to

1161
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:07,739
address and what can we do to prepare

1162
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:11,210
for root diseases and plant decline in

1163
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:13,828
2007 do they commonly index for crown

1164
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,929
crown gall and small fruit nurseries I

1165
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:18,119
have no idea I think it's a fairly rare

1166
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:21,558
disease and you don't see it that much

1167
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:24,588
however I think that any nursery that

1168
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:27,180
saw the diagnostic symptoms of it

1169
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:30,869
wouldn't grow it it's in the soil much

1170
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:32,518
less so in the plants and so the plants

1171
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:33,960
would likely be clean unless they were

1172
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:35,998
bringing him out of contaminated soil

1173
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,699
and I imagine that they would spot and

1174
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:40,798
not not even sell it so I don't know if

1175
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:43,169
they specifically do it but I imagine by

1176
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:46,400
just a common quality practices they

1177
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,400
would see it and remove it

1178
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,470
2009 um I got a lot of reports of small

1179
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,260
fruit decline especially in strawberries

1180
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:56,538
but summon brambles and/or raspberries

1181
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,528
as well

1182
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:01,170
unfortunately these all's happened in

1183
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:03,179
the late season and in many cases

1184
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,298
decline progressed to a point where it

1185
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:08,940
was difficult to confirm root disease

1186
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:10,949
however we did find several indications

1187
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,559
of verticillium wilt and fight author

1188
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:15,689
and of course winter injury so that was

1189
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,910
somewhat surprising in the last three

1190
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:21,150
years of my appointment when you've seen

1191
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:24,960
very few instances of this in 2009 was

1192
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:27,720
especially a bad year for becoming aware

1193
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,048
of these problems obviously the spring

1194
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:33,659
was fairly dry and cool not not too

1195
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:36,389
unusual however the June July months was

1196
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:38,098
really wet a lot of rain many inches of

1197
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:40,528
rainfall and the temperatures were cool

1198
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,539
as I've noted for monitoring weather for

1199
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:44,369
other diseases it was an extremely cold

1200
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:47,069
summer and many of you probably realized

1201
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:49,470
this as well if you have cold conditions

1202
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:51,449
and a lot of water it might have made a

1203
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:54,209
very favorable situation for

1204
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:56,689
Phytophthora and it may be that in many

1205
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,690
cases

1206
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:03,059
um yes according I'll maybe I'll answer

1207
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,619
that question later almost done um in

1208
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,590
many instances if you have cool

1209
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,849
conditions and wetter a lot of wetness

1210
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,880
you will run into problems with

1211
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:15,989
Phytophthora and this may explain what

1212
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,269
we've had happen so what can we do to

1213
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:21,000
prepare the conditions were very

1214
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:22,349
favorable for root disease in 2009 there

1215
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,179
could be a lot of high levels of

1216
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:27,179
inoculum even if you didn't have any

1217
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:29,279
root disease decline last year the

1218
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:31,109
situation may be prepped for having

1219
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,180
enough inoculum such that if the

1220
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:37,320
conditions exist you could get a root

1221
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:40,649
disease problem if you thought you had

1222
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:43,230
decline in 2009 or had a lot of wet

1223
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,910
spots or maybe some unthrifty plants and

1224
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,590
it was in a wet spot some of those

1225
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:47,940
situations that would be conducive for

1226
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,530
Phytophthora you may want to consider

1227
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,510
putting on a spring application of a

1228
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:53,340
phosphorous acid product as a

1229
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,500
preventative measure for managing

1230
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,170
Phytophthora and potentially affected

1231
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:01,079
fields if you get a head start on it you

1232
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,789
will be able to potentially manage it if

1233
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,860
the disease begins to show up later in

1234
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:06,750
the season and you can finally see it

1235
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,340
without digging it up it's usually too

1236
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,710
late to do anything about it so this

1237
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:13,860
year may be pertinent to use a

1238
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:16,369
preventative application of a Fozzy acid

1239
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:19,559
product if you're have fields in which

1240
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:23,429
would or could develop life at our

1241
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:26,279
problem low-lying wet fields and oral

1242
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:28,079
fields with a lot of wet spots and you

1243
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,500
went through last 2009 even without a

1244
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:34,110
problem um also there could be increased

1245
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,389
winter injury in 2010 even if your

1246
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:38,460
raspberries had a lot of foliar diseases

1247
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:40,349
towards the end of the season you know

1248
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,300
even things like leaf spots of rust and

1249
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:43,980
a little bit of anthracnose this may

1250
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,500
have predisposed you for winter injury

1251
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,150
as you enter dormancy what you want to

1252
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,489
do is make sure that your plantings are

1253
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:52,289
well insulated in in the spring Scout

1254
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:54,509
frequently fir the signs of declining

1255
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:55,469
plants you could use this handout to

1256
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,750
determine whether or not you have a

1257
00:53:55,469 --> 00:54:00,209
winter injury issue or potentially a

1258
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,829
root disease problem if you can

1259
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:03,278
recognize the cause of this early you

1260
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:05,108
can take action

1261
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:06,338
to get rid of the losses I mean many of

1262
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,498
the diseases you can't do much about

1263
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:10,028
such as verticillium and crown gall but

1264
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:12,278
these are less likely to have simply

1265
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:13,659
emerged over the course of two ceases

1266
00:54:12,278 --> 00:54:17,068
what this would allow you to get a

1267
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:17,068
handle on things such as fight off

1268
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:24,309
alright looks like we already have a

1269
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:27,579
question if a prime McCain is mowed down

1270
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:29,199
and the winter and the Canes get broken

1271
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:31,269
by the mower will this increase

1272
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,309
susceptibility crown gall I would I

1273
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:35,500
would imagine so if the bacterium is

1274
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:37,989
present in the soil mowing would be an

1275
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,119
excellent way to injure your canes to

1276
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:42,429
provide a source of infection for the

1277
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,600
crown ball bacterium however if you been

1278
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:46,389
mowing for many years and have never

1279
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,809
seen it then it is likely the crown gall

1280
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:53,199
bacterium is not in your soil other

1281
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:55,980
question Carrick I was wondering if you

1282
00:54:53,199 --> 00:55:00,699
had any opinion about actinovate as a

1283
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:02,679
preventive approach to verticillium I've

1284
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:06,039
used actinovate and other cropping

1285
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:10,239
systems particularly on tree fruit and

1286
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:12,610
haven't had any I haven't had a

1287
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,500
considerable measurable success in

1288
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:19,840
getting it to manage diseases that are

1289
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:25,210
also fungi um I don't know I I'm very

1290
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:28,869
hesitant to recommend any fungicide use

1291
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:30,670
for verticillium wilt because usually

1292
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:32,590
the pathogens in the soil and the

1293
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,960
actinovate is bringing on the foliage I

1294
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:38,200
mean you could in theory drench it if it

1295
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,170
isn't co-ordinates with a label but I

1296
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:42,819
imagine the you know getting it through

1297
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,930
the soil to the plant to the site where

1298
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:49,480
the verticillium would be is is kind of

1299
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:53,230
a stretch with any fungicide including a

1300
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,780
actinovate which is a soft product oh

1301
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:57,099
the motive acts like a no let's see if

1302
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,960
some of these others came Phytophthora

1303
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:01,719
root rot kill a plant within one season

1304
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,389
I would imagine if it got going you

1305
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,339
could lose an entire plant it will look

1306
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:10,239
wilted on Thrifty it may or may not die

1307
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:12,280
depends on how robust your planting is

1308
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,259
if it's a long established planting it

1309
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,580
may be able to outlast it however the

1310
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,180
fight off ler is going to be there

1311
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:22,219
waiting for it next season mode of

1312
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:23,809
action yeah no I was just trying to yeah

1313
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:26,868
the motive action of the phosphorous

1314
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:28,639
acid products motive action for the

1315
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:30,650
phosphorous acid products involves the

1316
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,799
phosphide ion is actually directly

1317
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:35,990
lethal to the Phytophthora pathogen now

1318
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,420
there's been a lot of work to look at

1319
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:40,219
the phosphorous acid the phosphite ions

1320
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,579
effect on other fungi it doesn't appear

1321
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:45,108
to have a strong of effect the the

1322
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:48,108
Phytophthora is not actually a fungus

1323
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:49,670
it is a aquatic organism in an entirely

1324
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:51,619
different Kingdom when it seems to be

1325
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:53,720
very susceptible to the phosphide Island

1326
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:56,000
now a product like a Liette has to go

1327
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:58,639
through several breakdown steps in the

1328
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,289
soil while the newer phosphorous acid

1329
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:03,289
products can kind of skip the middleman

1330
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:05,539
of breakdown and go straight through the

1331
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:07,219
ion in the ion becoming available it

1332
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:09,710
seems to be what damages the

1333
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:11,899
Phytophthora okay Tom Stephenson has a

1334
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:17,659
question about whether or not nurseries

1335
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:19,880
commonly index for crown gall I imagine

1336
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:22,879
that's something that they're aware of

1337
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,460
and would see but I don't know if they

1338
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,829
specifically have an indexing program

1339
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,690
for it I imagine it would be something

1340
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:32,630
that would show up as a catch-all I mean

1341
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:34,309
it's very obvious I doubt they would

1342
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:36,260
think oh no my raspberry has

1343
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:38,269
nitrogen-fixing root nodules that's

1344
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,980
probably fine I imagine that's something

1345
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:42,769
that would flag very easily in a

1346
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,750
quality-control situation and it's

1347
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:46,579
mostly in the soil not necess you know

1348
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,599
it can get in the plants but I mentioned

1349
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:51,858
they're growing their plants and very

1350
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:53,660
clean soil so it's unless it was really

1351
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:56,029
sloppy operation I imagine they would

1352
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:57,559
catch that but I don't know of any they

1353
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:00,440
have a specific crown crown gall

1354
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:03,799
indexing program okay and then Alan

1355
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,630
Baker has a question about fall red

1356
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,730
raspberries that bloomed and set fruit

1357
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:10,369
buds but in mid-october at a killing

1358
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:12,409
freeze and do you have any idea if that

1359
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:16,880
will have any effect on the seasons

1360
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:18,440
production um well if the buds here

1361
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,420
I don't know that's that's a good

1362
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,980
question it may if Marvin

1363
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,750
so I guess Marvin's microphones and

1364
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,990
probably not on but

1365
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:29,420
I don't know I mean that was Alan those

1366
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:34,129
must be like a heritage a pre McCain

1367
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:36,079
berry right I mean a killing freezes is

1368
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:43,369
not good but I think the quick now

1369
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:45,199
here's the parasitizing okay yeah should

1370
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:48,670
see we think I would have yes guys hard

1371
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,669
to say should be a prosecution

1372
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:56,289
setbacks are separation of crops if it's

1373
00:58:53,059 --> 00:59:00,320
a mixed vegetable and very farm

1374
00:58:56,289 --> 00:59:02,509
uh-huh yeah I would keep my obviously

1375
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,420
the peppers seem to be the the poster

1376
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:06,859
child for verticillium well and III

1377
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,849
think if as long as you don't plant them

1378
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:12,289
immediately after peppers or any of

1379
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:14,359
those other events or tomato I think

1380
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,469
you're probably be fine in terms of

1381
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:16,909
worrying about them now I ever

1382
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,219
Phytophthora can getting all those as

1383
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:21,799
well if you have my frittata problem in

1384
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:25,250
a field then you're planning next to it

1385
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,359
with your raspberries that could be an

1386
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,858
issue which you'd want to do is make

1387
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:30,650
sure that water doesn't drain from the

1388
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:33,319
infected field to the field of your

1389
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:36,650
raspberries a water will carry the

1390
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,410
Phytophthora so in that case that would

1391
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,880
be the if you can separate them by water

1392
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,670
source you can eliminate a lot of the

1393
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,809
disease problems or if you don't plant

1394
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,030
in the same area where you've had a

1395
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:49,279
problem in a vegetable plant it and we

1396
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:52,609
usually recommend like a three year

1397
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,650
rotational separation using you know an

1398
00:59:52,608 --> 00:59:57,469
unrelated crops or a cover crop or

1399
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:59,260
something is that that isn't that isn't

1400
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:01,639
the blood is on the verticillium

1401
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,230
recommends for a many places yes

1402
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:07,460
don't wait three years even after stones

1403
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:09,230
root and certain weed crops if you have

1404
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,409
a heavy weed infestation it can carry

1405
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:13,960
verticillium as well like pigweed horse

1406
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,250
nettle some of those others

1407
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:21,460
them isn't there so there's a couple

1408
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:23,170
more yeah he book typing in thanks poke

1409
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,358
over again how much is too much well

1410
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:27,369
well if you're starting to see flooding

1411
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:28,509
or if you can pick up the soil and

1412
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:31,119
you're getting a lot of moisture on your

1413
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:32,950
hands and that may be too much however

1414
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:38,700
if your plants are wilting from drought

1415
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:38,699
you need to irrigate them testing former

1416
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:48,260
carick did we lose you know I'm here I'm

1417
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,300
just looking at Jeff's question should

1418
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:55,280
we test pond waters used for irrigation

1419
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:57,800
for fight ah throw uh I I don't know if

1420
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,490
anyone does that necessarily I don't

1421
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:03,500
know if you'll you'll see it in there so

1422
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:05,119
much unless you have a problem with

1423
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,010
fight off that other areas in your

1424
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,960
operation I don't think it would

1425
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,570
necessarily be a good use of your time

1426
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,039
necessarily to try to test that way the

1427
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:15,230
best use of time would be to see

1428
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:18,050
declining plants and quickly pull them

1429
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:19,639
up look and see if there's a problem or

1430
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:21,740
take a healthy plant that's near your

1431
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,769
irrigation and make sure it doesn't have

1432
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:29,329
those nice chocolate areas would do any

1433
01:01:24,769 --> 01:01:34,820
aid up against white tissue use it extra

1434
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:37,130
plant is an indicator if as you folks

1435
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:39,050
think of a couple more questions for dr.

1436
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:42,920
Cox and Thank You Carrick so much that

1437
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:45,110
was a great presentation and it but

1438
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,240
please there's a little bit more time

1439
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:49,730
that if you do think of some questions

1440
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:53,119
let's let's lay them out there I have a

1441
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:57,730
couple of more poll questions that I'd

1442
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,730
like to introduce just quickly

1443
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:08,829
and I'm gonna open it up and ask

1444
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,659
everybody to please vote there's thirty

1445
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:14,829
four of us logged on and if you're a

1446
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:17,288
grower I'd love it if you could to join

1447
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:19,509
us and armed with the handout of this

1448
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:25,390
presentation knowledge of my own

1449
01:02:19,509 --> 01:02:28,119
operation and abundant free time I yeah

1450
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:29,618
that's right you could just could

1451
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,999
probably determine the cause of a

1452
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:33,329
bramble decline could definitely

1453
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:35,618
determine the cause and of decline

1454
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:38,410
probably couldn't determine the cause

1455
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:41,019
and still couldn't identify the cause

1456
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:45,248
nor what to do about it we'd love to get

1457
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:48,939
some feedback from you and that handout

1458
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:53,189
that dr. Cox mentioned is available you

1459
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:55,869
can download it on to your computer and

1460
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:57,700
we'll give folks a little bit of time we

1461
01:02:55,869 --> 01:03:00,880
I think we had about twenty growers or

1462
01:02:57,699 --> 01:03:04,710
22 growers that were present I'd love to

1463
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,710
see that many folks voting

1464
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:17,629
and Pam Fisher is still with us so if

1465
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:20,960
anybody has any virus questions please

1466
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:25,849
type those in we can address them now as

1467
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:32,179
well got about 17 people a couple more

1468
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:34,720
folks maybe if they could vote I guess

1469
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:40,669
not so I'm going to close this poll and

1470
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:46,868
then I have one other hold on I just get

1471
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:46,869
a locked in here

1472
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:53,679
one other pod to pull pull to ask you

1473
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:03,220
and hopefully people can see this I'll

1474
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:06,200
try to make it bigger

1475
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:08,779
we'll see if people thought this was

1476
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:10,639
helpful to the manda management the

1477
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:15,010
presentation helpful to your management

1478
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,009
of bramble viruses on your farm

1479
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:24,530
and if we could get about 17 or 18

1480
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,530
people to vote that would be great

1481
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:36,719
wonderful thank you guys very much for

1482
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:39,098
participating in this I want to thank

1483
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:42,848
unless open there might be somebody else

1484
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:44,980
oh there is another question for Pam why

1485
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:47,970
is puckering of leaves more associated

1486
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:51,039
with viruses versus other disease

1487
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:53,289
diseases Pam or possibly even Carrick

1488
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,619
maybe you guys could weigh in on that

1489
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,619
question

1490
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:09,670
they're thinking well go ahead Pam if

1491
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:11,349
you want I I mean it's probably killing

1492
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,119
some of the faster growing cells some

1493
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:14,889
cells remain growing while the younger

1494
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,460
ones are being killed off and causes

1495
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:19,839
they miss shapen development on Aries

1496
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,179
and the leaves I mean that's what

1497
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,100
viruses do they kill cells so maybe

1498
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:24,759
somewhere more impact another Pam he

1499
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:30,960
have an idea

1500
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:30,960
I don't know we're not hearing her

1501
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:39,778
Bunge I rot things so they don't

1502
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:44,039
necessarily cause stunted individual

1503
01:05:39,778 --> 01:05:47,110
cell growth hope something's happening

1504
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:50,619
yeah that was me sorry I didn't have my

1505
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:52,630
mic on yeah I think if you're trying to

1506
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:54,309
compare them to leaf diseases then there

1507
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:56,530
are things that cause puckering like

1508
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:58,539
cold temperature damage or mechanical

1509
01:05:56,530 --> 01:06:00,780
damage that just makes the leaf grow

1510
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:03,759
more quickly in some parts than others

1511
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,530
but of the other fungal diseases that

1512
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,370
attack raspberries I don't think they

1513
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,920
work that way

1514
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:10,569
alright that was like those are great

1515
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:15,130
answers to that question I was a little

1516
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:17,050
trickier but I want to encourage if you

1517
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:18,789
do have any other questions now's the

1518
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:21,220
time I'm going to draw your attention

1519
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:23,860
one more time to these handouts that you

1520
01:06:21,219 --> 01:06:26,529
can upload onto your own computer in the

1521
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:29,800
file share box and I think this

1522
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:31,540
concludes our ramble disease management

1523
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:36,010
webinar but I want to draw your

1524
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:38,529
attention to our final bramble and the

1525
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,570
entire Cornell berry Series berry

1526
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:43,750
webinar series will be held on Wednesday

1527
