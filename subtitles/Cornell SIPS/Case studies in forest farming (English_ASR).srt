1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,638
University thank you

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,079
Don it's uh good to see you this

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,719
afternoon um now Don just mentioned the

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,278
fact that I teach a couple of courses

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,960
including one called practicum en Forest

7
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,160
farming it's unusual I think it's a

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,439
unique course at least in the sense that

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,518
it's taught almost entirely Outdoors at

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,359
the McDaniels nutgrove

11
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,679
uh the pictures here are shots from the

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,640
McDaniels nut grve uh some of the

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,878
students that we've taught there over

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,079
the last 12 years and this fellow is

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:47,320
Lawrence McDaniels whose house Dawn now

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,160
lives in and oh youed too I didn't know

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,238
you moved anyway um Dr Mack established

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,479
the well came to cornal in the 1920s and

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,558
uh after he um cut down all the trees on

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,640
this particular site on the south Edge

21
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,959
ofing campus um he started planting nut

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,118
trees and even though his responsibility

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,639
was primarily uh pomology apples and so

24
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:13,959
forth he was really uh dedicated to uh

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,478
temperate nut trees and he and a few

26
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:22,039
others in this country like um J.R Smith

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,000
believed that U nut trees could become a

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,600
very important source of food for

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,078
livestock as well as people on steep

30
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,478
hillsides um it was was a good idea as

31
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,359
the uh Depression was approaching but as

32
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,078
things turned out it didn't really uh

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,200
take off like they thought it might

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,919
because of advances in modern

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,000
agriculture I think um but so it was a

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,399
variety trial as I say for temperate nut

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,319
trees uh walnuts hickories and so forth

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,759
this was a clonal collection so it was a

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,359
clonal repository and I think he learned

40
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,000
a lot uh about the trees and how they

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,718
perform and uh how efficiently they

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,239
could be grafted onto various rootstocks

43
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:07,519
and so forth um Dr Mack retired in the

44
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:11,479
mid 1950s and it was about that time uh

45
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,639
when he um was sort of phasing out his

46
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,878
involvement in the in the McDaniels n

47
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:23,119
growth and uh

48
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:26,399
he was was um material in in

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
um in letting letting go of that and and

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,360
turning on to other Pursuits but in the

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,439
meantime since then

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,879
the site sort of reverted to uh

53
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,039
secondary forest and we rediscovered it

54
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,518
uh overgrown with all sorts of invasives

55
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,519
and everything else in about 2002 and

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,360
ever since then we've been developing it

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,640
as a um outdoor teaching site for Forest

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
farming um couple hundred of students

59
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,598
have passed through and it's the

60
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,039
students who have contributed a great

61
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,039
deal of what you will see on the ground

62
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,878
there

63
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,598
now um so at any rate I and uh Steve

64
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,518
Gabriel uh who also helps me teach the

65
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,598
course we spent a lot of time there and

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,759
to some extent it was McDaniels nutgrove

67
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,119
that inspired me uh to to write this

68
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,000
book along with

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,158
Steve there we go that's the book um

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,479
that's Steve Gabriel I'm not here to

71
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,439
sell your books today uh but I would

72
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,079
like to talk about some of the some of

73
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,479
the things that we bring up in the book

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,200
that I think are important opportunities

75
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,199
for people who have uh small wood lots

76
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,039
and so forth now let me tell you what

77
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,639
Forest farming is Forest farming is one

78
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,120
of a number of different um AGR forestry

79
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,158
practices uh Forest farming the one

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,039
that's uh penultimate in my mind but

81
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:49,479
also alley cropping reparan buffers wind

82
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,798
breaks silver pasture those are supposed

83
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,919
to be cows down there and uh Forest

84
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,879
gardening which is distinctly different

85
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,559
from forest farming you can Define

86
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,518
forest farming as uh well the simplest

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,438
definition this is an elegant def

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,480
definition by Jean Grace my graduate

89
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:09,120
student under the unique microclimate

90
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,359
created by the forest canopy but

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,640
basically Forest farming has to do with

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,639
growing non-timber Forest crops beneath

93
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:19,439
the canopy of an established forest and

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,960
uh there a a lot of things can happen

95
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,040
under the northeastern forests U these

96
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,839
non-timber Forest Products fall into a

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,120
number of categories including

98
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:35,638
medicinals nuts um fruits and other food

99
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,600
crops tree syrups ornamentals and uh I

100
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,759
think I missed mushrooms right up there

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,160
I'd like to start with mushrooms uh not

102
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,360
only because I'm passionate about them

103
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,000
but also because uh from the standpoint

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
of advising uh a wood lot owner

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,038
someone's interested in getting involved

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,680
in in their Forest it's one of the Best

107
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,360
Bets as far as uh generating some income

108
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,519
in a relatively short period of time

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,560
it's a good starter crop

110
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,918
we uh grow shitake primarily that's the

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,879
one that you can kind of count on but

112
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,719
there are a few others that um that are

113
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:16,038
possible uh entries into the commercial

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,479
world of uh forest mushrooms Lions main

115
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,199
is one that's this one here uh oyster

116
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,560
mushrooms pretty common but they're not

117
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,319
very often grown in Forest situations

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,519
and wine cap staria which is grown on

119
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,080
wood chip beds on the ground and we're

120
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,399
really talking about rot and Decay

121
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,079
that's what this is all about which is

122
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,679
what makes it so much

123
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,159
fun I want to I want to give you a few

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,639
case studies today uh introduce you to

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
some of the people that really uh helped

126
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,840
us as we went along in writing this book

127
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,759
people who have a practical experience

128
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,758
with some of these crops and I actually

129
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,840
learned a lot from these folks um these

130
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
folks are Steve and Julie Rock Castle

131
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,119
they live

132
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,918
uh it's a little hard to see I think but

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,680
they live in the southwest corner of New

134
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:06,240
York State uh and they don't just grow

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,759
mushrooms hardly anyone that grows

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,240
shitake mushrooms commercially uh makes

137
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,319
their living entirely from that in this

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,840
case uh Steve Julie have an organic farm

139
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,960
where they um have uh grass-fed beef

140
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,719
also uh pasture chickens they're not

141
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,839
shown here but their eggs are and a

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
couple other crops besides the mushrooms

143
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,598
but these guys have a really unusual

144
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,840
source of income it's called the great

145
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,839
blue heron music festival this they have

146
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,279
about 100 acres most of it woods and

147
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,399
they have the festival out there with

148
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,478
about 8,000 people every summer it's

149
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,679
really a blast uh you might want to

150
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:48,000
consider it so I'm going to use Steven

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,160
Julia's vehicle to introduce um what I

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,240
consider to be the six stages of shitake

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,439
mushroom cultivation and it really it

154
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,439
applies for any mushroom species that

155
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,038
that grows on wood as a sapry first of

156
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,918
all substrate acquisition that's a fancy

157
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,399
way of saying take your chainsaw out

158
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:09,719
there and cut down live trees this is

159
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,959
nich Laskowski who uh graduated from uh

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,319
Cornell maybe eight years ago six or

161
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,839
eight years ago he um worked with me uh

162
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,720
in the nut Grove along with sonm Sherpa

163
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,279
I don't see sonm here but anyway uh

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,680
those two guys really contribute a lot

165
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,079
to the early development of the site and

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,800
uh he was the one that uh taught Steven

167
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,439
Julie how to grow mushrooms so so he's

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,038
cutting down trees for for them uh this

169
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,680
is uh what I call stage two inoculation

170
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,759
uh out in the woods uh inoculation is

171
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,439
basically introducing the fungus to the

172
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,680
substrate to the log and it involves

173
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,680
pretty simple sequence of things uh

174
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,000
drilling holes in the log and then this

175
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,519
uh spawn as it's called is injected into

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,759
the holes spawn is simply a uh a mixture

177
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,478
of sawdust and the vegetative melum of

178
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,240
the fungus we're not talking about

179
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,478
spores here nobody uses spores in

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,038
shitake mushroom production uh so this

181
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,439
spawn is injected into those holes and

182
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,959
the holes are waxed off uh to prevent

183
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,158
the log from drying out too

184
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,799
fast all right I'm on number three now

185
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,680
colonization um you put the the logs in

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,199
the laying yard and they just lay there

187
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,000
for about a year and what that's all

188
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,720
about is the fungus uh begins the

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,158
process of decay of the log it colonizes

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,759
the log it takes about a year for a log

191
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:40,158
to become fully colonized by the fungal

192
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,439
melium uh and in the meantime it is U

193
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,919
decaying the log and white rot fungi

194
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,200
like shitake are really rather unique

195
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,838
and kind of amazing because they and few

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,879
other creatures on the planet Earth can

197
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,839
break down uh the complex compound

198
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,639
lignan lignan is a hard part of wood and

199
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,880
it's very difficult biochemically

200
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,480
speaking uh to break it down so they're

201
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,399
they're degrading the wood um and the

202
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,159
wood is is uh turning into more fungal

203
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,639
melium but also it's going into the

204
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,240
mushrooms that will emerge later

205
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:19,199
on and of course respiration uh through

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,399
respiration it's blowing off CO2 and

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,959
adding water and that CO2 what's kind of

208
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,759
interesting it's I don't think it

209
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,879
contributes much to global warming but

210
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,838
um often a grower well let me say this

211
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,439
that um drying of the logs is one of the

212
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,399
most serious problems more Growers fail

213
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,120
growing shitake because they let the

214
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,839
logs dry out than any other cause uh so

215
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,278
it's interesting that respiration is

216
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,839
adding some of that water back water is

217
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:51,480
being lost through evaporation uh it's

218
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,959
being added through rainfall sometimes

219
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,278
irrigation and uh when the mushrooms

220
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,799
start coming on water's being lost from

221
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,399
that Source too the CO2 loss uh

222
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,120
contributed or or decreases the dry

223
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,839
weight of the log and it's interesting

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,440
some people think well I can just lift

225
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,560
that log and I know it's lighter than it

226
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,480
was last month and that's true but the

227
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,958
uh change in weight is not entirely due

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,759
to evaporation it's also due to carbon

229
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,719
dioxide being blown off into the

230
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,639
atmosphere well the next stage once

231
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,320
you've got those logs

232
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,319
uh you know I've done it again there I

233
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,839
wanted to say one more thing about this

234
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,160
the Fring stage um that's a great big

235
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,839
tank of water 600 gallons of water and

236
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,240
that's Julie Rock Castle um shitake is

237
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
uh very good in the sense that the

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
grower can uh determine when to produce

239
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,000
the mushrooms schedule them very

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,480
precisely for the market whatever that

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,519
may be and the way you do that once the

242
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,120
log is um colonized after that first

243
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,560
year it can be placed in water soaked in

244
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,759
water for 24 hours and that triggers the

245
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
process of mushroom formation it takes

246
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,480
about a week week for the mushrooms to

247
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,599
form so you you know if you have a

248
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,560
Saturday's Farmers Market about Thursday

249
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,759
of the previous week you can soak the

250
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,278
log and pretty reliably have those logs

251
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,240
uh those mushrooms ready to

252
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,159
uh to sell at Market on

253
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
Saturday but of course once the

254
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,919
mushrooms form you have to harvest them

255
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,759
and Julie's doing that um see the little

256
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,479
pocket knife she has there and that's

257
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,919
her basket so she's cutting off the

258
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,360
mushroom stocks and putting them in the

259
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,479
basket but she has that um knife for

260
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,879
another reason there is a the most

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,720
serious pest problem with shitake

262
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,879
mushrooms is not Bears it's not deer

263
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,839
it's not poachers it's

264
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,799
slugs and it's a it's the bane of every

265
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,800
mushroom grower slugs are very difficult

266
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:58,559
to manage or to kill um all sorts of

267
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:01,639
homey recipes or remedies like wrapping

268
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,359
the base of the logging copper or making

269
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,000
a a little circle of dious Earth none of

270
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,480
these things work very well even the

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
beer traps don't work all that well um

272
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,639
so what Julie does is she goes up there

273
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,199
in the evening I went with her one time

274
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
and she's got that little knife and when

275
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:19,120
she sees the Slugs crawling up the log

276
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,759
she cuts them in half with a knife um

277
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,600
and it tells me at busy time of the year

278
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,319
she'll spend two hours a day doing that

279
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,440
it's really brutal I guess uh nobody's

280
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,720
come up with well I won't say nobody um

281
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,560
I was going to say nobody's come up with

282
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,278
a good control for Slugs except Steve uh

283
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,719
Gabriel has come up with a really

284
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,078
ingenious idea and I'll show it to you

285
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,079
in uh just a couple of

286
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,078
minutes

287
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,278
the no they're not well you get multip

288
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,160
yes you can right in a given season you

289
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,078
can flush a log three times and that log

290
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,559
will continue to be productive for three

291
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,838
years so really goes a long way now once

292
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,159
you have

293
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,680
uh harvested the logs you better be

294
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,120
sewing those mushrooms pretty quick

295
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,759
because they only store for about a week

296
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,039
here's uh Steve there's Julie at the

297
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,000
farmers market in Buffalo selling fresh

298
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,679
mushrooms um they also have a farm store

299
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,519
which happens to be their um their

300
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,278
garage in the basement of their house uh

301
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:28,759
and they sell things on a sort of a

302
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,720
upick basis more or less um customer

303
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,838
comes in and takes fresh mushrooms

304
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,440
weighs them out and then puts the money

305
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,360
in the can uh they can also get fresh

306
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,240
eggs from the freezer they can get uh

307
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,039
Frozen uh cuts of beef and so forth uh

308
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,799
it it's a the honor System because these

309
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,360
guys are too busy to uh be hanging

310
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,838
around the uh the basement all the time

311
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,360
or the

312
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:57,079
carport meant to show you also um I said

313
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,320
that the uh mushrooms don't hang fresh

314
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,638
mushrooms don't last that long and you

315
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,800
kind of limited U even the season is

316
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,720
only about 5 months long and after that

317
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:09,120
you can't be selling fresh mushrooms but

318
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,440
you can be selling value added products

319
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,759
um they they make several of them at U

320
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,440
at their Farm um these are dried

321
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,399
shiitake mushrooms there are 2 ounces of

322
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,759
dried mushrooms in there and uh they

323
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,559
charge $20 for that 2 oz if you hydrate

324
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,759
those 2 O back up with the equivalent

325
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,799
fresh weight would be about 14 o

326
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,440
so they're actually making um $20 on 14

327
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,958
o where if they sell them fresh at the

328
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,040
market they're making $16 uh for for

329
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,198
fresh weight uh so they can actually

330
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,639
make more on the dry weight basis than

331
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,000
the fresh um they make a couple of other

332
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,480
interesting products like shitake Pate

333
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,559
this isn't liver but it's it's a it's a

334
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:59,480
paste made of uh shitaki mushrooms cream

335
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:01,958
cheese and hazelnuts it is to die for uh

336
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,920
and then also they they produce a

337
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,919
alcoholic tincture for what ails

338
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,039
you now Julia is very meticulous in

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,399
recordkeeping and she keeps uh track of

340
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,039
all her expenses and income uh she's

341
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,600
been doing this for quite a few years uh

342
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,240
from the first year they started in 2007

343
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,680
all the way up Beyond now their in their

344
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,399
19 2014 season but these are their

345
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:33,399
expenses I've just highlighted uh sort

346
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,559
of the uh combined expenses in in this

347
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,879
uh in this

348
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,719
row and in this particular year they

349
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,399
don't have any sales you see that that

350
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,879
column is sales they don't have any

351
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,799
sales to offset the expenses because as

352
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:49,519
I say it takes a year uh for that log to

353
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,439
start producing so the first year you're

354
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,318
you're spending a decent amount of money

355
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,720
and you're not getting any income but

356
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:59,719
you do start to get income after that um

357
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,560
increasing over time but the profit

358
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,920
initially of course there's there's a

359
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,359
some red ink here for two years they're

360
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,679
actually losing money actually a little

361
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,560
bit on the third year too after that

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,439
they're starting to make money and by

363
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,278
now they've eliminated this this uh this

364
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,440
deficit entirely but look at these

365
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:19,759
numbers all this work and they do a lot

366
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,440
of work for a profit of only $1,300

367
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,600
$2,000

368
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,040
$1,500 um it's a little p perplexing to

369
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,759
me one of the things is uh in the in the

370
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,919
first year they're not making any

371
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,000
mushrooms but in the second year they're

372
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,120
making uh

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,639
some um but not very many because in

374
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,600
their first year they they used uh red

375
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,198
maple logs and red maple is not a good

376
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,800
substrate as they have learned and

377
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,078
others have learned since then so they

378
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,439
got off to kind of slow start since then

379
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,039
they've gone over to uh Oak and and done

380
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:57,079
better but I put in a another slide

381
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,919
unrelated well yeah unrelated to their

382
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,120
place um this is that

383
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,480
um Northeast s project that Don was

384
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:10,038
referring to and you can see

385
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,160
here that uh we basically we trained uh

386
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,240
25 people who wanted to learn how to

387
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,759
grow shitake and make money at it so we

388
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
took 20 novices and trained them not

389
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,959
only in how to grow the mushrooms you

390
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,318
know that's pretty straightforward but

391
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,199
also uh taught them some some interp

392
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,720
Enterprise planning skills so that they

393
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,320
could uh intelligently go forth and kind

394
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,000
of put this into a into a business and

395
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,720
then this went on for two years they

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,919
kept track and fed us the data from

397
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,798
their expenses their sales their income

398
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,200
everything that was involved including

399
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:48,918
their labor and um you see

400
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,279
here okay this is a pounds per bolt

401
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,400
recall that Steve and Julie were

402
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,879
producing about a quarter to a half a

403
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,840
pound per bolt that's a log bolt is a

404
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,480
log whereas most of these folks

405
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,959
particularly the ones that that made a

406
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,599
profit were getting upwards of a pound

407
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
pound and a half to 2 pounds of

408
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,558
mushrooms and like I say I don't really

409
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,080
understand why the difference but it's

410
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,960
important to note that there can be

411
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,000
considerable difference in uh log

412
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,759
production and that can Mushroom

413
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,440
production from a log and that can

414
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,279
certainly affect the profit all the the

415
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,159
the numbers in Black here represent

416
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,279
Farmers no of us Farmers that uh

417
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,960
actually made money on the on the ordeal

418
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:34,359
and only uh several did not they're in

419
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,400
the red but I was impressed that um 25

420
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,119
people could seriously attempt to uh

421
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,559
learn how to do this and how to make a

422
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,079
business of it and most of them more

423
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:46,839
than half of them succeeded at it so

424
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,839
that I think is

425
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,079
encouraging let me introduce you uh to

426
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,640
another mushroom gr this is Steve CK um

427
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,399
his place Hawk Meadow Farm is out in

428
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,360
Trumansburg not far from here and Steve

429
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,559
is one of the most experienced mushroom

430
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,038
Growers he's been at it for I'm not sure

431
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:09,440
but I know it's in excess of 15 years

432
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,319
he's been doing it for a long time and

433
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,880
he's very experienced and very good at

434
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:18,960
it um like I say nobody makes all their

435
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,320
money on mushrooms and Steve runs a uh a

436
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,200
card business he's a graphic designer

437
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,399
and he sells these sort of nature

438
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,000
related cards very very nice um but as I

439
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
say he takes mushroom growing very

440
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,720
seriously

441
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,839
this is uh just some shots of his laying

442
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:42,200
yard right here um Steve is of the

443
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:45,599
opinion that Oak is the absolute gold

444
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,159
standard for mushroom substrate um he

445
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,158
just swears by it however he's not

446
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,760
locked into that he's the only one I

447
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,520
know who has begun to look at uh bitter

448
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,359
not Hickory as a source of shitake

449
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,200
substrate he's got a lot of that on his

450
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,519
land and he's found that bit or not

451
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,038
Hickory can be effective substrate it

452
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,918
comes on a little later so that gives

453
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,798
him flexibility as far as timing is

454
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,038
concerned uh rather than use that tank

455
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,960
of water to soak his logs he has this

456
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,038
beautiful stream uh running right

457
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,640
through his property it runs all year

458
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:20,960
round and uh Steve loves to get his feet

459
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,559
wet I mean I think that's one of the

460
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,640
main reasons that he grows shitake

461
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,158
mushrooms he he gets out there that's

462
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,440
one of his interns and he builds these

463
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,400
little log rafts

464
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,159
so that the logs won't float down the

465
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,640
stream and he can keep them in there for

466
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,240
24 hours and put them in the laying yard

467
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,880
and produce those mushrooms in another

468
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,798
week and harvest them um he has uh hired

469
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,360
or he has

470
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,599
um gotten uh two well several Cornell

471
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,319
students who taken the the uh Forest

472
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,158
farming course as interns this is uh

473
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:57,439
this is Ben and uh this is Hannah they

474
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,200
were both out there this uh this summer

475
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,640
it's a real good opportunity

476
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,400
and he's committed to you know education

477
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,400
of young

478
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,159
people now like I said he's he's well

479
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,159
organized and this is a kind of lousy

480
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,200
diagram but this is the way he scheduled

481
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,120
his crops so that he'll have mushrooms

482
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
just exactly when he needs them he

483
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:23,079
doesn't sell farmers market that sort of

484
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,678
thing he sells to retail to high-end um

485
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,240
uh restaurants and when you have a

486
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,278
contract to sell mushrooms to a chef you

487
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,519
better be on time and you better produce

488
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:36,159
the the numbers that you say you will so

489
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,200
what Steve does is he takes advantage of

490
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,400
uh different spawn types the spawns are

491
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,880
essentially um these isolates are spawn

492
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,038
are essentially clones and the clones

493
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,559
have different characteristics and some

494
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,440
of them like the wide range strains

495
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,918
fruit at a higher temperature ranging

496
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,038
from 55 to 75 whereas other strains

497
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,640
called cool weather strains fruit at a

498
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:02,038
lower temperature so consider the uh the

499
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,440
main mushroom season from the beginning

500
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,720
of May until a little way into October

501
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,960
um he'll take his whole whole laying

502
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,880
yard full of mushrooms and divided into

503
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,440
seven groups each group here is

504
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,320
represented by a stack of logs but

505
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,200
groups are actually larger than that but

506
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:26,200
at any rate he will take uh the first

507
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,278
group and soak it on um the first day of

508
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,759
of this uh sequence of weeks in the

509
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,880
beginning beginning of May um he'll

510
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,798
he'll soak it he'll take it out harvest

511
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
the mushrooms and put that log back in

512
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,278
the laying yard then he'll take the

513
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,840
second stack soak it laying laying yard

514
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,440
and put it back uh third stack third

515
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,879
week and all the way until he's covered

516
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,440
all seven Stacks in seven weeks and

517
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,840
that's convenient because a log has to

518
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,200
rest between the time it's fruited and

519
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,879
it and it produces mushrooms again it

520
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,200
needs about a 7 we resting period period

521
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,919
so by the time all seven Stacks are

522
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,319
completed he's ready to start with the

523
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,200
first stack again and that's the U the

524
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,558
pink ones here they'll go through

525
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,960
another 7 we sequence and even uh if the

526
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:16,000
weather cooperates he'll get a third

527
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,440
flush as it were so when you look at the

528
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,079
numbers these are just rough numbers if

529
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,880
you're getting half a pound per flush

530
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,678
and often Steve is getting better than

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,360
that um three flushes per year for three

532
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,320
years and selling at $12 a pound

533
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,678
and that that log is worth more than $50

534
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,439
that's a little bit more than you'd get

535
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,360
from that log as firewood so uh there is

536
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,880
some potential to make money there yeah

537
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,319
okay I also wanted to mention the use of

538
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,000
those different strains to to Advantage

539
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,519
as far as scheduling is concerned the

540
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,919
cool weather strains they fruit early in

541
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,960
the season when it's too cool for the

542
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,000
warm weather strains to fruit so he's

543
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,679
getting uh a total of about two months

544
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,278
extra production time when the in the

545
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,278
spring before the others would come on

546
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,079
and those same logs cool weather logs

547
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,720
will fruit again in the fall when it

548
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,399
gets cool so he's really almost doubled

549
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,919
his uh his season through these U

550
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,960
strategies for season

551
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:20,919
extension how SP do they have to put

552
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,319
they just take a piece and it in there

553
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,080
well remember it's it's a sawdust kind

554
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:29,720
of integrated with the melium and you're

555
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,720
putting about um two cubic centimeters

556
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,399
in that

557
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,240
hole is there a tool to do that or they

558
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:39,839
just sort of see she's holding that tool

559
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,759
right there she's uh plunged that U sort

560
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,918
of an uh injector into the sawdust U St

561
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,679
it over the hole and it just forces it

562
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,120
down and it just sends a plug of Spawn

563
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,080
right into the

564
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:57,639
hole one of those uh bags of Spawn can

565
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,798
inoculate about uh 30 logs and the bag

566
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,880
costs about 20 $ 5 so the cost of uh the

567
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,879
mushroom spawn per log is really quite

568
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,720
reasonable a couple of uh issues that

569
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,120
are going to affect the the future of

570
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,200
mushroom cultivation Forest mushroom

571
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,759
cultivation one um we hope and and some

572
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,000
of the Growers are trying out new

573
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,839
strains like The Lion Man and the scaria

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,159
and so forth um insurance is something

575
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,398
you might not expect but we've been

576
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,799
surprised to see that there have been

577
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:34,119
quite a few um farmers who have been

578
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,158
denied or canceled their Farm Insurance

579
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,479
because they're growing mushrooms and

580
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,000
these insurance companies the agents

581
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,679
they're you know they're supposed to be

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,558
experts at risk assessment uh this is

583
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,519
what they're wor worried about poison

584
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,440
mushrooms you know you might eat them

585
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,038
instead of shitake and die but the

586
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,159
chance of uh coming across a poison

587
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,038
mushroom on a mushroom log um are just

588
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,278
about nil this is gallerina It's

589
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:02,119
poisonous but it only um affects logs

590
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,759
that are far more rotten just falling

591
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,839
apart compared to the shitake log when

592
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:11,000
it's in its prime or even when it's been

593
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:13,599
thrown away um so it looks very

594
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,880
different it's smaller and if you know

595
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,158
what you're doing at all uh there's

596
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,120
really very very low probability that

597
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,000
you're going to uh poison somewhere we

598
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,398
always say that the risk of the farmer

599
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,720
cutting his leg off with a chainsaw is

600
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,359
quite a bit higher than poisoning one of

601
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,720
his customers

602
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,759
his or

603
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,240
her oh I I did mention um slug control

604
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:41,798
ear earlier this is a depiction of Steve

605
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:47,759
Gabriel's uh Forest farm called

606
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:50,398
um um Spring Meadow Forest farm and uh

607
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,119
in out in mecklinburg and you can see

608
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,798
you know this Carl Whitaker made this

609
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,199
strong there's the log with a lot of

610
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:57,639
mushrooms on it and these nasty slugs

611
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,278
are climbing all over the log and

612
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,840
they're eating those mushrooms but the

613
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:05,000
ducks come to save the day Steve has

614
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:08,240
actually introduced Ducks into his

615
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,919
laying yard and they keep the Slugs uh

616
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
pretty much under control never heard of

617
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,080
anybody doing that but it's it's a

618
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,798
really a clever

619
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,798
idea and I guess it really

620
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,278
works uh now let me shift gears and talk

621
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,038
to you a little bit about uh Forest

622
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,759
farming of medicinal

623
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,158
herbs um we're talking one of the most

624
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,079
prominent one the one everyone's almost

625
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,880
everyone is familiar with is American

626
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,678
Gins sing very valuable and I'll talk

627
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,880
more about it but there are a number of

628
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,720
others that are used as medicinal herbs

629
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,320
one way or another um not just these

630
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,798
five but quite a few others fairy one

631
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:51,439
black kohos blue kohos Snak root golden

632
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:53,918
seal uh but the one to really launch

633
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,600
into you know whenever whenever we get

634
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,080
um questions about um you know can I

635
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,558
start uh Forest farming I want to grow

636
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,558
ginsing uh the answer isn't always yes

637
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,278
depending on conditions but there are

638
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:10,359
basically four different ways to make

639
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,319
money uh growing medicinal herbs one is

640
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,000
to collect them from the wild and a lot

641
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,798
of that is done

642
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,440
um another is to grow these herbs in a

643
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:25,119
forest garden or a forest Farm um and

644
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,240
harest the uh the root for example for

645
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,759
the medicinal organ as I call it the

646
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,759
root or the rise of some of the leaves

647
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:35,440
or whatever um that's the product that

648
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:38,879
that the uh the buyers are looking for

649
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,159
or u a forest farmer can specialize in

650
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,919
producing um propagules planting stock

651
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,640
produce seeds or produce uh in the case

652
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,399
of Jin sing these are called rootlets

653
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,038
they're just 2-year-old seedlings and

654
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:54,678
they're worth about $2 a piece U and a

655
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,640
beginning grower can get like a

656
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,880
threeyear head start by using those cuz

657
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,120
the SE seed uh to go from seed to a

658
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,440
finished uh root can take um 8 to 10

659
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,839
years uh depending on how you grow

660
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,440
it then finally uh the last one here is

661
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,879
uh medicinal ornamentals um you don't

662
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,038
normally think of medicinal herbs as

663
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,159
being ornamental but um you see American

664
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,960
gin say here when it's in these red

665
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,799
berries they're quite attractive um

666
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
other things like blue Co or black cohos

667
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:32,319
just elegant looking flowers and they do

668
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,319
quite well in a shade garden

669
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,919
um now as far as Jin sing is

670
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:43,278
concerned it's a a very interesting prop

671
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,320
uh because the price that a grower can

672
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:49,319
get or a grower collected collector can

673
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,119
get is sort of inversely proportional to

674
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,918
how intensive it is to grow the crop um

675
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,079
wild collected gin sing is not intensive

676
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,840
at all the collector goes out in the

677
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,918
woods and collects the gin sing doesn't

678
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:05,038
have to manage the crop beforehand at

679
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:08,559
all that's worth $600 a pound most

680
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:11,079
American Jin sing is sold to Asian

681
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:14,480
buyers to Hong Kong in particular and

682
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,839
the demand from Jin for Jin sing in in

683
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,278
Asian countries is very high almost

684
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,079
insatiable so you have these amazingly

685
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,200
high prices uh for Jin sang on a dry

686
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,720
weight basis um wild simulated Jin

687
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,519
saying you go into the woods with a

688
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,440
handful of seeds and you scatter around

689
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,960
and come back eight years later and

690
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,679
there you have it uh and if you've been

691
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,679
if if everything has worked out you know

692
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,360
there a lot of problems but if

693
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,320
everything work works out you can have

694
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:45,398
that um uh Jin sing ready to harvest in

695
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,759
about 8 years 8 to 10 years and you

696
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,918
since it looks identical to Wild gin

697
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,440
saying you really can't tell the

698
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:54,679
difference it's worth just as much $600

699
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,399
a pound then there's Woods cultivated

700
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,360
Jin sang this is kind of thing you see

701
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,158
in a lot of forest farming situ ation

702
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,398
including the McDaniels nut Gro

703
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,480
basically raised beds where Jin sing is

704
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,879
planted and managed moderately

705
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,079
intensively um there'll be some weeding

706
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,200
and some cultivating and and perhaps

707
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:15,558
some use of fungicides and so forth so

708
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,480
it's moderately intensive and yet the

709
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:22,319
price is half of what wild jinang is and

710
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,440
then in the lower right here this is a

711
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,638
Jin sang grown under artificial shade

712
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,798
this is the way they do it in Wisconsin

713
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:32,119
and Ontario uh they have these vast

714
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,798
structures of uh covered with shade

715
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:36,518
cloth it's very expensive to build them

716
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,038
and you can only use them once after

717
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,440
you've harvested that crop you have to

718
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,759
move on to a different piece of land

719
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,000
planted at incredibly High densities

720
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,000
requires the use of lots of fungicide to

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,079
keep alternaria and phyto in check so uh

722
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,759
after all that work um you're only

723
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,599
getting $30 a

724
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,519
pound um what what you you can produce a

725
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,240
root instead of eight or 10 years you

726
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,558
can prod prod a root in three or four

727
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,079
years but it looks like a carrot and has

728
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:08,278
none of the character character that a

729
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,319
Wild Root has there note the resemblance

730
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,359
to a

731
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:14,918
person first uh Jin sang grower I want

732
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,918
to introduce you to is uh Bruce fed a

733
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,080
place uh Bruce lives in uh somewhere

734
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,200
near norwi New York he won't tell you

735
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,398
exactly well be where because you go out

736
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,558
and steal his ginsen um but anyway uh

737
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:32,319
Bruce he doesn't look that d all the

738
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:34,798
time he's a nice he's a really nice guy

739
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:38,158
but look at what what he's up to uh he's

740
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:40,918
a buyer of wild Furs Jin sang deer hides

741
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,720
horns uh full line of trapping supplies

742
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,360
I even went out there and he was

743
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,759
selling cter glands from beavers which

744
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:52,359
mountain men used to use as a as a as a

745
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:54,519
lure for trapping beavers that's amazing

746
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:58,079
so he's as close as anyone I know to a

747
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,599
true Mountain Man and uh there there he

748
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,079
is standing on one of his um Woods

749
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,638
cultivated

750
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:08,439
beds

751
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:12,119
now uh Bruce is a a kind of a clever

752
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,639
businessman uh he can make money several

753
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:18,158
different ways he is a buyer well he

754
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,839
collects wild Jin sing but he also buys

755
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,799
wild gin sing from other collectors and

756
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,278
then he sells it to buyers in New York

757
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,798
City and so forth and he makes a good

758
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:29,880
amount of money right there um he

759
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:32,599
cultivates some Gin saying like uh this

760
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,080
uh Woods Woods Woods Garden right here

761
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,959
that he's been growing for quite a while

762
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,319
um and like I say if he does it right he

763
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,480
can get well $300 to $600 a pound

764
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,119
depending on how he does it um but he

765
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,240
also sells seeds and the seeds are

766
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,918
really rather expensive because they

767
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,880
have a two-year dormant they have to be

768
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,639
pre-stratified before you sell them and

769
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,840
uh a pound of those seeds cost about

770
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:59,558
$150 and then finally as I mentioned

771
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,720
before these are the Jin Singh seedlings

772
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,960
or rootlets that uh he sells in some

773
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,878
quantity now the one on the bottom I I I

774
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,480
call Bruce's retirement account uh

775
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,480
because it's really a pretty amazing

776
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,719
story Bruce uh you know he plants Jin

777
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,878
sing every year he has about seven acres

778
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,918
that he's planting Jin sing on and he

779
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,279
hardly ever uh harvests any he started

780
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:25,279
planting about 30 years ago and most of

781
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,119
it uh until a couple years ago was still

782
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,240
in the ground he let these things get

783
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,960
bigger and bigger um until they they

784
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,559
look something like this uh it's

785
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,119
called manroot not just because it looks

786
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:43,398
like the pberry dough boy but because it

787
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,119
also is U anatomically correct if you

788
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:49,838
know what I mean the more so the more

789
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,879
valuable it is and uh the house of Jin

790
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,279
sank built I really wish I had taken

791
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:57,319
pictures of his house but I didn't uh

792
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,839
his house is amazing he built it by hand

793
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,800
and the way Jin sing relates to it is um

794
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:06,000
he had all this Jin sing in the ground

795
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,800
for you know some of it 30 years old and

796
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,440
I guess the Rosen rodenticide label uh

797
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,960
was was U taken away so he didn't have

798
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,920
access to a good Ros Rod Deniz against

799
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,519
mice and vs and so they started ravaging

800
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,838
his crop he was losing lots and lots of

801
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,639
ginsing to these mice and Bows so he had

802
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,559
not no choice he went and dug it all at

803
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,960
one time he sold it for

804
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,719
$150,000 and he tells me that if he if

805
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,720
the mice hadn't got most of it he would

806
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,519
have made at least a quar million

807
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,399
dollars but um so he used this money to

808
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,358
build this amazing house now you might

809
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,000
be saying that well you can't build that

810
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,319
much of a house for

811
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,679
$150,000 but uh Bruce took care of

812
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,559
everything he has 100 acres of trees uh

813
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,639
he did the logging he did the Milling

814
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:59,318
into Lumber um he is an experienced

815
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,159
carpenter and so he he built the house

816
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,719
from the ground up and he's a really

817
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,118
elegant finished Carpenter that's just

818
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:10,480
uh looking out his uh living room window

819
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,318
and a um a a glass representation of Jin

820
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,599
Jin sing right there talk a little bit

821
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:17,960
about Minor medicinals which is

822
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,599
practically everything besides gin sing

823
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,639
although um golden seal is worth um

824
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,920
whereas Jin sing is $600 a pound golden

825
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,199
seal is about $60 a pound but that's

826
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,680
better than than most of these

827
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,519
um black cohos for example is a uh

828
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,239
so-called women's herb and uh a

829
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,159
Collector someone who's collecting it

830
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,598
from the wild or growing it in a garden

831
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:44,159
can get about $3 a pound for the dried

832
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,079
root um and it's just hardly worth the

833
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,879
trouble of growing it for five years if

834
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,560
you're only going to get three $3 a

835
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,519
pound so there are ways around that um

836
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,559
Beth rot or as we know at Trillium uh

837
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,960
fery wand is an interesting crop and uh

838
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,799
blood rout

839
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,720
too Dave

840
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Carman is a uh retired uh telephone

841
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:11,159
executive who lives in um West Virginia

842
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,000
and he specializes in growing not so

843
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,480
much the roots of the organ of medicinal

844
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,159
interest but rather a planting stock for

845
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,079
other people this is about a I don't

846
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:24,440
know quarter acre or so it's just part

847
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,000
of his overal garden and he tells me

848
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,880
that in this block he has about 30

849
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,039
different plants uh and it just looks

850
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,318
like a random mix but I think Dave knows

851
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:36,358
where every single plant is there are

852
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,719
about six different plants represented

853
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,719
right here in this uh roughly a square

854
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:45,039
meter he's also developing a steep

855
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:47,679
Hillside with Terraces and uh he just

856
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,920
enjoys doing this and has time to do it

857
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:54,279
and makes some money at it

858
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,480
too um one of his favorite crops most uh

859
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,119
most valued crops is fairy wand

860
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,838
beautiful flower there isn't it um so he

861
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,160
starts this uh in little small seed bed

862
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,960
grows the plants for I think several

863
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,879
months to a year Pricks them out

864
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,280
transfers them to a raised bed and then

865
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,358
after a couple more years he transfers

866
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,800
them transplants them out into the

867
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:21,679
Garden in into into the soil doesn't use

868
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,440
containers um and after a total of six

869
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:29,039
years the plant is ready to be dug now

870
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,039
um Dave is a pretty small light guy so

871
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,639
he really has to whale on that shovel to

872
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,960
get it down where the roots are and so

873
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,960
he's digging it out of the ground

874
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,800
there and well that's him doing it again

875
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,720
but he'll take one of these big fous

876
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,599
root systems about like that from a

877
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,838
six-year-old plant and it'll divide it

878
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,599
into several pieces with Chute

879
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,679
associated with each one um put it in a

880
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,280
plastic bag with spagna moss and ship

881
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,919
that out to buyers to people that want

882
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,880
it

883
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,960
uh

884
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,920
but he does a couple of other

885
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,519
money-making things with the same crop U

886
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,119
he col he collects and sells seed and

887
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,838
the seeds are shatter uh from the

888
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,519
inflorescence when they're ripe they'll

889
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,719
just drop to the ground and pretty much

890
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,800
be lost and so he'll put these little

891
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,239
bags mesh bags over them to uh prevent

892
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,920
the seeds from getting lost and then

893
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:28,598
because fery wand is worth about $60 a

894
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,880
pound dry root um he will

895
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,240
actually sell some of it that way

896
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,920
too one other crop that he grows that

897
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,318
he's really proud of is Virginia snake

898
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,400
root it's an interesting plant it's not

899
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,480
particularly ornamental uh and it

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,160
doesn't grow around here as far as I

901
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,519
know but it's further south of here um

902
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,279
the flower well the seed is valuable and

903
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,119
the flower is

904
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,040
um very small it's right down here at

905
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,720
ground level underneath the leaves and

906
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:01,039
once it matures and set seed um the

907
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,598
seeds just fall and you you've lost them

908
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,480
once again so he has this really clever

909
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,920
mechanism for collecting the seeds um

910
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,519
here's a flower stock well there's one

911
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,358
right there coming from the crown of the

912
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:16,559
plant and he has these aluminum vials

913
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,119
with a transparent lid takes it apart

914
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:23,318
he's got a slot in the in the aluminum

915
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,000
vial he sets the the the uh stock the

916
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:27,719
flower stock right into that that Groove

917
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,800
and the flower is now ins inside the

918
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,159
vial caps it off and it's already been

919
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,440
pollinated in after whatever period of

920
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:37,719
time I don't know um the seeds drop

921
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,440
right into the vial now I've never seen

922
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:42,959
anyone do anything like that but that

923
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,679
way he he collects the seeds at a dollar

924
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,559
a

925
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:50,639
piece and um he also lines some of the

926
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:54,159
snake root out in a transplant bed and

927
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,159
sells some of it that way

928
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:02,880
too here's American gin sing again at

929
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,880
Dave's Place Dave Carmen um he doesn't

930
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,480
dig any route at all he doesn't have any

931
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,240
BS I guess um but what he does is he

932
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,719
grows the plant this is a very old plant

933
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,239
for seed and Bruce doesn't do this Bruce

934
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:20,118
fed place but he finds it necessary to

935
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:23,000
cover this the U seed heads with these

936
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,680
mesh bags and collect the seed that way

937
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,119
and uh as I say uh the seeds are worth

938
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:31,118
$150 a pound so it seems to be

939
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:37,039
worthwhile okay here's the last one I

940
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,679
wanted to talk about

941
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:43,199
um well actually we're pretty much at up

942
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:46,279
to time right no we end at 110 so we

943
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:50,239
have another four minutes okay um I

944
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,960
wanted to talk about one other um couple

945
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,639
that do Forest farming um this is Dave

946
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,920
and Diane cornman this is very confusing

947
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,639
because they're both Dave and then the

948
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,559
spelling of the name is practically the

949
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,838
same but this is cornman and the other

950
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,318
one was

951
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,679
Carmen whatever um these guys have a

952
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,519
really beautiful Nursery in the woods

953
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,919
it's just Immaculate and it's a pleasure

954
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,239
to go there just walking through it this

955
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,039
is just a shot from their

956
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:22,759
website and here's uh typical raised

957
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,599
beds within their Nursery they're very

958
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,079
very uh prolific and they built these

959
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,920
two uh beautiful little

960
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,480
ouses uh not ouses

961
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,880
small small out buildings that's what I

962
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,079
meant to say um and this looks a little

963
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,079
sloppy but um this is U they actually

964
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,519
specialize in trilliums and this is

965
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,280
right after the Trillium crop was pretty

966
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:47,440
much finished and dug and so forth it

967
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,359
looks a little

968
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,400
trashy um but the next slide you can

969
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:57,199
see more

970
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,599
typical well-ordered Forest Nursery some

971
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,919
plants are in these raised beds in in in

972
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,280
a compost mixture and others are being

973
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:10,400
grown in containers over there um I

974
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:14,280
mentioned before blood root

975
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,680
uh black kohos excuse me black kohos it

976
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,440
is just a gorgeous plant we have some

977
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,919
around here I don't see it too often but

978
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:26,880
when it's In Bloom it's just uh very

979
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:29,119
impressive and pardon me gen um ACA

980
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,119
right

981
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,680
ramosa

982
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,318
yeah so he grows it in containers and he

983
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,118
sells those containers for about $20 a

984
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,119
piece and remember the root is only

985
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:46,119
worth $3 a pound so this is really a

986
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:51,039
value added sort of approach um this is

987
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:54,160
a bed of of his ACA or black

988
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,440
Kash and this thing isn't medicinal at

989
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:59,239
all but you probably recognize the

990
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,039
yellow lady slipper

991
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:04,358
sedium um he's one of the few people

992
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:08,039
I've seen who actually grow cypripediums

993
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:10,119
and sell them for a phenomenal price um

994
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,239
it is illegal to dig dig wild

995
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,720
cypripediums and if you collect seed

996
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,679
from your own scatter it around forget

997
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,279
it no germination at all because they

998
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,318
have a very tight symbiosis with a

999
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
particular type of fungus so you really

1000
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:26,119
can't grow it from seed yourself the

1001
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,720
only uh way you can get it reliably is

1002
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,440
have it grown in tissue ulture U at a

1003
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,439
specialized lab like spangle Creek Labs

1004
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,358
up in

1005
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:39,720
Wisconsin um Dave buys the seedlings

1006
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:41,679
from uh spangle Creek and gets them out

1007
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,239
into the uh the raised bed and grows

1008
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,480
them on you can even see

1009
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,039
here I thought you could see some flower

1010
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,000
heads maybe maybe not but anyway these

1011
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:55,558
aren't far from flowering and he'll sell

1012
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,239
one flowering plant takes about I think

1013
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,760
about 3 years to get there for $60 a

1014
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:04,759
plant

1015
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
whoa

1016
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,960
yeah time's up okay

1017
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:14,879
well Jin saying

1018
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,159
too um aquatic plants and that's all I

1019
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,160
have to

1020
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,459
[Applause]

1021
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,240
say people when medical marijuana

1022
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,160
becomes legal in state do you expect

1023
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:34,598
some Forest Farmers to start growing

1024
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,000
cannabis not so many you know because

1025
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,000
really requires

1026
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
High

1027
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,880
people any other questions yeah can you

1028
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,599
mention the difference between Forest

1029
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,119
gardening and Forest farming and what is

1030
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,440
that difference well Forest farming is

1031
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,880
starting to grow non- Forest crops

1032
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,960
beneath the canopy and established

1033
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,358
forest forest gardening is starting from

1034
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:12,400
scratch and basically rolling a forest

1035
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:17,480
using Forest eological so a forest of Ed

1036
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:20,358
used bottom up top Emily um yeah do do

1037
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,679
mushroom Growers ever find it ever

1038
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:25,558
produce their own spawn after a few

1039
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,558
years or is it always more economical to

1040
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,280
as far as shitake is concerned some

1041
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,000
people do it it's just because they're

1042
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,640
like fanatic and stuff because they

1043
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,960
really enjoy being in the lab but at $25

1044
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,558
for 30 vogs really high quality Spa

1045
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,240
doesn't make a lot of sense but if

1046
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:44,559
you're interested in uh cultivating

1047
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:47,879
Lion's man uh or oyster and you can go

1048
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,359
out into the woods Harvest plants um get

1049
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,280
them into culture and make them own

1050
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,239
spond and a few people do that we do

1051
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,319
that as part of the

1052
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,959
research when you talk about slugs

1053
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,838
attacking mushroom crops are you at

1054
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,760
least in this part of the country is the

1055
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,719
main problematic one the uh big invasive

1056
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,240
leopard

1057
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:07,838
slug no the Slugs that I see on

1058
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,959
mushrooms are little tiny and I don't

1059
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,799
know what they're Nam they're not those

1060
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,280
big guys can you just ask Geneva if they

1061
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,280
have any questions oh yeah J one two
