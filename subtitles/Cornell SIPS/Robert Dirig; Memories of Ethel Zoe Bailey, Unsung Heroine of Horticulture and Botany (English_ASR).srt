10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,399
questions from the audience was how much

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:38,719
participation did Ethel o

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,480
Bailey um how much did she contribute

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,439
over the years and what are some of the

14
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,000
activities that she uh contributed the

15
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,479
activities that she contributed on not

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,920
only at the aarian but when they did

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:55,519
traveling so could you talk just a few

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:00,320
moments about that are

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,559
you um she in the ear after she

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
graduated from Smith college she came

21
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,239
home and she went on some of the early

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,118
trips obviously the one to venezuel wh

23
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:15,158
and the one to uh Panama I believe also

24
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:20,200
to Brazil but at some point I think she

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:23,640
mostly was and at she came along as a as

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,840
an assistant right and uh I know at one

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,680
point she uh had a conflict with bile

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,240
and uh with liberty and

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,640
she said she wasn't going as a slave or

30
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:40,280
a or or a servant or something like that

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,560
and she just didn't she didn't like not

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,599
having a little

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,680
more respect maybe is a good word well

34
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,000
we have to remember that Bailey didn't

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
drive right and that was that was

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,399
another thing that she did was uh she

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,359
had she had a license she was the first

38
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,599
woman in if to have a license and she

39
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,159
she drove them all the way across the

40
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,718
country and back on a couple of trips to

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,280
collect plants in the southern part of

42
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,359
the country in the winter they like to

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,680
get out of it go where plants were still

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
flourishing in the warmer parts of the

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,400
year so she did that and uh she also did

46
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,840
much of the organization and processing

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,560
of the specimens later um often the the

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,360
labels are in her hand I mean some are

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,039
by him as well but she did probably most

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,160
of the mounting and proration she did a

51
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:37,719
lot of that uh she also was a a

52
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:41,479
profoundly good kind of uh editor and

53
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,359
and information gatherer and organizer

54
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,919
in other words being the cator was not

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,959
just the bearing but it also involved

56
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,878
Cur curating organizing the information

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,598
that they accumulated which was all done

58
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,239
by hand in those days because they

59
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,399
didn't have computers yet so I

60
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,680
understand she also did editing yes she

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,920
did books she did she she helped helped

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,840
with a refining editing and and uh just

63
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,439
maybe streamlining some of the stuff um

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
that was and some of the I mentioned in

65
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,000
what I talked about several of several

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,158
of them and particularly the big the

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,680
Hest encycloped things like that those

68
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,639
big huge efforts like that it would take

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,040
a huge amount of effort and cooperation

70
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,518
to prod those kind so I understand she

71
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,158
was a major contributor to her a second

72
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
yes

73
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:36,759
her name is on the first one too right

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,598
and the encyclopedia is so you actually

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,919
knew her because she came in and

76
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,639
volunteered yes for the for after she

77
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,280
quote retired at age in

78
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,719
1957 and um she retired in 57 she came

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,400
in until she

80
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:55,519
1983 right and you know I had some I met

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,360
her a few times during that and and so

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,120
she worked with within two weeks of her

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,079
death as I recall was more like a month

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,759
yeah but it was pretty closed yes and

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,879
she she used to sit inside the front

86
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,719
office of theorum and it was sort of

87
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,120
surreal to go in there because her

88
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,160
father's lifesized portrait when he was

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,079
Dean was well one of them anyway when he

90
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,479
was de was in back of her on the wall

91
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,160
she looked just like him uh except she

92
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,758
was and so it was sort of startling like

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
you took a double tape when you came

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,479
into the office and she sat behind

95
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,719
a series of cabinets that had thousands

96
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,399
of 3x5 cards and what she she did all

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,240
day essentially was go through the

98
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,279
incoming SE cataloges and she would have

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,319
them open propped open and every single

100
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,679
entry in the catalog would have an x on

101
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,399
it when she she would find the card for

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,959
the company the or you know the nursery

103
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,719
she write you know like say you know

104
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,758
1980 page seven Burpee under under burp

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,759
card and then she do that every year for

106
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,000
every catalog that came in so she did

107
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,800
all of that and there are thousands and

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,600
thousands of those cards that are still

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,439
an aoran so would you have any idea how

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,360
many by the time of her death

111
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,360
approximately how many catalogs were in

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,240
that collection I think they said i'

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,680
said in here I think it was 80,000 wow

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,360
that that's a lot of it used to be on

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
the old hortorium website when we put

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,759
the first version of it off it probably

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,038
still is if they have one I don't know

118
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,439
there was a time a huge collection and

119
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,519
they had and Bailey just kept they were

120
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,399
resources for his developing career in

121
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,198
Horticulture and of course that the

122
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,638
teaching of that was new in the late

123
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,720
1800s as well not maybe not new but it

124
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,079
was being crystallized in the United

125
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,319
States at least and so he uh he just

126
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,399
kept all of them and so they had full

127
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,639
runs I think it was Harris and Rochester

128
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,679
didn't have volume one number one and we

129
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,240
did because of that because of his his

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,280
being so well organized to itself well

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,000
it's a great it's a great archive it's a

132
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,839
great archive and I would say probably

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,519
in her later years that was her major

134
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,758
contribution was the colle when she

135
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,918
retired that's basically what she also

136
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,439
it was interesting she used to drive her

137
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:23,879
car way up into her 90s and so she had a

138
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,959
she had faculty status and she parked on

139
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,759
Tower Road right near Plant science it

140
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,359
was a red car remember at the end I

141
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,280
can't remember the color I went wanted a

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,319
ride in at one time either toyot

143
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,478
or a small car and she went out with

144
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,800
bundles of unmounted plants under her

145
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,918
arms because she listened to uh the

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,639
Opera on Saturday afternoons on the

147
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,959
radio and uh she mounted plants and she

148
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,800
would bring them back Monday morning all

149
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,799
flued and that's special that's the

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
other thing it's wonderful that she able

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,759
to do all that work and and just keep

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,319
herself going you know she was she lived

153
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,080
alone until the last year or two w it's

154
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
amazing her contributions and people

155
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,279
don't a lot of people don't know of her

156
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,478
contributions she was as I said she's

157
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:16,758
anung hero

158
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:19,159
in Artic culturing Bond and she uh I

159
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,639
think she also logistically she like did

160
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,120
cooking and things like that when they

161
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,879
were in the field there's a story

162
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,560
somewhere where they they were put up in

163
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,680
a local Village in in in South America I

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,959
think and they they were given an empty

165
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,079
Hut and a chicken that was alive for

166
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,918
dinner so they had to dispatch it and

167
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:42,878
cook it inse there they they had an

168
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,120
amazing life and she she would not talk

169
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,199
about it and Liberty would talk to her

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,560
for just a few minutes according to

171
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,038
reports and then you know he said well

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,158
let's get back to the pl they didn't

173
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,598
want to do that and she came from an era

174
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,079
when women were didn't talk about

175
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,199
themselves too much but she did share

176
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,079
one time that when they were in

177
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,960
Panama she uh the colorful version is

178
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,000
that she took a refreshing dip in the

179
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,959
local pool and the log came coming and

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,879
she just just escaped the snap of

181
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,279
Jaws so that this she didn't say it

182
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,800
quite so dramatically but it was it was

183
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,679
fascinating to hear her talk about

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,319
anything like that and she had been all

185
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,120
you know in many parts of the world in

186
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,840
Europe and and all the way to China and

187
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,840
Japan I think they touched down and Soul

188
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,519
on the way Japan to China too and then

189
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,838
to the New Zealand trip he he did a in

190
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,719
1914 he did a series of lectures in but

191
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,279
that were invited in New Zealand so they

192
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,200
took a steamer all the way and all the

193
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,480
way back and it was in that context that

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,959
he had the peace to to write the holy

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,039
Earth

196
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:54,679
M well it's a long trip very long it can

197
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,559
be 16 hours from LAX airport today so

198
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,039
you can imagine on this team how long

199
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,159
and they probably stopped the different

200
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,278
points with mail along the way

201
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,159
so I have a slightly different question

202
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:08,919
now that has to do with photography so

203
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,879
we we know that we had Bailey started

204
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,759
taking pictures and he did cyano types

205
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,720
and um took Pi a lot of

206
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,159
plants obviously cultural Plants and

207
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,839
Things did did was Ethel involved in the

208
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,120
photography do you think or did she

209
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,600
print the photos or did you ever hear

210
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,879
that she was involved in

211
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,240
that I don't know I I would guess not M

212
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,439
but I know they there there were reports

213
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,799
they developed the negatives in in the

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,720
field and at one hotel they they had to

215
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,439
use the electricity for lights at night

216
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,040
or something to print them and it knock

217
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,240
whole electricity out but I I think

218
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,120
probably it was he and she did then she

219
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,480
would deal with getting them onto sheets

220
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,679
with the PS making the envelopes to put

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,399
them in so any negatives that I found

222
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,199
and he had he left glass negatives by by

223
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,519
seven glass negatives he had a camera

224
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,399
obviously they took that format um

225
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,879
really they were in paper they were

226
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,480
going to prer envelope but all the

227
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,039
reason I'm asking is all of them had

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,399
Bailey's writing I didn't see El writing

229
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,278
I don't think she directly involved in

230
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,839
that except with handling the later the

231
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:25,439
film negatives which is what we almost

232
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,000
totally have at at the theor and one of

233
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,720
his larger photo projects I think was

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,399
when he um did the work on the curits

235
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,278
when he made all the crosses and he made

236
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,240
he made sure he took pictures yeah he

237
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:41,240
did a big book of cyano types I F1 and

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,039
then the f2s and maybe further on tours

239
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,000
for years that was one of the

240
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,199
interesting things we show he certainly

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,720
put a lot of effort into that genetics

242
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,600
project and it was something was very

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,639
interesting right it was in the I think

244
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,120
it was in the 1890s when the first came

245
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,879
here okay well thank you B thank you so
